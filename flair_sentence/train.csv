__label__neg	I am primarily breastfeeding but I thought this would be useful for sterilizing pump parts and the occasional bottles.
__label__neu	I discovered Medela Microwave Steam Cleaning Bags instead and this thing went in the closet.
__label__neu	I feel badly for the waste of money but the bags are SO much easier.
__label__pos	And not space consuming.
__label__pos	Plus you can use them during travel at the office.
__label__pos	Much more cost efficient and useful!
__label__pos	This monitor is decent for the price I guess.
__label__neg	But I think I would have rather spent a little extra to get something a little better.
__label__pos	The pro to the monitor is that it picks up the smallest sounds.
__label__neg	But the problem is that there's so much static that you can barely hear the sounds that it picks up.
__label__pos	There's so much static that it almost completely drowns out my crying baby!
__label__neg	If you run the monitor on just the batteries alone ( and unplug the AC adapter) then the monitor is pretty crystal clear.
__label__neu	The only problem with that is that the battery life in that monitor is only like 1-2 nights (tops!).
__label__neg	So if you have the money to spend on a new 9V battery every night or every other night then I guess this monitor would be okay.
__label__neg	But if you have that kind of money I would suggest that you invest in a monitor that is better quality than this one.
__label__neg	I think I am going to return this for something a little better.
__label__pos	I'm very disappointed in Fisher Price.
__label__neg	They usually have such great quality products.
__label__neu	I can't believe they would come out with something this poor of quality.
__label__neg	My suggestion.
__label__neu	don't [spend] your money on this monitor.
__label__pos	This is a wonderful gate when you have your hands full as I often do.
__label__pos	We've used gates for years with our pets and this is by far superior to any others we've used.
__label__pos	We actually went out and bought a second gate when we saw how great they are.
__label__pos	This is a great large bib that is colorful and absorbent.
__label__neu	Some bibs are thin but this has a thickness to it.
__label__pos	The teether on it is a bonus!
__label__pos	It's been 5 months aleady and we've had no troubles at all.
__label__neu	It leaked the first time we used it because I didn't snap the locks into place all the way.
__label__neu	My boys are quite big for their age and they love to kick their legs and splash around.
__label__pos	There is plenty of room for that.
__label__neu	In the beginning I put the tub on my bathroom counter but when they started splashing water all over the place I put this tub in our regular bath.
__label__neu	I don't use the sling anymore but it wasn't a problem when we did.
__label__neg	My son didn't like this very much.
__label__pos	It seemed very cumbersome to put a piece of fruit into the net.
__label__neg	Often times the fruit would be too small and it moves around in the net too much and hard for the baby to eat it or the fruit would be too large and it won't fit into the net.
__label__neu	I almost have to cut it up perfectly so it's snug and baby can get to it easier.
__label__neu	My 17 month old can get out of any bib.
__label__neg	Ever since she was around 9 months old she's been ripping them off before we're even half way finished with a meal.
__label__neu	Usually we just end up stripping her down to keep food off her clothes.
__label__pos	I was psyched when I saw this bib maybe I could keep this one on her?
__label__pos	It works!
__label__neu	Those arms go in and the velcro is fastened and its darn hard for her to get it off.
__label__pos	I told her it was her special bib and how special she was to wear it!
__label__pos	She tried very hard at first and now actually kind of likes it.
__label__neu	I think she could probably get it off if she wanted to but she doesn't even try anymore.
__label__pos	Plus it wipes up very easily it covers her entirely and its a cute print.
__label__pos	Highly recommend.
__label__pos	If you really want to save money but still get a quality product buy the Diaper Champ.
__label__neu	I had a friend recommend it to me and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.
__label__neg	When it came down to it I couldn't make myself spend the extra money for something that needed expensive refills.
__label__neg	Every time you have to buy refills it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.
__label__neu	Let's face it babies are expensive and whenever you can save $ you should.
__label__neu	I buy a box of bags at Target that I use for the kitchen and the Diaper Champ and they cost less than ten dollars for over 100 bags.
__label__neu	My only complaint is that it is hard to get the pail open at first to change the bags but it gets easier over time as it loosens up and you get the hang of it!
__label__pos	If I had it to do over again I would still buy the Diaper Champ!
__label__pos	I think it is great!
__label__pos	A MUST HAVE!
__label__pos	Very unique and different from other swings.
__label__pos	Unlike other swings this swing is very roomy!
__label__neg	Baby doesn't feel confide.
__label__pos	The padding is excellent!
__label__pos	It's in the right places and with the right amount of it too!
__label__pos	It plays great music that you'll love also!
__label__pos	And the mobile is so adorable you'll both get a kick out of it.
__label__pos	My baby falls asleep all the time on it.
__label__pos	It's quiet it has adjustble settings different sounds and is just plain GREAT!
__label__pos	We love this chair (we also had the infant package)We received it as a gift and have used it since our daughter was 5 months old she will be 2 in 2 weeks it is the perfect size for her and our room.
__label__pos	She now has full access to the chair and can get on and off herself for mealtime.
__label__neu	It was very easy to put together and has a multitude of adjustments in the seat and footrest to grow with baby it is very durable seemingly knick proof easy to clean there are a few nooks and crannies which get a little crumb traffic but easy to get with a vacuum hose.
__label__pos	The cusions also wash and wear beautifully.
__label__neu	In conclusion we highly reccomend this chair the only drawback is the hefty pricetag but a chair to last through childhood.
__label__pos	Its all great!
__label__pos	The car seat clicks right in.
__label__pos	The noises are great and I love using it as a speaker for my ipod.
__label__pos	He sleeps so well in it and he also enjoys playing with the mirror and rattle bar toy.
__label__neg	The only thing I have problems with is at speed 6 it bumps a little on each end and kinda jars him.
__label__neg	Its not a lot bu it does do a small little bump on each end but only at the highest speed.
__label__neu	He doesnt mind now I think hes gotten used to the bump.
__label__neu	Hes almost 8 months now and we had to sell his fisher price swing when he was 6 months cause he was just too big for it.
__label__pos	He still has room to grow in this one!
__label__pos	I have not had a problem with using these bottles on my older model of the medela pump.
__label__pos	Very helpful to have extras!
__label__pos	This is a wonderful product for nursing.
__label__pos	It fits a lot better around you than the Boppy.
__label__pos	It is also more comfortable when sitting in a chair with arm rests.
__label__neg	However after you are done nursing or when your baby out- grows it you will not have much use for it.
__label__pos	The Boppy on the other hand can be used for tummy- time and to help them sit up.
__label__pos	However as a nursing pillow this is your best choice.
__label__neg	First of all this thing dries out wipes even if you do add the 1/4 cup of water you're supposed to add every couple of days!
__label__neg	It also restricts you in the kind of wipes you can buy forget getting Chubbs in its round container for instance.
__label__neu	The little storage area is a nice idea but it's rather flimsy and not very supportive.
__label__neu	Your best bet would be to get one of the wrap- around warmers which have cute pastel designs on them and mold to the shape of the wipe tub.
__label__pos	These take up far less room and are much easier to clean too.
__label__neu	This one?
__label__neg	You'll be continuously wiping it down when it hasn't fallen over that is.
__label__pos	I have the jungle style for my little girl (basically the same thing but different scheme) she loved it from day one played until we finally took her out (normally half hour is her max with anything) but she loved this a lot so much to do.
__label__pos	It is a huge improvement over the very basic one I had with son 7 years ago (his was basically the same thing but no toys at all on top) and he loved it even then lol.
__label__pos	It is so great keeps baby busy and entertained and smiling so big that even though you want to put them in it to get some dishes done you are held captivated at their happiness we dont get much done these days but to sit and watch her be happy always worth it!
__label__pos	It is wonderful and very affordable taking into consideration how much the baby toys are for one (anywhere for a few bucks to 7 or so for small toys) and you get 9-10 with this so very well worth the price you get your moneys worth.
__label__pos	I also found it more colorful and more to do then many other models.
__label__pos	Has the spinny things which Ella loves the light up music bus which shes still trying to push but she loves lights and music and so much more if they get bored they just need spin for new toys lol highly recommended best stationary there is out there!
__label__pos	I love this pump.
__label__pos	The silicone massage cushion works wonders and makes the pump very effective.
__label__pos	I get more milk with this pump than with my double electric.
__label__pos	It's easy to assemble and wash.
__label__neg	I do wish the white plastic dome piece stayed on better but that is a very minor complaint.
__label__pos	i bought this when my twin sons were 4 months old and they're still using it at 8 months.
__label__pos	i'm not sure what the other reviewer said about dye leaking they have thoroughly chewed everything they could reach and we have not encountered that problem.
__label__pos	we tried to get away with just one exersaucer but they both loved it so much we broke down and bought another.
__label__neu	it's provided hours of entertainment and ranks up there with the kick n'play bouncer in terms of usefulness.
__label__neu	the only drawback is that although every square inch is crammed with toys for my little ones the exersaucer came fully disassembled and my poor husband spent almost 3 hours putting the two together.
__label__neu	*** UPDATE* ** my sons loved this exersaucer until they were 11mos old.
__label__pos	then they started walking and no longer like it but looking back this has been the most worthwhile investment of all the various infant toys.
__label__neu	when your kid (in my case twins) outgrows toys every month or two you really appreciate the staying power of a toy that can last 6 months!
__label__neu	I didn't have it when I started but I really appreciated it once I got it.
__label__pos	A definate improvement.
__label__neg	The only part that I don't like and this is an individual thing is the ridges (tread).
__label__neg	I am usually bare foot and they irritate my apparently sensative feet.
__label__neu	I've put a dish towel over it to make it more comfortable for me.
__label__pos	WOW!
__label__pos	We love our video monitor!
__label__pos	This has really helped our transition to getting our son into his own room at night!
__label__neu	Our son was perfectly fine when we transitioned him to his own room but my husband and I were a nervous wreck!
__label__pos	This monitor helps us keep peace of mind and be able to rest.
__label__neu	We have had minimal problems with static and the sound/picture quality is great - even the night vision feature!
__label__pos	We can check to see his position (I am always nervous about him smooshing his face into the mattress when he rolls around) his breathing and the geographic locale of his pacifier!
__label__pos	We get a kick out of seeing our son exploring in his crib and not even knowing he has an audience!
__label__pos	Also when he is napping it makes it easy to check on him without actually entering his room - which always used to wake him up.
__label__neg	I understand from the other reviews that durability and longevity may be an issue with this item.
__label__neu	I can't comment on that because we have only had it for 2 months.
__label__neu	But for us 2 months of sleep has been worth the investment already even if it tanks later
__label__neu	I got this warmer as a shower gift.
__label__pos	It does warm the bottle to the perfect temperature.
__label__neg	It has drawbacks though.
__label__neg	I took us 6 minutes to heat up a bottle that we had in the fridge.
__label__neg	It also developed some brown crusty looking stuff in the bottom of it and all the numbers rubbed off the measuring tube.
__label__neg	We barely even use it anymore because it it not too convenient when you have a hungry baby waiting for her bottle.
__label__pos	I have to say I love this.
__label__pos	Easy to use and most of all its clean.
__label__neu	I was not told by my doctor that I needed to sterlize my daughter's bottles but I do anyway.
__label__pos	This thing is great.
__label__pos	It fits any type of bottle.
__label__pos	I use it everyday.
__label__pos	It so easy to use and fast.
__label__pos	It takes only 4 mins to sterlize your bottles nipples pacifiers etc
__label__neg	It took us almost an hour to figure out how to get the thing CORRECTLY installed in the car the first time.
__label__neu	Although it was easy to get it in there that didn't mean it was CORRECTLY installed.
__label__neg	Since both of us drive baby places in our cars we really needed another base.
__label__pos	Putting baby in teh car now takes about two seconds.
__label__pos	We are considering buying one for the babysitter and even the friend who occasinally picks up baby from daycare.
__label__pos	Definately worth AT LEAST $40.00.
__label__pos	Our son absolutely LOVES this play gym.
__label__pos	He smiles laughs and talks at the light- up star and enjoys batting the toys to make the music come on.
__label__pos	The bright colors really hold his attention and I like that I can move the toys around to change his view.
__label__pos	The mat also washes easily and dries quickly.
__label__pos	Highly recommended!
__label__pos	All of our crib sheets are organic cotton but this one is the BEST hands down.
__label__pos	I thought all of our other sheets felt really soft compared with conventional cotton but this one is even softer!
__label__pos	Feels like a smooth thick organic cotton stretchy t- shirt.
__label__pos	The fact that it is natural in color makes it even more soft than dyed organic cotton sheets.
__label__pos	CHOOSE THIS SHEET for your child's crib.
__label__pos	You will not be disappointed!
__label__pos	Our 3- month- old has been using these bottles since he was one month old.
__label__pos	The bottles don't leak at all and they don't cause gas.
__label__neg	I can only guess that the ones who had leaking problems don't know how to screw a bottle cap on.
__label__neg	At least one reviewer (maybe it was on the larger bottles; I read through those reviews too) seems to think the bubbles rising through the milk as the baby eats the milk is a bad sign.
__label__neg	They apparently didn't go through any physics classes on their way to their ged.
__label__neu	If there weren't bubbles then a vacuum would develop behind the milk making it harder and harder to suck the milk out.
__label__neu	So the bubbles are entirely necessary to equalize the pressure inside the bottle with the outside.
__label__neu	We plan to buy the larger bottles when he gets older and I might change my opinion then based on what I'm seeing in the reviews about the nipples that allow more flow.
__label__pos	But for our newborn these bottles have been great.
__label__neg	In the past I rated a diaper pail that required expensive refills.
__label__neu	In the review I stated to go for a pail where you can use your own bags that's what had done.
__label__pos	All was well for a couple of months.
__label__neu	Our diaper changing area was on the first floor in the laundry room.
__label__neg	We put a changing pad on top of the dryer so we wouldn't have to run upstairs all the time to change diapers (we had 2 children in diapers at the same time) well soon we started to notice an odor and it didn't go away.
__label__neg	We came to realize that the pail itself was absorbing the odors and we could not get rid of the stench no matter how much we washed it.
__label__neg	Now we just use an ittby bitty garbage can that holds about 5 diapers and we empty it out every day that's the only way to keep the diaper smell out of the house.
__label__pos	After researching various different monitors I purchased this one based on the reviews written here.
__label__pos	It is a great monitor!
__label__pos	It's crystal clear and we live in housing on an Air Force base where there is a lot of other monitors and cordless phones close by.
__label__pos	It's very easy to use and the extra $10.00 spent on this one vs. the 9 channel model is well worth it considering that you get 3 times as many channels and a rechargeable battery on this one.
__label__pos	I love this monitor and am so glad I purchased it!
__label__pos	Well worth the money!
__label__pos	My son ABSOLUTELY LOVES this jumperoo.
__label__pos	He had so much fun in this!
__label__pos	The colors are great it's easy to assemble & adjust.
__label__pos	If you're trying to decide between this and the bouncer GET THIS.
__label__pos	Totally more fun!
__label__pos	This is a very trim diaper when you combine it with a Thirsties or Bummis cover.
__label__pos	It hardly seems like they are wearing a cloth diaper!
__label__pos	Because it is so trim it makes it a great choice for diaper bags too.
__label__pos	They are super easy to use stains easily sunned out of this diaper and they wash beautifully.
__label__pos	They also save time in prepping; I only washed mine a couple times before using vs. 5 or 6 with prefolds and contours.
__label__pos	Just ordered a few size small to replace the x- small my son is growing out of.
__label__pos	This hamper is cute and sturdy enough to hold quite a few baby clothes with no problem.
__label__neg	My only critique is that the cover bends slightly after a while and as a result the cover can fall into the hamper if you're not careful.
__label__neu	A tab on the edge of the cover would be enough to prevent this from happening and make it a 5 star product.
__label__pos	My only regret is not having bought this right away when we started formula.
__label__neu	I had wondered if this product was gimmicky but after mixing formula all the time and storing it in bottles in the fridge I decided to give the pitcher a try.
__label__pos	It is excellent!
__label__pos	It mixes a really convenient amount of formula does so very well and quickly and with a minimum of added air in the formula.
__label__pos	Do yourself a favor and acquire this helpful product!
__label__pos	Love this little toy for traveing in the car.
__label__pos	Emersyn plays with it alot and loves the lights that change and create a Kaleidoscope of colors that both fascinate her and cause er to chatter!
__label__pos	A great take along toy!
__label__neu	When we first bought our baby home we needed a place to bathe him.
__label__neu	So we purchased a bath tub device that fit into the kitchen sink.
__label__pos	It worked well and we got good use out of it.
__label__neg	However after about 6 months of growth the baby was getting a bit big for the tub.
__label__neu	My wife began taking him into the shower and that worked well too.
__label__pos	The kid just loves baths I should add.
__label__pos	Then my wife found this Munchkin inflatable tub which we're using at the present time.
__label__pos	The inflatable tub works well.
__label__pos	It fits our tub well and the kid loves it.
__label__neg	Personally I could do without the cutsie- poo duck head and tail as it increases the difficulty of storing the thing without deflation.
__label__neu	Does the kid really appreciate the duck and recognize it?
__label__neg	Not really.
__label__neg	That corny stuff is for the adults and taking pictures.
__label__pos	But the tub itself works well.
__label__pos	He loves splashing with a little bubble bath in it.
__label__pos	Our faucet extends far enough that the tub water can be continuously refreshed.
__label__pos	The tub is easy to drain.
__label__pos	I just open the plug and wait for the water to leave (holding the plug open with one finger speeds the process).
__label__neu	I like the little heat indicator but my own testing by dipping my hand into the water is all that's really needed.
__label__neu	It's a good product that's probably a bit overpriced.
__label__neu	Gary Peterson
__label__pos	This has been the best bath investment we made for our son!
__label__pos	He began using this on the countertop in the bathroom at about 7 months.
__label__pos	He's 14 months now and it's in the bathtub.
__label__pos	The quaker on the duck's bill still wokrs and it has a handy suction cup so we stick it to the back of the tub wall when done.
__label__pos	It drains nicely.
__label__pos	We've taken several vacations and it deflates with ease.
__label__neu	I don't know why the previous poster said it took them a half hour to blow up!?
__label__pos	I've inflated this within a couple of minutes with no problem.
__label__neu	Their issue may have been that they didn't read the directions regarding the valve.
__label__neu	Many inflatable items have a closed valve so when you try and blow up the item you have to pinch the stem at the same time.
__label__neu	This allows a little flap in the valve to open and let air in.
__label__neu	The purpose is to keep leaking of air from the valve stem over time to a minimum.
__label__pos	My 72 year old mother in law blew this up at the beach with no problems once I showed her the valve trick!
__label__pos	We highly recommend this tub as it is durable and fun!
__label__pos	We just squeak the duck's bill and our son comes running for his bath!
__label__pos	This is a beautiful piece of equipment.
__label__pos	Of all the items I received at my baby shower this was the one I was most excited about.
__label__pos	It's very well designed and I love all the features - especially how cuddly the seat is and the fact that we could also hook in our car seat.
__label__neg	The only problem for us was that our son really didn't like it at all.
__label__neu	He would occasionally sit in it for 5 minutes or so but most of the time he would start wailing the minute I got him anywhere near it.
__label__neg	At his daycare they have a Fisher Price Papasan swing and he LOVES it.
__label__neg	We ended up buying one of those and sadly the Sweet Peace is sitting in our basement in hopes that any future babies may enjoy it.
__label__neu	The Sweet Peace is really nice but if you can try it out before you invest $$ since it doesn't work for every baby.
__label__neg	I didn't like these towels.
__label__neg	They are very thin and my baby felt cold in them.
__label__neu	Although I give it 2 stars cause I'm a rainforest fan
__label__neu	We stared my son on a bottle of breast milk at 15 days old.
__label__neu	He had no problem switching between the wide neck bottle and the breast.
__label__pos	Now my husband can feed him when he gets home from work.
__label__pos	So far my son hasn't experienced any gas or spitup.
__label__neu	As for the extra effort to clean the parts it only takes about a minute longer so it's really no big deal to me.
__label__pos	I'd recommend these to anyone who is breastfeeding and wants to introduce a bottle in addition to the breast.
__label__neu	UPDATE.
__label__neg	Got sick of washing all those parts!
__label__neu	I felt it was worth it in the beginning to make sure my son didn't get collicky.
__label__neg	But once that passed I quickly switched to the Playtex drop- ins.
__label__pos	My son loves his bouncer.
__label__neu	He doesn't actually bounce by himself yet he's only 4 months old but he loves to kick with his feet and grab the toys.
__label__neu	The toys are a little low but it doesn't bother us.
__label__neg	The only thing I don't like is that I can't turn off the music and leave the lights on.
__label__neg	It turns off for maybe 5 minutes then it comes on by itself.
__label__neg	My son doesn't like the music/forest sounds.
__label__neg	He starts crying 5 min after listening to them.
__label__pos	He loves the lights though.
__label__neg	I tried adjusting the different music settings to totally off with no luck.
__label__neg	We had a problem with the moving frogs.
__label__neg	Every time they moved up and down they make this loud continuous clicking sound.
__label__neg	I had to take the unit apart and disable them.
__label__neu	My son never paid attention to the frogs anyway.
__label__pos	All in all it's a good toy.
__label__pos	It really keeps my little one entertained for about 30-45 minutes at a time.
__label__pos	He's so quiet sometimes that I forget he's in there.
__label__neu	I bought this because I wanted a carrier for short trips instead of always hauling a stroller.
__label__neu	The price was good but it's VERY uncomfortable to wear and never sits on the body right.
__label__neg	My daughter screamed whenever she was in it or she made her body very stiff like she was scared beyond belief.
__label__neg	I don't feel that this carrier is very safe and it's very difficult to get baby in and out.
__label__neg	Spend your money on a better one.
__label__neu	Yes it is soft but look at others.
__label__neu	My daughter is 6 weeks old so I cannot comment about the use of the tub for an older baby.
__label__neu	Using the sling for an infant can be challenging/dangerous because it does not really craddle the baby.
__label__neg	My daughter slips down her feel fall over the sides and there is not enough give in the fabric for the slind to cup her in.
__label__neu	While I always have my hands on her while she is in the tub it would be nice to have the sling make her more secure in the torso area so I could have more freedom to actually bathe her.
__label__neg	I found my daughter almost fell out of the sling and would have if my hand was on her torso.
__label__neg	My daughter is a big newborn (10.8lbs) so her size may have something to do with the lack of safety of the sline but she is not mature enough to sit up in the tub yet.
__label__neu	Just be very careful with the sling and your newborn.
__label__neg	I bought this primarily because it takes regular trash bags we used it the way it's supposed to be used for the first couple of days but quickly discovered that as the pail gets full the dropping mechanism gets stuck forcing you to clean out the mechanism whenever it's time to change the pail and it's one more thing to wipe down if a diaper gets too messy.
__label__neu	Also my husband would load the diaper into the top but routinely forget to flip it over to dump the dirty diaper.
__label__pos	Now I lift the whole lid and toss the diaper in this allows me to keep tabs on how full it's getting and squeeze in a few extra that the mechanism wouldn't have allowed and still trap the smell!
__label__neg	Of course this negates the cool mechanism and makes it a plastic trash can with a tight lid something I could have bought for cheaper.
__label__pos	This Entertainer from Baby Einstein by far is the best.
__label__pos	My son is 6 1/2 months old and goes nuts in this.
__label__pos	Tonight he was in it for 2 1/2 hrswhile watching Baby Einstein Videos.
__label__pos	Really we could not be happier!
__label__pos	Baby Einstein productsare the best.
__label__pos	Don't hessitate on this one you won't be dissapointed!
__label__neu	Oh the little red pegs at the base should always be putdown if your baby is on the floor common sense.
__label__pos	Great product Sandra
__label__pos	It is warm and comfortble.
__label__neg	Before ordering it I read other reviews and noticed that many parents complain that the zipper does not go all the way up - I agree it doesn't.
__label__neu	I added buttons and loops couple of inches above the zipper ends it took just few minutes but helps a lot when it's cold and windy - just a suggestion maybe someone else would find it useful too.
__label__neg	Though you still will need warm hat and scarf too keep your baby warm.
__label__pos	I really don't know what I would do without the Rainforest Jumperoo!
__label__neg	My son was been fussy colicky and generally a displeasure for the first three months of his life.
__label__neg	Nothing seemed to make him happy except for me holding him while walking around.
__label__neg	Obviously that was not an option.
__label__neu	I got this as a gift at my baby shower and I finally put it together when Price was 2.5 months old.
__label__pos	It was an instant hit!
__label__pos	It is the only place I can put him down at without having him cry bloody murder after a few minutes.
__label__neg	He will jump until he passes out!
__label__pos	Not only does he love the jumperoo but all the adults love to watch him in it.
__label__neu	It's hilarious!
__label__pos	I can also attest to it's duability since my three year old has tested it out on more than one occassion!
__label__neg	Don't bother with bulky snowsuits.
__label__pos	This makes it so easy for us to get out of the house with baby.
__label__pos	We live in the north east so it is a life saver.
__label__pos	Yummy snuggly.
__label__pos	My baby enjoyed these very much.
__label__pos	The only pacifier she would take.
__label__pos	I like the clear because it goes with everything.
__label__neg	But it is hard to find sometimes because it doesn't have color.
__label__neg	We wasted precious minutes trying to find it when baby was crying.
__label__pos	I still liked the clear its unique.
__label__pos	Would buy again!
__label__neg	Unfortunately I was suckered in to all the hype about the Dr. Brown's bottles.
__label__neg	I used them for 5 months and finally got so fed up with all of the problems that I bought all new bottles.
__label__neg	The biggest problem I noticed was that they leaked after I had them in the cooler if we went out.
__label__neg	I never filled them past the line but they ALWAYS LEAKED when they were cold.
__label__neg	They leaked standing upright or laying down.
__label__neg	I'm a nursing mother and it killed me to watch my milk leaking from those bottles all the time.
__label__neg	It was such a waste and my daughter would get milk all over her chin and neck.
__label__neg	Cleaning the bottles was also a big pain.
__label__neg	I really do not reccomend these bottles.
__label__neu	I gave them to a friend who wanted to try them out.
__label__neg	I'm much happier with the Playtex nurser bottles with the drop ins.
__label__neg	They have never leaked and I'm not afraid to look in the bottle bag anymore when we are out!
__label__neu	At 37 weeks I figure I can give an accurate review of this pillow.
__label__neu	My husband purchased it when we were around 4 months.
__label__pos	Immediately I began to enjoy my sleeping hours.
__label__neu	The pillow is now even more important to me as my belly needs support as I turn from one side to the other; I lift the side I am moving to up to the belly and finally down to rest.
__label__neu	At this stage it's a little difficult to get the lower end under my top knee for hip support but that's no doubt an issue whatever pillow one uses.
__label__pos	I highly recommend this pillow to ANYone who has difficulty sleeping.
__label__neu	M
__label__neu	I bought this for my sister when she had my nephew.
__label__pos	She says to tell you that it does a good job and has held up wonderfully over the past 6 months.
__label__pos	My children are 12 years apart and I wish they would have had this item with my first.
__label__pos	It is so easy to use and makes those middle of the night feedings just a little more tolerable.
__label__neu	If you get into a routine.
__label__pos	( wake up place the bottle in the warmer change the diaper the bottle is done by the time you are and has even had time to cool for a moment).
__label__neu	I only had one problem with getting the bottles 2 hot but that was my fault from heating them twice.
__label__neu	Go figure.
__label__pos	I had a c- section and we lived in a 2 story house what trips this saved my husband from going downstairs all night was well worth the money.
__label__pos	All baby bottle supplies fit fine with no issues.
__label__pos	Seems sturdy items come out clean.
__label__pos	No complaints.
__label__pos	I got this from my sister for my baby shower and we love love love it!
__label__pos	We used it the day we got home from the hospital and for months after that!
__label__pos	My son always slept like a log in this thing and loved to just sit in it and be talked to!
__label__pos	It's very soft and very comfy for little ones the blanket that comes with it is great and my son loved the vibrate motion!
__label__neu	Once he started rolling over we had to stop using it but we're keeping it safe for the next little one!
__label__neu	A friend of our has a daughter about the same age as our son who wouldn't take naps.
__label__pos	When they came to visit they put her in it and she took a two hour nap they couldn't believe!
__label__pos	Needless to say they went right out and got one for her!
__label__neu	My son is 20 months old and we got these cups well over a year ago.
__label__pos	They're still one of his favorite toys!
__label__pos	When he was little we'd build towers out of them and he'd knock them down.
__label__neu	When he was a bit older he'd yell into them or bang the cups together.
__label__pos	Now he can nest and stack them on his own.
__label__neu	He puts other things inside them under them.
__label__pos	I love to see all the way he can come up to play with such a simple toy!
__label__pos	(I'm really big on toys that don't do stuff but encourage kids to use their creativity.
__label__pos	We also use them to teach him about colors (can you bring mommy the green cup? etc about big and little etc
__label__neu	This is the newer generation of this Safe Sippy and it seems ok to me!
__label__neu	A lot of reviews for the earlier version of this cup said they leaked but I haven't had that issue (yet).
__label__neg	That being said I don't know how kid- friendly this cup is.
__label__neg	My daughter is only 8 months and can understand the concept of a cup but this one eludes her.
__label__neu	I'm holding out hope that she will figure out the straw- like opening this sippy sports which is supposed to be the best kind for developing jaws and such.
__label__neu	The cup comes with three adapters- one for a straw for older kids one for a regular valve for younger kids (leaks a bit but just what is left in the straw portion of the mouthpiece- not a continuous stream of fluid) and a stopper for travel.
__label__neg	Supposedly everything is BPA- free.
__label__neu	There is also a removable cover and handles and the silicone sleeve comes off if you want to wash either the bottle or cover.
__label__neu	All in all good quality but maybe for slightly older kids who know what straws are about.
__label__neu	This is a great pail except for the heavy lid.
__label__neu	Be careful when changing the bag so it doesn't come down on your hand.
__label__neu	The seal did come out but it does not affect the odor.
__label__pos	This really does keep the smell in.
__label__neu	With having twins we change the bag every couple of days.
__label__neg	I wish it was a little bigger.
__label__pos	I do recommend this pail.
__label__neu	We've had ours for a few years now and it has taken a beating.
__label__neu	We often don't have the cloth cover on it and as a result the kids have torn off the cover revealing the foam padding in spots.
__label__pos	When people think of slings they think of ring slings and this Maya Lightly Padded should win the prize for best workhorse sling.
__label__pos	It is lightweight but sturdy with a padded shoulder that works for everyone!
__label__pos	It doesn't need the gentle treatment of it's more expensive silk cousins so it can handle spit- up diaper explosions. and be passed around the neighborhood.
__label__pos	You can use it to hold newborns upright or laying down and even nurse comfortably.
__label__neu	As your child grows they can be carried facing out to see the world or on your hip for a quick trip into the post office.
__label__neu	A medium works for most people so other caregivers can use it as well.
__label__pos	I am a big fan of babywearing in general and this is the starter sling I recommend most highly.
__label__pos	My husband and I both love this carrier.
__label__neu	I bought this because it was nicer looking then others and my husband was concerned with how it would look on him.
__label__neu	He uses this more then I do now.
__label__pos	It's very comfortable and convenient to use.
__label__pos	If we're busy around the house or want to go for a walk it allows our baby to be close to us (and when he's upset this helps a ton).
__label__pos	My sister has one as well and loves it.
__label__pos	Our husbands are both much larger then we are and we're able to use this universally.
__label__pos	Overall great carrier!
__label__pos	At the risk of sounding like an infomercial or planted endorsement I have to say this was our all- time best investment for our baby.
__label__neu	Our son was born with a very strong startle reflex (aka Moro reflex) and would throw his arms wide like he was falling as soon as we put his down in a crib.
__label__neu	It seemed like as soon as we got him to sleep he'd wake himself up again.
__label__neu	We'd watched The Happiest Baby on the Block before he was born and knew that swaddling could help calm a baby.
__label__neu	But our son would break out of any blanket we wrapped him in.
__label__neu	Thus we ended up resorting to co- sleeping (usually nursing him to sleep) or swinging him to sleep in his carseat (ouch!)Then a friend asked to try the Miracle Blanket on our son and I said Why not?
__label__neu	It worked!
__label__pos	The Miracle Blanket was easy to use and our little guy couldn't break out of it.
__label__pos	At first he protested for a while.
__label__neg	Then he submitted and eventually fell asleep.
__label__pos	Now when we wrap him in it he actually smiles and falls asleep pretty quickly (we also use the motion of a bouncy seat or a hammock- sleep Amby bed to help transport him to dreamland).
__label__pos	I wish we'd discovered this earlier.
__label__pos	In the future this will be our shower gift to all our friends.
__label__neu	Like L. Flack posted my daughter too looks up at the straps but with any toy you need to always supervise your child (not that L. Flack didn't by any means).
__label__pos	When my daughter does this I puller her attention to her toys and the handle bar and she gets to jumping and watching the lights flash.
__label__neu	When I see her putting her hands off to the side where they could be smashed between the door and the bounce  I always tell her (though she is only 7 months and doesn't understand but someday she will) that she needs to keep her hands inside the ride at all times.
__label__neg	I would not reccomnd this toy if you are busy with something else because you do need to be watching her like any toy.
__label__neg	If you are busying try the ExerSaucer (read my review).
__label__pos	But overall this toy is pretty safe if you are there to supervise and well worth the $40 to see you child bouncing away.
__label__pos	I like to keep the lights really dim at night so she can see the pretty lights.
__label__pos	It is really fun watching her jump around in this.
__label__neu	I can see though how it is very possible for fraying to occur but I think as long as you inspect it with each use and make sure it is secure you will be fine.
__label__neu	Last year when I was pregnant I asked other moms which cups and bottles to use.
__label__neu	A few told me playtex but most told me Avent bottles and sippy cups were the only way to go.
__label__neu	Well I decided to go Avent and here I am writing a review for a playtex sippy cup.
__label__neg	Avent sippy cups are hard to hold difficult to drink from when the cup is not filled to capacity a pain to clean and worst of all they leak.
__label__neg	The spout leaks (nothing magic about those cups) and the collars can leak too.
__label__neu	I finally decided after 5 months of using Avent magic cups with little success to give the &quot;hard to use&quot; (as one mom had classified) playtex cup a try.
__label__neu	The difference was astounding.
__label__pos	My daughter could easily drink from this cup on the first try.
__label__pos	The cup is easy to clean (its only 3 pieces as opposed to the 5 or 6(w/handles) pieces for the avent cup) assemble and use.
__label__neu	I'm sorry I didn't at least register for a pack of these when I was pregnant.
__label__neu	I should mention that I
__label__neg	We had been given a bath seat for a shower gift but when we used it we relized how cold the mesh got because the air was hitting it.
__label__neg	It made for a very unhappy baby.
__label__pos	We then decided to buy this tub because my little girl could be submerged in the water keeping her warm.
__label__neu	We used the hammock at first (BE SURE NOT TO GET IT WET BEFORE PUTTING YOUR BABY IN IT BECAUSE IT GETS SUPER COLD)It was great because it supported her but her little bottom and back was in the warm water.
__label__neu	At 2 months we took it out because she had head control and just layed her in the tub.
__label__pos	It's great.
__label__pos	It fits in the sink or you can use it in the tub.
__label__pos	Your baby stays warm and it makes bath time a little more bearable.
__label__neu	It will also last you a long time so you won't need another tub later when your little one is getting to big for an infant tub.
__label__pos	My little one loves this teething ring.
__label__pos	He loves to explore all of the different textures and shapes fun to throw and when he's done I can just put it on my wrist (it's big but easy to take along).
__label__pos	It's very durable and easy to clean.
__label__pos	Two thumbs up!
__label__neg	First of all we had to use a pipe wrench to get the thing unscrewed it was so tight neither dh or I could get it to budge and even w/ the pipe wrench it was a challenge Then there was no way I could get the arrow to line up w/ the square unless I used the pipe wrench hmmm not sure I want to carry a pipe wrench around with me when I need to pump  Oh and the suction is horrible.
__label__neg	I have the Avent Isis but wanted something I could pump directly into the Soothie bottles stupid choice the Avent is about 10000 times better even with more parts to clean well worth the time and money  With the Avent Isis I can pump 6-10 oz in 5 minutes this one I was lucky to get an ounce in 5 minutes don't waste your money.
__label__neg	I was offended at the sight of this toy at first.
__label__pos	Then I realized that my son would love it.
__label__pos	It really is not as obnoxious as it seems.
__label__pos	It is not even that loud.
__label__pos	It's worth it.
__label__pos	My son loves it and it keeps him entertained for a long time - much longer than a regular saucer.
__label__pos	My eight month old hits himself in the face with most of his toys and this has not been a problem with the step and play.
__label__neu	It is possible with the two toys on the end but I haven't seen them do damage yet.
__label__neu	They don't seem much different than toys on any other saucer walker etc
__label__neg	I have no idea why it got such positive reviews.
__label__neu	It's just a long long piece of elastic cloth (like 8 ft by 2 1/2 ft) which I could have easily stitched myself.
__label__neg	It's not something where you can put a baby in right away and be on the go.
__label__neg	Each wrap session takes like 5 minutes and if it becomes loose or undone you have to unwrap to rewrap it with both hands (and the baby might fall out while you're doing this).
__label__pos	I bought this set hoping that despite the low price it would work based on the reviews on this site.
__label__neg	Well not for us- we get horrible static reception/feedback despite moving the monitors to several different areas in the house.
__label__neu	I really like the light sensor option on the front and wished these would have worked out for us.
__label__neg	And yes battery hogs they are- I think my batteries lasted a day and a half with the monitor being on maybe a few hours each day before they went out.
__label__neu	I'll be returning this back to Amazon
__label__neu	We bought this item after extensive in- store (babies r us) research.
__label__neu	Most of the in- store models are cheaply built and expensive.
__label__pos	This bag has a nice changing pad as well as sufficient volume to store a newborn necessities.
__label__neu	We will see if this holds true later when the baby grows.
__label__neu	I own this product and the Baby Bjorn.
__label__neg	My baby does not seem to like the NoJo very much and I prefer the Bjorn in almost all aspects.
__label__neg	This product is more difficult to use and less secure.
__label__neg	The position of the baby can shift with your movement (ie. if you go from sitting to standing or if you need to lean over a little bit ); that disrupts and upsets my baby.
__label__neu	Although you can breastfeed in it I think it is easier to remove the baby from the sling before nursing (but i have to admit that I feel the same way about the Bjorn and also feel pretty comfortable nursing in public).
__label__neg	The Bjorn holds your baby closer to your body and heartbeat and my baby definatly prefers that.
__label__neg	For an infant the inward facing position of the Bjorn is also more protective from strangers and germs.
__label__neu	Maybe I'll like this product better when  my baby is a little bigger.
__label__neg	I do use it at times when I don't have to also deal with my toddler but the physical demands of a three year old require too much movement to safely use the sling.
__label__pos	It does distribute the weight pretty well and is a welcome break to the shoulder fatigue sometimes caused by the Bjorn.
__label__pos	It is also better if you are eating reading or writing because the baby rides much lower.
__label__neu	My doctor gave me the sad news that I wasnt producing enough milk for my baby and that I would have to supplement after each feeding.
__label__neu	I had placed this set on my registry because I knew I wanted to pump my supply to bottle feed.
__label__pos	Our daughter was able to go back and forth between breat and bottle at each feeding very easily.
__label__neu	It was rocky the first 2 days but afterward smoothe sailing!
__label__pos	These bottles are really easy to clean.
__label__pos	The nipples fit securely and I have never had any problems leaking.
__label__pos	The drop- in bags are disposable but very very durable I give them a good washing and reuse them!
__label__pos	Also we had Avent bottles too these nipples were much harder and much longer.
__label__pos	Even thought they were slow flow the formula still spurted out much faster than the Playtex.
__label__neg	We tried going back and forth btwn breast/bottle using the Avent bottles but our daughter would get so frustrated and VERY messy.
__label__pos	This is a GREAT set I highly recommend for new parents whether breastfeeding or bottle feeding!
__label__pos	I don't use these as wipes but they're great for wash cloths.
__label__pos	Way better than any of the cheap terry ones marketed for babies.
__label__neu	For wipes I use a combination of kushies flannel wipes and bum genius wipes.
__label__neu	While not as soft they are more utilitarian and get the job done.
__label__pos	It was the best purchase I ever made for my baby.
__label__pos	He loves it!
__label__pos	The swing always makes him sleepy so it is great to calm him and even to make him sleepy.
__label__pos	He also loves the mirror and the mobile he pays attention for long stretches of time.
__label__pos	The musics are also very soothing.
__label__pos	I think that was a brilliant idea of Fisher Price to make the music and the mobile to stop after some time but keep the swing going for as long as you want.
__label__pos	The timing is perfect since my baby gets distract for awhile than falls asleep and I do not have to worry about turning the music and the mobile off to save some batterie because it does on its own.
__label__neg	But the swing keeps moving which keeps him asleep (as soon as I stop it my baby always wakes up).
__label__neu	This is my baby's fourth SwaddleMe.
__label__neu	She's outgrown the two small sized ones and still uses the large sized cotton one in addition to this large fleece one.
__label__pos	This one keeps her very warm in the colder weather over her terry sleeper.
__label__neu	The fleece is very soft but not as stretchy as the cotton material which I am able to fasten tighter.
__label__neu	To keep the swaddle from riding up over baby's face you have to remember to tightly fasten the bottom velcro around the waist.
__label__neu	This way even if baby breaks out the arms go up above the swaddle and not below which would push the material upwards toward the face.
__label__pos	My baby sleeps very well in it naps and nighttime.
__label__neu	She has also used the Halo Sleepsack Swaddles which her arms go through a sleeveless shirt and the swaddles wrap around the outside.
__label__neg	I prefer the Kiddopotamus though because I don't have to put her arms through the sleeves when she's asleep which usually wakes her up.
__label__neu	I leave the Kiddopotamus on her crib in the open position and if she falls asleep unswaddled I wrap her up in three easy steps.
__label__pos	Simple product and inexpensive.
__label__neu	Our daughter has never really shown much interest in any toys that are free standing meaning not hanging from her play mat or over her bouncy seat.
__label__neu	She likes pulling on objects but once they are in her grasp lets them go and looks for something else to grasp.
__label__neu	Same thing with rattles and clutch toys-- holds them for a few minutes at most and then is bored.
__label__neu	Freddie the firefly is a different story.
__label__pos	She loves the crinkly texture and sound of the wings.
__label__neu	She pulls on them and rubs them to make sounds.
__label__neu	She also clutches the rings both top and bottom.
__label__pos	Don't know why she likes this particular toy but it's a winner.
__label__pos	Seems it has more features than the peacock.
__label__pos	This car seat worked out well for us.
__label__pos	All the features were amazing and the base was heavy which made me feel safe when sticking the car seat in it.
__label__neg	I didn't give it 5 stars because we had a problem adjusting the crotch strap.
__label__neu	It is removable but we had to break out tools to get the metal part out of the grooves.
__label__pos	Other than that it worked out well and served its purpose.
__label__neg	I didn't use this much because my baby cried most of the time when I put her in the carrier.
__label__neu	I used it a few times when I had to push my mom in the wheelchair and carry my baby at the same time because I had no other alternative to carry my baby.
__label__pos	She liked it a few times when she was a little older and could face outward.
__label__neg	I really didn't find much use for it though.
__label__neu	Maybe our next baby will like it more.
__label__neu	Our first was a little fussy in her first 5 months or so.
__label__neu	When I began my research for a potty chair for my son I had no idea how many things there were to consider!
__label__neu	I really didn't want anything that made noise or had lights but we ultimately decided on this chair because of the one- piece splash guard since I learned that it wasn't uncommon for little boys to hurt their tender bits on other chairs.
__label__pos	It is well- made and sturdy; it didn't tip when my son got on or off.
__label__pos	I think the main thing it did was to give my son the confidence to use a potty - his feet stayed securely on the ground and it was stable and didn't slip around.
__label__pos	He had no problem getting himself on and off of it and he liked the 'responsibility' of dumping the contents into the big potty (I liked that it was easy for him to do that and easy for me to clean the  bowl afterward).
__label__pos	This towel is adorable and seems to hold up well in the wash!
__label__pos	We LOVE the monkey theme!
__label__pos	No complaints about this one.
__label__pos	Baby loves it.
__label__pos	We love it!
__label__neu	Very cute but my son who is 6 months old doesn't seem as interested in it as I thought.
__label__neu	Maybe when he gets a little older.
__label__neu	My daughter likes this set but the blocks with the firmer sides that stack more easily are still our favorites.
__label__neu	I like that these crinkle and have different visual effects as she's starting to explore the world around her but when she tries to stack them they tumble over or cave in.
__label__neg	One of the sides is also fraying just a bit and we've only had it for a month or so.
__label__pos	Replace your outlet covers with this simple but effective child- proof plate - just slide to use.
__label__pos	It's safer than plug- in outlet protectors which are choking hazards and my 3 year old has yet to figure out how they work (he can figure out almost anything).
__label__pos	Also these plates are very modern and clean looking and will give your rooms a nice mini- makeover especially if you've painted recently and have old outlet plates.
__label__pos	I like this walker very much.
__label__pos	The quality is great as with any Chicco product the colors are appealing and my baby loves it.
__label__pos	It's very easy to collapse and set up with one hand.
__label__neg	There are 3 options for the volume - off medium and loud - I wish there was a quiet option but I haven't seen that on any toys yet
__label__pos	I tried on 4 different brands of carriers in the store and the 2 I found I liked were the Baby Bjorn and this one.
__label__neg	My hubby is much larger than I and the specifications of what size straps to buy for the BB were confusing.
__label__neg	if you wear a size Large shirt get the large etc Not very specific!
__label__neu	I need real measurements.
__label__pos	Though the large straps on the BB would probably extend enough to also fit my husband I wasnt spending a $100 and not be sure not to mention $30 is a lot less to have to spend- our budget really wouldnt allow for such a splurge!
__label__pos	So we bought the Sungli and so far very pleased.
__label__neu	I would have given it 5- stars but in comparison the BBjorn has more cushion in the straps BUT it is more difficult to un- do the straps- maybe that is because you need to break them in- not sure didnt buy it.
__label__pos	I also think that BB would be easier on the back but so far I havent used it for very long periods of time like 1/2 hr and I have yet to have any back pain.
__label__pos	These bottles were great with my daughter switching back in forth from breast to bottle.
__label__neu	The problem we have now is that I am about to start back at work I have realized no one will be as patient with her in daycare as I am with her taking 1 hour to feed her when they have 3 other kids.
__label__neg	In experimenting with other bottles she now refuses it because the milk flow is so slow.
__label__neu	I even tried the medium flow.
__label__pos	These bottles are great if you are not in a hurry to have your baby bottle fed and do support breastfeeding.
__label__neu	I have just had to stop using them due to the lack of speed.
__label__neu	I live in a condo and have cordless phones and wireless internet.
__label__neg	I found this product had terrible static and made cracking/popping sounds.
__label__neg	In comparison the Fisher Price 900mhz Long Range Monitor sounded excellent.
__label__neu	My almost 4 month old was quickly bored with stuffed animals and rattles.
__label__neu	She has very strong legs and always wants to stand with support.
__label__neu	She can almost sit on her own but still falls over occasionally.
__label__neu	With this in mind it was difficult to find things to keep her entertained.
__label__neu	She was over the play gym thing.
__label__neu	We went looking for a stationary entertainer and knew we just had to get her this one.
__label__neg	It was the most expensive on the shelf but she will only be little once.
__label__pos	The benefits are worth far more than the cost.
__label__pos	We could stick her in it for hours (NOT THAT WE WOULD LOL!) and she would be happy.
__label__pos	The first 5 minutes she is in it she just stares at everything there is to do in amazement.
__label__pos	Then she goes crazy!
__label__neu	It gives her the option to touch her feet down but still gives her the support to sit up on her own.
__label__pos	We are usually fans of Graco or Fisher Price but Evenflo definitely has the upper hand when it comes to entertainers.
__label__pos	WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!
__label__pos	I've tried the two other most popular diaper pails and am happiest with this one.
__label__pos	It is easy to change the bag uses any trash bag and does a decent job of containing odor.
__label__pos	I really appeciate all of these things after dealing with the other brands.
__label__pos	I would highly suggest using this one from the very beginning.
__label__pos	Let's face it no diaper pail is perfect but this one is the best that I've used.
__label__neu	I purchased this along with my Avent bottles before I had my daughter.
__label__pos	Six months later this sterilizer has done very well under heavy use (6+x/day) I quickly learned to use oven mitts to remove it from the microwave.
__label__neu	It does get very hot.
__label__neu	Of course that is the point - no heat no bugs killed!
__label__neu	Even got the hubbie to use it!
__label__pos	This is one of those items I could not live without.
__label__neu	I have the Medela microsteam bags for when I am away.
__label__neg	They are a great product if your child takes to the trainer set other wise inquisitive children get distracted by them specially because of the color choices instead of making them clear or white.
__label__pos	The lights with the little moving butterflies mesmerize my daughter.
__label__pos	She loves the swing and it's a great way to occupy her so I can do a quick load of laundry.
__label__neu	There are several songs so you don't hear the same thing over and over.
__label__pos	There are other settings with nature sounds crickets.
__label__neu	It's a cute swing and I would highly recommend it.
__label__neu	The motor is pretty quiet.
__label__pos	The span of the legs is pretty wide which you should measure for.
__label__neu	But it does make it seem safer.
__label__neu	I did purchase it for the $120- $130 range directly from the Fisher Price website.
__label__neu	I keep this toilet seat in my son's bathroom along with the Bjorn step stool.
__label__pos	My son loves using the potty with this seat!
__label__pos	The simple design makes it easy to clean and use.
__label__neu	I also took a plastic over the door towel hook and hung it from under the tank of our toilet (on the side).
__label__pos	This works perfectly to hang the seat by its plastic handle when not in use.
__label__pos	We have this hanging on the baby's crib and it's very soothing for the baby.
__label__neu	One thing I did though was actually pulled the little speaker device out so it hangs outside of the bear's belly and it makes it nice and loud because it isn't being muffled from the inside stuffing of the bear.
__label__neu	PLUS it's then much more sensitive to pick up sounds that will then set it off again.
__label__neu	I can be talking quietly in the room and it will set it off.
__label__neg	The down- side to this product is if you do keep the little speaker tucked in and closed up inside the bear it's a pain in the butt to turn the device on-- it's not easy to get to the on button.
__label__neu	I suppose you could leave it on the entire time but there's times when you don't really want the thing on.
__label__pos	This playyard is amazing!
__label__pos	It's such a good deal for the money.
__label__pos	It makes the other playyards look like a joke!
__label__pos	Most other playyards are dark and the mesh is dark so your baby can't see out and therefore wants to get out asap.
__label__pos	This playyard is really bright and gorgeous and the mesh is clear so baby can see out.
__label__pos	It looks inviting and fun to be in there!
__label__pos	Also other playyards are uncomfortable- no wonder your baby screams to get out- the floors aren't thick enough and the support bars can be felt through the floor.
__label__pos	This playyard has a really thick high- quality floor that is comfortable and baby could sleep on.
__label__pos	Also this playyard is really big- huge!- which makes it way nicer for baby.
__label__pos	I am so glad I found this playyard online!
__label__neu	When our boy was about four months old we took him into Babies R Us to see what type of activity toys he might like.
__label__neu	We looked at a variety of things that neither my wife the boy or I had any particular interest in.
__label__neu	Then there on the floor was a demonstration model of the Baby Einstein Activity Center.
__label__neu	We placed the little dear down into the seat and he immediately began pounding and pulling all the objects within range.
__label__pos	He loved it!
__label__pos	There was no question; we'd get the center for him.
__label__pos	Well he's now 8- months old and he still loves it.
__label__neu	He whirls the rollers spins the globe and pounds the music knob.
__label__neu	All other objects come in for a good number of twists pulls and chews.
__label__pos	We can plop him into the seat and his attention span is absorbed for up to a couple hours.
__label__neu	He's now getting big enough that he stands in it (at lowest setting) and whirls around from side to side.
__label__pos	This is a great toy and has had more lasting usefulness than most of the other gadgets we've purchased.
__label__pos	It seems to be sturdy and well built and we've had no trouble at all with it.

__label__pos	I was sick of pushing my original Chicco Mamma High Chair around the kitchen and out of the way so I bought this.
__label__pos	So far I am not disappointed.
__label__pos	I have a hefty 6 month old (22lbs) that is comfortable in the chair.
__label__neu	I have already used it many times at home and taken it out twice to restaurants.
__label__pos	It seems to fit all kinds and styles of chairs.
__label__pos	It fits snugly onto the chair so I am not worried about it falling off or tipping over.
__label__pos	I like that I can remove the tray insert and still have a usable surface.
__label__pos	I also appreciate how easy it is to clean with no nooks and crevices to get food permanently stuck in.
__label__pos	It is easy to use and priced well.
__label__neg	My only concern is that my son has already figured out how to snap off the tray insert by reaching his hand over and pulling up on the lip of the insert.
__label__neg	I also wonder if the system it uses to attach to the side of the chair is a wee bit too flimsy.
__label__neu	I am nervous that after months of taking it off and putting it back on that it will become loose and not stay on as well.
__label__neu	Only time will tell I suppose.
__label__pos	For the time being I am pretty happy with it.
__label__pos	Sticks very securely to our tiled tub walls (we've had it for months now and it has never fallen down) holds plenty of toys made out of netting so the water drips out.
__label__pos	This was a great purchase very useful and I would recommend it to anyone.
__label__pos	These bottles definitely help to reduce colic.
__label__pos	The thing I love the most about them is the fact they are BPA free.
__label__pos	It is nice to know you aren't putting unnecessary chemicals in your baby's body.
__label__pos	These bottles are great because my son had such bad colic he was screaming when he would eat.
__label__neu	The vent system in these bottles virtual eliminates any air from getting to your baby's tummy.
__label__neg	The only downfall to these bottles is they are a little more labor intensive to wash and put together.
__label__neu	You have one or two more pieces to put together over regular bottles.
__label__pos	However if your baby has any amount of colic it is definitely worth the extra few minutes of assembly for their tummy's sake.
__label__neu	One thing to note is at one point they began making these bottles with the ounce markers marked as raised clear numbers.
__label__neg	This made is EXTREMELY difficult to see how full you were filling up the bottle.
__label__pos	However I have since bought some and the markers on them are blue making it much easier to read the ounces you are making.
__label__neu	It is not that big of a deal unless you're doing a 2.30 am feeding and trying to fill the bottle up without being able to see the markings.
__label__pos	Overall these are the best bottles on the market.
__label__pos	They truly do help eliminate colic and keep your baby safe and out of harmful chemicals way like BPA.
__label__neu	Although this toy doesn't hold my son's attention as much as Freddie the Firefly does he still smiles and coos and giggles whenever he sees it.
__label__pos	Definitely a cute toy that I'm sure that he'll enjoy more when he's a bit older.
__label__pos	I absolutely love this product.
__label__pos	It gives me the capability to take care of things while my little girl is right where she wants to be next to mommy or daddy (usually mommy SMILEY.
__label__pos	). It's very easy to use although it does take some practice to get used to.
__label__neu	I only have one of the ties down so far.
__label__neu	When my little girl is sleeping in it she will usually sleep anywhere from an hour to three hours at a time.
__label__neg	However she loves to stretch and move around a lot so she tends to squirm and get uncomfortable in the tie that I have her in when she's awake.
__label__pos	Either way it was well worth the money.
__label__pos	I would recommend it to any active mom!
__label__neu	I was looking for a carrier for my little one that was sturdy and last for a while while allowing my little one to grow.
__label__neu	This was recommended by a friend and so I decided to take the leap and buy it.
__label__neu	Currently my little one is 5 months old and I have only just started putting him in the back position.
__label__neu	I as of yet can't get him there on my own but I think that may be due to me being a little nervous and him still being little.
__label__pos	However once there he is as happy as can be.
__label__pos	I love being around horses and so this carrier allows me to run around the barn feeding and grooming without my little one getting underfoot.
__label__pos	Also I have found that he doesn't feel as heavy and I can do a lot more.
__label__neu	I am a little on the small size and so the straps are on the bulky side as the other reviewer pointed out however since this carrier takes up to 40lbs I think I would rather have bulky to spread out the weight than thin and not as useful.
__label__neu	If want attractive and pretty then this isn't the thing for you however if you want a sturdy carrier that gets the job done.
__label__pos	BUY BUY BUY
__label__pos	My favorite items are the nail clipper (which you can actually hold on to) the water temp (much easier to read than the one with the tub) and the brush (nice and soft).
__label__neg	A lot of the other items I've found pretty useless to me.
__label__pos	We're about to go on a trip and the portablility (case) is great.
__label__pos	Icouldn't have nrsed without it.
__label__pos	Even my mother- in- law stated wow this really works as she was rocking her granddaughter to sleep.
__label__neg	a bit of a pain when you are vacuuming one more thing to move but otherwise a great idea.
__label__pos	This crib set is so wonderful!
__label__pos	It is gorgeous and is perfect for a little boy's room if you don't want everything to be baby blue!
__label__pos	The valance is big enough to fit even large windows.
__label__pos	Obviously the bumper and the comforter don't get much use until baby is older because of the risk of suffocation but even with just the dust ruffle and sheet on the crib and the comforter hung over the end it still looks like a complete set and is very nice.
__label__pos	We completed the look with the mobile hamper  lamp and wall hangings and our son's nursery is really nice and comfortable.
__label__pos	The muted colors combined with dark red curtains has made his room a nice little cave that is so relaxed that he frequently sleeps in.
__label__neu	And you moms know it is NICE to sleep in when you have a baby!
__label__pos	I highly recommend this product and the entire zanzibar line!
__label__pos	This may be the best mobile I've ever seen.
__label__pos	The music is delighful almost hypnotic.
__label__pos	My children love it.
__label__pos	The music isn't too loud.
__label__pos	It is gentle soothing.
__label__pos	The movement of the litle animals is rythmic and allows children to follow what is happening.
__label__pos	In addition shapes fall(gently) as the mobile turns whcih is an added delight.
__label__pos	The mobile is durable.
__label__neu	We've had ours for several years.
__label__pos	Highly recommend this one
__label__pos	This is a great product.
__label__neu	It's very soft-- although as another reviewer stated we have taken to putting a receiving blanket on the top so it's easier to wash!
__label__pos	But it's still nice knowing there is a soft cover on the pad for the times when we don't have an additional topper on it.
__label__pos	This is a good manual pump to use when you need to pump but you don't want to take out your electric pump and go through all the trouble of hooking it up.
__label__pos	The Harmony is super comfortable and I've managed to get 4 ounces in a relatively quick amount of time using it.
__label__neu	Sometimes it might be difficult to get the suction working correctly especially if you're used to the electric pump but once you do it's incredibly efficient.
__label__pos	Excellent item and well priced.
__label__pos	Pretty much like the Safety 1st Neat diaper disposal system but with some improvements.
__label__neu	We got this b/c the Safety 1st one was discontinued and we can no longer get refill rings for ours.
__label__pos	I really love my diaper genie it holds about one week of diapers with no smell.
__label__pos	It's pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it.
__label__pos	Changing bags is easy too.
__label__pos	Every new mom should have one of these.
__label__neu	When my 5- month- old started teething my father- in- law tried to put crushed ice in a Zip- loc bag so she'd have something to chomp on (she wasn't a fan of chilled teethers).
__label__neu	We started using cold fruit to soothe her gums but even without teeth she managed to break of chunks and I'd have to pry open her mouth to fish out the pieces.
__label__pos	This simple little plastic and mesh device has worked very well for us.
__label__pos	At first we used to fill it with crushed ice but then started putting fruits or veggies in (as mentioned on the packaging) and it works great for that as well.
__label__neu	We even take it with us to restaurants so she can chew on pieces of fruit.
__label__pos	I like that she can hold onto it herself and I don't have to worry about her choking (there's no way she could fit anything but the tip of the mesh in her mouth).
__label__pos	I have had such good luck with this product that I'm already stocking up on them to give to girlfriends as shower gifts.
__label__pos	I loved this tub for my baby!
__label__pos	It helps with regulating temperature and allows for longer bath play time as the water doesn't get cold.
__label__neg	The only problems I have had.
__label__neu	1) My kitchen sink has one deep large side and one small shallow side.
__label__neu	The tub would not sit all the way to the floor of the large side but I was easily able to fix by placing a sturdy plastic food storage container upside down in the sink and then resting the tub on it.
__label__pos	Was still very stable and safe.
__label__neg	2) My baby is now 4 months old and doesn't fit as well into the tub so we may have to go to a different method sooner than planned.
__label__pos	Over all I have been very happy with the tub and would rec.
__label__neu	especially to nervous first time parents.
__label__pos	i love that you can use this product for a few years rather than a few months.
__label__neu	it has toys that hang for the younger infants along with vibration.
__label__neu	but then you can take the hanging toys off and use it for the toddlers.
__label__pos	This bottle is by far the best bottle I have ever used.
__label__pos	I've bought the long skinny Dr Brown's bottles but much prefer the wide neck.
__label__pos	One of the advantages for me these are so much easier to clean than the others.
__label__pos	I used the regular Gerber bottles with my first Advent with my second and tried Advent & Soothie brand with my 3rd with no success.
__label__pos	My 3rd has bad gas & reflux she also wasn't digesting her food properly our doctor suggested Dr Brown's and I was hesitant at first simply because I did not want to wash all those extra parts.
__label__neu	C'mon having 3 kids who has time for dishes.
__label__pos	I decided to go ahead and quit being stingy on my part and get them for my daughter what a lifesaver!
__label__pos	These bottles were terrific along with a hypo- allergenic formula and these bottles she could actually eat without screaming in pain & sleep like a peaceful baby.
__label__pos	I would recommend Dr Brown's to anyone and after awhile washing the bottles/extra parts becomes second nature and really isn't so bad when your babies are happy & healthy.
__label__neg	The kneeler is not very sturdy.
__label__neg	I was not comfortable kneeling on it and I felt like my weight would break right through the flimsy little styrofoam- like cushion.
__label__neg	If that is what the manufactorer considers cusioning I'm not impressed.
__label__neu	I might as well kneel on a folded towel.
__label__neu	I was hoping for something that would be soft.
__label__neg	Also the construction of the item is not very sturdy.
__label__neg	It is made of plastic and it does not seem at all durable.
__label__neg	The elbow &quot;cushion&quot; is also not very soft.
__label__neg	It is not secure either.
__label__neu	When I leaned against it to test it it slid right off.
__label__neu	If I'd been busy bathing my baby I would have tumbled into the tub with him.
__label__neg	I don't recommend this product.
__label__pos	The pros.1)  No drilling required.
__label__pos	Works well for drawers that are too shallow for you to get a drill/screwdriver in for attaching traditional latches.
__label__pos	Also works for appliances or other surfaces that you can't drill into.2)  Easy open (for adults).
__label__pos	The release mechanism does take more strength and dexterity than a toddler has3)  Very flexible.
__label__pos	The adjustable- length strap makes it a breeze to navigate all sorts of needs in terms of anchor points.4)  Doesn't take off the paint!
__label__neu	I found the adhesive came off without marring the paint on my cabinets or leaving behind any residue.
__label__neg	The cons.1)  Can't stand up to hard pulling by toddlers.
__label__neu	My 20- month- old son has popped the pieces off with a really hard tug.
__label__neg	I wouldn't use these in an area where the child will be unsupervised.
__label__pos	I've found them useful in the kitchen and master bath - and other rooms where the kids are allowed only under a watchful eye.
__label__neg	Definitely not the right latch for your cabinet full of cleaners or medicine.
__label__neg	The water stream coming from his mouth doesn't travel horizontally very much it makes it difficult to aim the stream of water away from my baby's eyes.
__label__neg	It's not very useful for watering my plants either.
__label__pos	Looks great on the bathtub shelf tho!
__label__pos	This was our life saver for our sons first 9 months.
__label__pos	We used this for ever bottle feeding.
__label__pos	Our son was super comfortable and relaxed during feedings.
__label__pos	Was especially great those first couple months during the night feedings.
__label__pos	I could sit up in bed and feed on this him well I was still relaxed.
__label__pos	The fleece cover is the best too.
__label__pos	Super soft.
__label__pos	The other covers feel kind of scratchy and are definetly not as soft as this one.
__label__neu	I had this in an older version (didn't have the radio feature) for my 2 sons.
__label__neu	Well I thought I was done with it and sold it.
__label__neu	Now I am expecting a 3rd boy back to my Buggy!
__label__pos	I had to have this again.
__label__pos	But even better is the new features it has a radio cell phone cupholder and traffic signal.
__label__pos	Love this buggy.
__label__pos	It kept my 2 older boys busy for hours.
__label__neu	I expect and HOPE it does the same for my new son.
__label__pos	I love that it bounces rocks and spins.
__label__pos	I think it is cuter than the traditional saucers and is more entertaining.
__label__pos	I dont care for the traditional walker either ( I also have carpet so they don't really work anyway).
__label__pos	I got one as a gift and it was smaller than the Jitter Bug and I had a hard time getting my son in and out of it.
__label__neg	OK so this doesnt fold compact like the new saucers advertise to do but I don't mind b/c I happen to like this type of entertainer much better so that may be the one and only downside.
__label__neu	This is not just for a boy b/c it is a car girls like cars too!
__label__pos	Highly recommended A+
__label__pos	I was recommended this by a fellow mom before we had our daughter and purchased it from Baby's R Us.
__label__pos	It's fabulous!
__label__pos	We've been using it for almost 15 months now and still love it!
__label__pos	We save $$ on those expensive diaper genie refills AND it works great.
__label__neu	We put wet diapers in a seperate trash can (because they don't smell) and so we only put dirty diapers in the Diaper Champ so we only have to change the bag once a week and IT DOES NOT SMELL!
__label__neg	A few times I'd forget to change it (I change it my husband takes it out to the trash) and if a FULL bag of stinky diapers is left for more than a few days it does begin to smell but ANY diaper pail would stink if it was full for more than a few days.
__label__pos	So I just change it once a week and it's the best no expensive refills AND NO SMELLS!
__label__neg	.
__label__pos	D  I'd recommend this to anyone!
__label__neu	I got this product as a combo with the Avent Sterilizer.
__label__neu	((Side note. the Sterilizer is a MUST HAVE item!))It's nice to have a place to warm the bottle and it does cut down on wasting water (vs the other method of a bowl of warm water).
__label__pos	The biggest plus is it's faster to prepare.
__label__pos	The problem that I had with the bowl of water method is that I would over heat the water then have to do a cool down process.
__label__neu	I thought this product would help with that but it doesn't.
__label__neg	You can get the water to almost boiling.
__label__pos	You have to time it but again it's fast and ready to go in 6-7 minutes.
__label__neu	After checking out all the different kinds of diaper pails we decided to go with this one.
__label__pos	We love it!
__label__neu	You only need one hand to throw the soiled diaper away.
__label__pos	As for changing the liner it is very easy.
__label__neg	When I saw that the refills cost about $20.00 for 3 bags I thought oh my gosh.
__label__pos	But they last such a long time that it is very worth it!
__label__pos	My daughter is 1 year old now and we've only had to buy maybe 4 refills so far.
__label__pos	I'd say that is very good!
__label__pos	The diaper dekor does not allow any odor to stink up my daughter's room.
__label__neu	Unless you leave dirty ones in there for a few days.
__label__pos	We take them out probably 3 times a week and that works great.
__label__pos	I would recommend this pail to anyone.
__label__pos	This warmer is so awsome we bought a second one for our basement because that's were we spend most of our time.
__label__neu	It's true that our son loves warm wipes when we use the cold ones he usually is very startled and throws his arms out he also is more likely to pee during a change which isn't fun either.
__label__pos	We use huggies wipes and don't mind opening the whole lid (it's not difficult) and water doesn't go out like some other parents comented but the water does go back down to the bottom which is nice.
__label__neu	Otherwise you have to add additional water.
__label__neu	We just resoak the pad once a week to keep from having brown wipes and we haven't had one at all.
__label__neu	We will be purchasing the travel warmer because we travel to the inlaws frequently.
__label__pos	This chair made my life easier!
__label__pos	Easy to clean and basically I can put it anywhere.
__label__neu	on the floor on the chair and best of all on the go!
__label__neu	My husband loves to dine out.
__label__pos	This chair made my daughter feels eating out as comfortable as eating at home.
__label__pos	It fits many different shaped of chairs out there (as long as not a sofa!
__label__pos	=p)And by having her own table she does not really touch the restaurant table which I like to avoid in any case (due to hygiene reason).
__label__neu	And if we want to watch TV I can put her on the floor with this chair (so me watching and feeding her at the same time.
__label__pos	This is great to have!
__label__neu	While these are thin they definitely are * not* the same as using tissue.
__label__neu	They are long enough that you can fold them if you need more thickness.
__label__neu	Tissue will disintegrate when wet so please do not heed the previous reviewer's advice and use tissue instead.
__label__neu	;)We haven't had a problem with them being too narrow but your mileage may vary here.
__label__pos	Overall I've been very pleased with them.
__label__pos	They are much softer than the Gerber brand of liners (and being flushable is a huge plus).
__label__pos	We've not had any issues with flushing them either (we have a septic system and an older toilet) and they work fine for what we need.
__label__neg	The only thing I would caution is that if you're needing them to protect a cloth diaper from an oil- based cream you might want to fold it or use two liners since they are so thin.
__label__pos	But this product comes in two rolls so there are lots of sheets included.
__label__neu	We registered for this site unseen based on the reviews.
__label__neu	It greeted us on the porch of our house when we arrived home with the baby.
__label__neu	At first I thought a refridgerator had been delivered!
__label__neu	(Okay slight exaggeration  But it was HUGE.
__label__neu	
__label__pos	Fits nicely on stroller w/ velcro straps.
__label__neu	Just a little smaller than I realized.
__label__neg	Can really only fit about 2 diapers wipes and powder.
__label__neu	There is a small pouch on the side for bottle or sippy cup.
__label__neu	That's about it.
__label__pos	Good for quick trips.
__label__neg	I thankfully tested this product with my 9 month old BEFORE putting food in it and he was able to lift up the bowl within a minute.
__label__neg	Nice idea but doesn't work.
__label__pos	I like the masher a lot.
__label__neu	It does very small amounts of food easily so the baby just gets a little of whatever we're having - beets sweet potatoes peaches whatever.
__label__pos	This is way easier than making separate baby food and more interesting for him.
__label__neu	Plus if he doesn't like something I didn't have to make a blender- full to find that out.
__label__neu	(For whatever reason current dislikes include carrots - who'd have guessed?)The mesh feeder is more hit- or- miss; the baby will mouth the food end a bit and then settle into chewing the plastic ring end.
__label__pos	Perhaps this will improve as he gets the hang of it.
__label__neu	I've heard these are difficult to wash but we have not found it so.
__label__pos	(We've just avoided putting banana in it which I hear is the worst culprit for sticking to the mesh  It's been used so far with cantaloupe watermelon and apricots without trouble.
__label__neu	The feeder does need to be hand- washed; a dishwasher will not get the bits off.
__label__pos	My 3 month old loves the bounce of this chair as she kicks and bats at the swinging animals when she is in it she squeals with delight.
__label__neg	The placement of the music and vibrate buttons is where her legs are though so it will cycle on and off as her feet kick the buttons on and off.
__label__pos	My 2 1/2 mo. old son can't grasp things yet but he really seems to like his Sophie.
__label__neu	She was the 2nd 'toy' that we introduced after Lamaze's Mortimer the Moose.
__label__pos	I like her because she's a great size lightweight very soft and smooth easy to wash and fun to play with (not just chew on).
__label__neu	My son holds her against his body under his arm and tries to knaw on her head and ears.
__label__pos	He loves the sound she makes and his face lights up when you squeeze her in front of him.
__label__pos	She's gotten positive reviews in several parenting magazines in the last few months.
__label__pos	It was a little pricey for a toy/teether but I'm really happy with her and my son seems happy too.
__label__neu	I bought this when my daughter graduated to the big crib at three months.
__label__pos	She laughs continously when I turn this on.
__label__neu	It isn't very useful to lull her to sleep but I use it to entertain her in the morning when I getting ready.
__label__neg	My only complaint is the way it attaches to the crib it's a bit awkward and it damaged the wood finish a little however a little padding under it has solved the problem.
__label__neu	I have never used the remote so I can't comment on it.
__label__pos	I own two of these mattress pads and I love them.
__label__pos	They help to make my extremely firm crib mattress a little cozier for my son.
__label__pos	They hold up very well in the wash and fit great over my Simmons mattress.
__label__neu	It is a little more expensive that other mattress pads but in my opinion it is worth it.
__label__pos	I agree with others - this bag does it's job.
__label__pos	I've used 2 of them for 2 months for cloth diapers and they are holding up well.
__label__neg	My only complaint is they don't close well and would be problematic if you had to travel anywhere with it as they would probably leak and certainly smell with dirty diapers in there.
__label__neu	An added note - Don't put them in the drier.
__label__neg	Even on a low heat the lining of one of mine separated from the bag partially tore and has come out.
__label__neu	REVISION.
__label__neg	Now having used these for nearly 5 months - they are falling apart!
__label__neg	The PUL lining is virtually gone in both of my bags despite line drying them.
__label__neg	I have to order another brand because these are definately moist and leaky when full and are gross to handle when dirty.
__label__neg	Right now they leak some in the pail adding just one more thing I have to clean.
__label__neg	Yuck.
__label__neg	This was too big for my small baby even though it said it would fit.
__label__pos	Great idea and was easy to use.
__label__neu	My daughter kept getting out of it.
__label__neu	Be cautious with small babies but I'm sure is great with babies that are a little bigger where the velcro can be more secure.
__label__pos	A great product!
__label__pos	Babies deserve to be pampered &amp; this is an easy way to make sure the diaper changing experience is comfy!
__label__pos	OK I got this at my shower and I thought it was pretty neat.
__label__neg	But I am basically using it as just a glorified wipe box because it's too much of a pain to do the warming part.
__label__neu	There is this cloth that you put in the bottom that you have to make sure is always moist and you have to keep it moist with bottled or distilled water.
__label__neu	So I just throw a package of refills in it and use it just like that with no warming.
__label__neu	It looks really nice in my nursery nicer than just a refillable box of Pampers wipes or something but not worth the money to use just like this.
__label__neg	I wouldn't have bought it myself so it was nice to receive it as a shower gift.
__label__neu	Plus I like having my baby used to room temp wipes because when I go out with her and do diaper changes with room temp wipes she is used to it and doesn't throw a fit.
__label__neu	She didn't like room temp wipes at first but now she expects them at room temp and doesn't mind diaper changes at all!
__label__neu	This wrap is easy to use & fairly comfortable except that you are constantly having to adjust it tighter.
__label__neu	The pocket in the front seems great at first but then starts creating little holes in the wrap at the pockets corners.
__label__neg	My 10 pound baby bounced more than could be safe & gradually sagged lower and lower requiring constant tightening.
__label__pos	I returned it & ordered an Ellaroo from PeppermintDOTcom -- it is so much more comfortable & more secure the baby doesn't bounce or sag and it's beautiful.
__label__pos	This is the ONLY small portable pump on the planet for me.
__label__pos	Works GREAT.
__label__pos	Quick comfortable compact.
__label__pos	Worth EVERY penny.
__label__pos	If you have others to choose from don't pick another.
__label__pos	There is a reason no one has rated less than 5 stars.
__label__pos	I would actually consider using this as a daily pump at work!
__label__pos	I like it that much.
__label__neu	I received this as a shower gift and have used it three times so far.
__label__neg	The shower portion of it stopped working after the second use.
__label__neg	The button needed a lot of pressure to make it work and then it gets stuck.
__label__neg	When you release the button the shower continues to spray.
__label__neg	Now it no longer works at all.
__label__neg	It's also difficult to hold the shower head and hold the button down they could've had a better design there.
__label__neu	The size of the tub isn't great either but then again my baby was born at 23 so I guess a smaller baby would fit better.
__label__neg	The sling they give you isn't so great for a newborn either my little one slid down and rolled side to side and he appeared to be very uncomfortable.
__label__neu	So I bought the BRU teddy bear sponge to put inside the tub and he lays on that much better.
__label__neu	The shower idea is great it just need a lot of improving.
__label__pos	This product exceeded my expectations.
__label__neu	My four month old isn't teething but is at the age where he's shoving everything into his mouth.
__label__pos	This teether is perfect for him because I put it into his mouth and his little hands can get ahold of it to manipulate it.
__label__pos	The entire thing is soft so unlike his binky he won't chew down on hard plastic.
__label__pos	I have a basket full of age appropriate toys for him but this is by far his favorite and very portable at that!
__label__neu	i have 2yo twins who love using chopsticks but as a wohm i don't have the time to endlessly wrap rubber bands around disposable chopsticks to help them.
__label__pos	i found these online and they're great!
__label__pos	even at 2yo my boys are too old to use the stage #1 training bridge but they love using chopsticks just like mommy and daddy and have gotten quite good at feeding themselves bite- size bits of chicken and sticky rice.
__label__pos	we're asian and trust me these trainers have made my life much easier.
__label__pos	to boot we can adjust the grip of the chopsticks to accomodate their little hands so my kids can really learn technique and not hold them like little tongs.
__label__pos	This product works great.
__label__pos	Perfect for kids.
__label__pos	Much faster then any other thermometer.
__label__pos	My 4 yr old likes that it doesn't go in the ear.
__label__pos	Works great on my 7 month old as well.
__label__pos	I highly recommend.
__label__pos	A must for parents.
__label__neu	I was really struggling taking my 2 month old out in the cold.
__label__neu	Bundle her up in a coat and hat blankets.
__label__neu	Then we would get to the car where the heat is on and she would be sweating.
__label__pos	I love the Bundle Me.
__label__pos	It is easy to install and keeps my daughter toasty warm.
__label__pos	It is easy to pull back once we get in the car so she is not sweating in the heat.
__label__neg	I did not believe myself to have large nipples but I was frustrated at how little milk I was getting with the standard size breastshield even with a hospital- grade pump (the Symphony).
__label__neu	A lactation consultant suggested I try a larger breastshield.
__label__neu	Indeed these bring a little more breast into the cylinder which has resulted in slightly more milk being expressed.
__label__neg	I also tried the SoftFit which didn't do a thing for me.
__label__pos	These are worth a try even if you don't think you have large nipples.
__label__neu	I purchased these bags when I returned to work and began pumping more often.
__label__neg	What a waste!
__label__neg	The twist tie design is both clumsy and ineffective.
__label__neg	You can never tie them tight enough and spills are frequent.
__label__neg	In additon to this the cost is ridiculous.
__label__pos	The Gerber bags with the zip lock design are much more economical and are leak proof.
__label__neu	They can be found at most retail stores including Target and Walmart.
__label__neg	These bags do not measure up to the Medela name and they should consider a new design.
__label__neg	Returning to work and continuing to nurse your baby is hard enough without the hassle of these bags.
__label__neu	We had a first years monitor with our older son and bought this when we had a second.
__label__neg	I wish we had saved our money.
__label__neg	Its major drawback are.
__label__neg	very loud low volume setting very bright monitor lights (like having a nightlight near the bed -- I have in fact used it for that purpose when getting up in the middle of the night) loses reception frequently and if the power goes out (which seems to happen to us a lot) it shuts off and you have to go into the childs room to turn it back on (not the case with our other monitor).
__label__neg	Most importantly it is a failure as a two- room monitor.
__label__neg	I found it such a hassle to program that we never used it as a two room monitor.
__label__neu	I've used it for one son and kept using the first year monitor I've had for years.
__label__neg	buy something different.
__label__neu	Got this bouncer at the baby shower last summer.
__label__neg	While we are still using it (my son is 6 months old but has the size of a one year old child) we had to remove the toy bar when he was about 3-4 months old since he managed to grab both ends end remove it himself almost injuring his eyes.
__label__neg	I duck- taped it for a while but that makes it kind of hard to put the baby in or take it out!
__label__neg	It it should not be the solution anyway!
__label__neg	I reported this already to consumer safety unfortunately Combi the manufacturer does not give you the option to write an email but just to call - and only between certain hours SMILEY which makes it kind of hard to reach them.
__label__neu	What I liked about it was the modern design the fact that it is not made entirely of plastic and at least in theory the possibility of using it with your iPod - which never worked for us SMILEY.
__label__neu	The music it comes with is OK the sound average and the vibration fine for a young baby - at 3-4 months my son got pretty bored of it.
__label__neu	We ended up using it in front of the door where I can put him in for a few seconds until I put my shoes on when we go for a walk I would not recommend this product first of all because of the very easy to remove toy bar.
__label__neg	This product is one of the biggest wastes of money in baby gear I have purchased!
__label__neg	It does not stay securely in place and is constantly moving so that baby is either out of view or it completely falls back flat.
__label__neg	I've completely stopped using it at this point because I got tired of constantly messing with it.
__label__neg	Whoever thought it would be a great idea to secure a mirror over a baby using velcro wasn't thinking things through.
__label__neu	These are the only bottles my 8 week old will drink from.
__label__neg	Its not convinient to constantly breast- feed and these bottles are perfect.
__label__pos	The nipple on this bottle is so real and is the only one my boy will use.
__label__neu	My son did have gas problems but after these bottles the problem fanished!
__label__pos	I find them really easy to clean and I have used these bottles with my now 20 month old twin boys (just without the natural nipples) The bottom piece is a godsend since I dont have to SCRUB to get the gunk out of the bottle!
__label__pos	These are truely great bottles and they dont leak either!
__label__neu	At first we debated over spending this much but now we are so glad we did.
__label__pos	It is worth the price!
__label__pos	Our infant sits so snugly in the swing so she sleeps in it easily.
__label__neu	She hates being put down but doesn't mind the swing as much.
__label__neu	The music will drive you crazy after awhile so thank goodness for volume control!
__label__pos	There are several levels to turn it up or down to unlike most noisy toys.
__label__pos	This sits nicely in our living room.
__label__pos	It's perfect!
__label__neu	I think the title says it all.
__label__neg	We have a 1- month- old and we've tried it several times and he hates it with a passion.
__label__neg	Also it's very awkward to get in and out of.
__label__neu	My wife purchased a wrap carrier (Maya wrap?) and the difference is like night- and- day.
__label__pos	Not only is the design elegantly simpler (wrap inspired vs. backpack inspired with 80 hooks snaps and buckles) but he loves it.
__label__pos	The wrap design seems to really promote snuggling unlike the baby Bjorn.
__label__neg	It leaks every time I use it.
__label__neg	It's impossible to snap back together if by some miracle you can change the size.
__label__neg	I have to put towels underneath the tub to collect all the water that leaks out of it.
__label__neu	I love the sling but I am tempted to beat the tub with a hammer just to take out my frustrations with it.
__label__neu	If I could get down on the floor and bathe my son in the big tub with this tub inside it would probably be easier (but I don't think my knees would appreciate it.
__label__neg	I received this as a gift and didn't check the reviews before using I should have.
__label__neg	I am currently looking for another solution to this piece of junk.
__label__neg	Buy at your own risk.
__label__pos	The chair was exactly what we were looking for.
__label__neu	Our dining area is fairly small so using our existing dining chair does save space.
__label__pos	The booster chair feels secure as it secures both behind and under the dining chair with buckle straps.
__label__neu	It also has non- skid rubber feet on the bottom of all four corners.
__label__pos	The 3- point to 5- point harness is helpful for keeping the baby in place.
__label__neg	We were using one of those cheapy plastic block booster chairs and our 7- month old kept slouching underneath the tray.
__label__pos	The contoured seat in the Space Saver High Chair helps to prevent that.
__label__neu	The adjustable height was useful for raising the tray to just above our table level so we could slide the whole chair underneath when not in use.
__label__pos	I'm not sure when we'd recline the seat but I guess it's a nice option to have.
__label__neu	The chair reminds me of a car seat and as such keeps our baby in place while feeding.
__label__pos	The one- handed release of the tray and the highly adjustable settings are convenient options.
__label__pos	I don't think I could ask for anything more out of a booster chair.
__label__neu	Perhaps a built- in iPod adapter with speakers built into the tray or something.
__label__pos	Just kidding SMILEY.
__label__neu	The model I purchased is the J5933 but there is another model L1907.
__label__neu	According to a couple of customers who researched them the differences are basically color.
__label__neu	Kudos to them for researching them and clearing that up.
__label__neu	My mother- in- law keeps offering to buy me a high chair and I tell her the honest truth.
__label__pos	I am thrilled with this little booster seat and I have no desire to bring a big traditional high chair into our small dining room.
__label__pos	I keep telling people that this chair is one of the few things I did right the first time.
__label__pos	It is unobtrusive and portable it grows with the child and -- contrary to what grandma thinks -- it seems to be perfectly comfortable for my child.
__label__neu	We have been using it since my son was four months old.
__label__pos	He is now 14 months and it is still perfect.
__label__pos	The tray is just the right height.
__label__pos	He can reach his food better in this little chair than he can in the fancy high chair that grandma has at her house.
__label__pos	My son has always been a big chubby baby but we still use the tray on the middle of the three settings so I'm not worried that he will feel constricted as he grows bigger.
__label__pos	The chair is easy to clean and it looks cute attached to one of our dining chairs.
__label__pos	It is a breeze to take down and set up -- we take it everywhere.
__label__pos	I cannot imagine why anyone would choose a full- size high chair over this little gem!
__label__pos	This pump is the best for a stay at home mom.
__label__pos	It's not overly expensive compared to some and the quality can't be beat.
__label__pos	Ask any lactation consultant and they will tell you that Medela is the best commercial grade pump you can get.
__label__neu	The reason I needed to get a breast pump was for occasional pumping.
__label__pos	Because of the portable motor you can actually pump in your car or even at the movie theatre(if you really want to the point is it's practical.
__label__pos	You can pump and rock your baby at the same time.
__label__pos	You can pump and use your other hand to cook.
__label__pos	This pump is also great for relieving engorgement.
__label__pos	There is nothing more satisfying than a child smile and laugh.
__label__pos	That's what the exersaucer made for both of my sons.
__label__neu	We brough it for my older son when he was 5 mounths old.
__label__neu	We made him choose from all the one they had at Babies'R'Us.
__label__pos	He took this one over all the other pricy ones.
__label__pos	Don't hesitate !
__label__neu	I loved this pillow while I was pregnant.
__label__neu	I used it every night from the day I got it to the a week or so after I delivered.
__label__pos	It was wonderful.
__label__pos	I never had a problem sleeping.
__label__pos	It took up a lot of room in our bed but my husband dog myself and pillow were all still able to sleep in our queen size bed with little complaining from my husband.
__label__pos	Works well as diaper pail but it's awesome as a bathroom garbage can.
__label__pos	No mess no smell.
__label__pos	Very easy to replace garbage bags you do not have to touch anything.
__label__neu	Got it as a gift and was very skeptical about it at first.
__label__neu	(It's only 100ft to the garbage  shoot outside the apartment).
__label__neu	That opinion changed quickly after the first night I had to wake up to change diapers.
__label__neu	It holds about 2 days of diapers so never get a chance to stink things up.
__label__neu	Besides you baby will probably poop only 1-2 times /day.
__label__pos	I cannot imagine learning to breastfeed without a Boppy.
__label__pos	The Boppy helps you comfortably rest your baby while you nurse.
__label__neu	I even took this in the car with me on road trips.
__label__pos	When we pulled over it was much easier to feed her in the car with the help of the Boppy.
__label__neu	I would recommend purchasing 2 covers.
__label__neg	Boppy Flowers and Chocolate Slipcover PinkIt is a bummer in the middle of the night if your baby spits- up or has a blow- through diaper.
__label__neu	The Boppy is also great when your baby is learning to sit on her own.
__label__pos	It offers great support and if she has a tummy ache she will enjoy laying on it.
__label__pos	I got it for my 2 month old who likes melodies and he was enthralled with it!
__label__neu	Now after a month and a half he's a little bored by it (probably because we've played with it several times a day) so I may put it away for a little while but I'm sure he'll continue to enjoy it later.
__label__pos	This mat was a no brainer for me after getting theFisher- Price Rainforest Open- Top Cradle Swingand seeing how wonderful the colors and brightness of the product are.
__label__neu	No it is not meant for travelling and the mat is perfectly thick enough even on my hardwood floors.
__label__neg	The only issues I had with it was the amount of time spent trying to figure out how to get the butterflies to move (they don't) and that there are no extra rings to add length (a little short for a 3 month old to view AND grab at the same time) or to attach more of your own toys.
__label__pos	But those are insignificant and not problems compared to how many hours she has played with it and believe it or not her activity on the playmat has tired her out so that she finally slept through the night!
__label__pos	That in it and of itself makes this worth so much more than I paid for it as far as I am concerned.
__label__pos	No matter which one you end up choosing be sure to get a playmat.
__label__pos	It was incredible how quickly she has developed since we bought ours a week ago.
__label__pos	She talks so much more now coos smiles laughs and just makes crazy noises and loves kicking the elephant rattle and looking at herself in the mirror.
__label__pos	Also I posted some customer images for a better idea.
__label__pos	Enjoy!
__label__pos	This is one of my most used items from my registry.
__label__neu	Originally I thought I would sterilize my bottles in the dishwasher but someone pointed out to me that that would require running the dishwasher every day.
__label__neu	Instead you can throw your bottles nipples and pacifiers in here as needed and have them sterilized in 7 minutes.
__label__pos	It is absolutely something I would recommend.
__label__pos	This is a great carrier!
__label__pos	My son loves to fall asleep in it while I am working.
__label__pos	He was fortunately big enough to be carried around it in from day 1 but your child must be 21 inches to start using it.
__label__neg	I used this pump once a day or less and it stopped working after about 6 weeks.
__label__pos	While it was working it worked well and I liked being able to have one hand free while pumping.
__label__pos	My baby seems to like it.
__label__pos	The bright color seems to catch her eyes.
__label__neu	She was less than 4 months old when I put her in ExerSaucer (a bit too early) so I had to put blanket around her body to keep her body straight but she was doing okay in there.
__label__pos	I was amazed how fast she learnt how to control her hands there.
__label__pos	Overall I like this ExerSaucer.
__label__neg	But there are 2 minor things I found.1.
__label__neu	When you pull the monkey the audio says the triangle is blue.
__label__neu	But under sunlight that triangle is green.2.
__label__neg	When you press button on the small vechicle sometimes the audio is some laughter from children but personally I think that is a little bit scary.
__label__pos	But my baby has no problem with that.
__label__pos	These are great soothers for our twin boys.
__label__pos	It can captivate them for 10+ minutes and often times we turn just the music on before we lay them down in their cribs to sleep which helps lull them (otherwise they may stare at the visuals too long and not go to sleep).
__label__pos	But for keeping them awake and entertained these are great.
__label__neg	My biggest complaint about them though is how they attach to the crib.
__label__neg	Those straps are soooo annoying!
__label__neg	I hate them which is why I only gave this product 4 stars and debated giving it only 3.
__label__neu	I wanted to use one of these soothers sometimes on the crib but also sometimes in the living room since we spend so much time with the boys in there.
__label__neg	Well given what a HUGE pain they are to attach/detach from the crib that doesn't happen.
__label__neg	Plus the bottom of the soother is not flat which is another stupid thing.
__label__neg	I wanted to just set it up on the coffee table for instance when in the living room but that doesn't work because its not flat on the bottom.
__label__neg	Those two issues (the straps and the rounded bottom) are very frustrating.
__label__pos	But for just using this soother on the crib its great.
__label__neg	I dread when it needs batteries though given what a hassle it is to remove from the crib rail!
__label__pos	We like using this rocker for our baby.
__label__neu	He is on the tall size and he quickly outgrew his other rocker (Fisher Price Rainforest Rocker).
__label__pos	He likes this one a lot and it is nice that it converts to a toddler ricker when he gets a little older
__label__pos	This is one of only a few products my husband and I would buy again with no hesitation.
__label__pos	We bought it over a year ago (with the extension) and have used it every day since.
__label__pos	When my daughter outgrew the octoganal arrangement we just opened it up and have used it to block her from the kitchen and other dangerous areas.
__label__neu	She is not a climber yet so I do NOT recommend using it in this fashion if your child is.
__label__neu	It will tip over the circular formation is the sturdiest.
__label__pos	We haven't had any problems with pieces breaking off or the plastic being brittle and we adjust it almost daily.
__label__pos	Highly recommended.
__label__pos	I love this product!
__label__pos	It really cuts down on the amount of time it takes to make my baby's bottles now because I can pump directly into her bottles.
__label__pos	It also cuts down on the wasted breast milk since I pump right into what she feeds from.
__label__neu	I use this with the Medela Pump In Style Advance.
__label__neu	Make sure when you buy this product it comes with two of each of the adapter rings.
__label__neu	The old conversion set only came with one of each since ring.
__label__neu	This has two for the bottles and two for the Via nursers.
__label__pos	Love it!
__label__pos	This is a great bag!
__label__pos	It is well made and easy to use.
__label__pos	There is plenty of usable space but it doesn't feel too big.
__label__neu	The front pouch holds my stuff (keys cell phone etc) and I keep sunglasses and a water bottle in the side pockets.
__label__pos	The front pouch easily lifts up to access more flat pockets.
__label__pos	The main compartment is unzipped from the top and there is lots of room for cloths clothes and the diaper pad pouch.
__label__neu	There is also a side pouch for more storage (I put a blanket and cloths there too).
__label__neu	It easily attaches to a stroller (I have a bugaboo) and the bag itself can hook and unhook with the 2 clasps easily leaving the hooks on the stroller itself.
__label__pos	The color is nice - not too bright and my husband doesn't mind carrying the bag if he needs to.
__label__pos	The shoulder strap is padded and adjustable and comfy to carry over the shoulder.
__label__neu	Ok I have not used the new & improved version but I can tell you.
__label__pos	seek out the old version!
__label__pos	It has been great!
__label__pos	No expensive diaper genie bags to buy -- you can just use the plastic bags from the grocery store.
__label__neu	On the new version I do not see the tabs to loop the plastic bag handles over I hope that doesn't mean you can't use them anymore.
__label__pos	Also the old version seals well and does not allow odors to leak into the room.
__label__neu	Good luck!
__label__pos	The idea of the bottles is good.
__label__pos	They do help to reduce air.
__label__neg	However to me it was not worth it b/c of the problems we had with the nipples.
__label__neg	It seemed like every nipple had some sort of problem.
__label__neg	EVERY bottle I bought was a newborn bottle- with newborn nipples ( I double and triple checked) but for some reason they ALL had different flows!
__label__neg	Some would choke and gag him some didn't even work and NOTHING would come out some were okay you get the point.
__label__neg	It was always a guessing game with these bottles.
__label__neg	We had to constantly try to keep up with which nipples were the good ones and which ones didn't work.
__label__neg	And when you have a hungry fussy baby its no fun to be wasting time trying to keep up with stuff like that.
__label__neg	On top of the fact that we had 20 bottles and only 2-3 nipples that worked the way they were supposed to.
__label__neg	Another issue we had was that the nipples all colapsed!
__label__neg	It was horrible.
__label__neg	He would suck 10 times and the nipple would be colapsed.
__label__neg	I felt that these bottles were very poor quality.
__label__neu	Like I said the idea of the VentAire is good but the bottles just aren't up to my expectations.
__label__pos	This is an awesome item!
__label__pos	It helped my colicky baby sleep much better!
__label__pos	Now that she is over the colic she still loves the swaddle me blankets.
__label__pos	It works so much better than swaddling in a regular receiving blanket because she can't squirm out of it.
__label__neu	She is very fidgety and therefore wakes herself up a lot if she is not in her swaddle me blankie.
__label__neu	She wakes up several times during the night without this but when she is swaddled in her swaddle me she sleeps 8 to 10 hours and she is five months old!
__label__pos	It's a wonderful product and I don't know what we would do without it.
__label__pos	Great for both smaller (newborn) and/or larger babies.
__label__pos	The hammock only really works with small/newborn babies.
__label__neu	Tub is sturdy reversible (inclined or sitting positions) and can be mounted on some kitchen sinks.
__label__neu	My son grew out of his newborn tub REALLY fast (3- months- old) so I bought this as a replacement because it was the only one I could find that was big enough for him to bathe in comfortably (and he was still not ready for the adult tub).
__label__pos	Then after a couple more months he really enjoyed being able to sit up (when he was able) instead of being reclined the whole time which made bath- time a LOT easier.
__label__pos	The two different sides (reclining/sitting) really extend the life of this tub and it is an excellent value.
__label__neu	I own an Infantino front pack and baby sling and found my  6 week old didn't really like either much but she will fall asleep in this and allows me to actually switch some laundry and walk to the mail box.
__label__pos	Also great for bad backs as it really distributes the weight.
__label__neg	Only negative is it is a lot of fabric and I really heat up quick in moderate weather.
__label__pos	Super soft fabric.
__label__neu	I was originally looking at buying a potty chair that had all the bells and whistles flush noises music lights the works.
__label__neu	Then I thought wait a minute the regular potty doesn't have those things.
__label__neu	She wants one like mommies!
__label__neu	I got this for her after being asked repeatedly to read the potty book for girls She was immediately  sitting on it without any prompting.
__label__neu	Once I finally took her pants off she went right away.
__label__pos	We are still working on going always on the potty but she loves the potty itself.
__label__neu	It is very basic and sturdy.
__label__pos	My daughter had no problem sitting with the little guard on the front.
__label__pos	I like that it has a separate bowl and my daughter is so proud when she can take it out and flush it down the big potty.
__label__pos	The champ is great because you don't have to waste anymore money buying expensive refills like the diaper genie.
__label__neu	This one uses regular bags (I use 32 gallon bags).
__label__neu	I did have some problems with the odor but I think anything you put poop in and let sit for days will have odor so that's inevitable!
__label__neu	Here's some tricks for this Champ.1.
__label__neu	Put an Arm & Hammer Baking Soda box at the bottom of the pail to help eliminate orders.
__label__neu	And the obvious change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.
__label__neg	The side straps of the diaper will get caught in the shoot so make sure you roll the diaper really tight and use the straps to hold it together otherwise your diaper shoot will get clogged.3.
__label__neu	If you're like me you probably have tons of grocery bags laying around.
__label__neu	Keep a few handy in the nursery and use them to bag the poopy diapers.
__label__neu	Double bagging them helps to eliminate the orders.
__label__neu	Hope this helps!
__label__pos	These bibs fit on my Baby Bjorn great.
__label__neu	I wish they were a little thicker but they do the job.
__label__pos	My Child loved this from birth--- Freddie was attached to the my child's cart/bed in the hospital.
__label__neu	On the opposite side of the colors is black and white which at birth made him focus on an object.
__label__pos	This is still his favorite toy at 4 months of age.
__label__pos	We just love Freddie and this is his only toy so far that if it was lost I would buy another really quick!
__label__neg	Both of my daughters slid right down the positioner.
__label__neg	So I stopped using it right away.
__label__neg	I do not recommend this product at all.
__label__neu	Ditto to all the other reviews that say the gate is extremely difficult to install but it's worth it once it's in place -- it works very well
__label__neg	I have the older model - Hope what they say about the newer model isn't true.
__label__neu	This was the first toy my daughter actually noticed - and it happened very early.
__label__pos	She is now 5 months old and still loves it.
__label__pos	Everyone says that all car seats are the same I think this one is worth the extra money.
__label__neu	My second child is in this one and my first is in his original Cosco one.
__label__neu	The Cosco is adequate but the Britax is 1.
__label__pos	easier to install 2.
__label__pos	easier to put straps on and 3.
__label__neu	probably the most irritating thing about the Cosco is trying to adjust the straps and tighten them and Britax is a piece of cake.
__label__neu	I have had so many less frustrations with the Britax and it even has little velcro spots to put the straps on when you are not using them so that when you put your child in you are not mussing about trying to find the straps from underneath them.
__label__pos	Great car seat!
__label__neu	I love this travel swing for serving it's purpose but as far as it's portability that left me with some gripes.
__label__neg	When the swing is folded flat the legs do not lock into place so they swing out as you are walking or trying to lay it flat in your car.
__label__neg	Also when I'm traveling with this swing I need to set it down to put the baby down and open the car door but there are no wide steady feet to set it down on you just have to let it collapse on the floor.
__label__neu	So you see love the swing wouldn't live w/out one of these but fisher price could have easily perfected this one and had the market for a few dollars more.
__label__pos	If you have ever been somewhere with your child and didn't want to lug your entire diaper bag into a public bathroom stall this is the product for you!
__label__pos	No more deciding where to put your diaper bag (or having to place it on a nasty floor - yuck!).
__label__neu	The pronto holds all your diaper essentials so you can leave your bag and just bring the bare essentials into the changing area.
__label__pos	This is the perfect gift for new mommies It even has a lanyard so you dont have to carry it around or have to wear a belt.
__label__pos	It has such clarity and a great range.
__label__pos	I love it
__label__neu	This is not just for pregnant women.
__label__pos	It works great for arthritics too.
__label__neg	I'm only 51 and already have very bad arthritis pain in my knees hips foot and sometimes back.
__label__pos	I love sleeping with this body pillow.
__label__neu	It helps me sleep on my back better (I WAS a stomach sleeper) and longer.
__label__pos	I am short and this cuts in at the bottom in just the right place to elevate my legs just enough.
__label__neu	For side sleeping it keeps my knees from having to touch which causes great pain quickly.
__label__pos	This pillow also helps keep me snuggly and warm which helps my arthritis too.
__label__neu	When I just want to rest or read a book it can be folded to prop me up at just the right angle.
__label__pos	It would be perfect for bedtime TV watching too.
__label__neg	The down side is the inside curve of the head part of the pillow.
__label__neg	It should have been made with elastic and shirring.
__label__neg	It tends to cut tightly across my shoulder at times.
__label__neu	I have to readjust my position to avoid that.
__label__neu	Also this seems to be molded more for short people.
__label__pos	At 5'2 it's just perfect for me.
__label__neu	But I don't know if it would be as helpful for a taller person.
__label__neu	I'm going to try some of the other suggestions of turning the pillow around and using my own pillow for my head and see how that works.
__label__neu	Moms are always looking for something that will keep snacks from getting thrown everywhere.
__label__neg	This pretty much isn't the solution.
__label__neg	My son (11 months) can easily reach in with his whole fist and grab a handfull of snacks and subsequently scatter them everywhere.
__label__pos	He does enjoy chewing on the lid though so I guess there's that.
__label__pos	I used this carrier from the time my baby was 3 weeks and still use it now that she is seven months.
__label__pos	We love this.
__label__neu	Although it is a bit slow (about 15 minutes) it is very valuable when traveling.
__label__pos	We bought this when on a roadtrip and have had no regrets.
__label__pos	This is an excellent product.
__label__pos	My husband who had never held a baby before we had our daughter was able to swaddle our little girl like a pro using this product.
__label__pos	Even my mom who use to work Labor and Delivery as a nurse loves this product.
__label__pos	I loved it because I didn't worry about her getting her blanket loose and then getting it over her face.
__label__pos	She stayed snug in this blanket whenever she slept.
__label__neu	I had bought this right before we moved 1/2 ways across the world.
__label__pos	It was perfect.
__label__neu	We were able to fit out Chicco Keyfit and teh Graco Turbo booster in this bag.
__label__neu	It turned out that we needed an extra bag so I took the carseat out and replaced it with the First Years reclining booster seat (for eating) a boppy and some clothes and had a ton of room.
__label__pos	For the price it did exactly what it was supposed to do.
__label__neg	The only thing that would make this product better is to have wheels and a handle.
__label__neu	We have the boppy changing pad cover and these liners.
__label__pos	I LOVE that I can just throw these in the wash instead of having to take off the whole cover.
__label__neu	It means I only have to own one full cover.
__label__neu	I wash them in warm water and dry them on low or medium heat in the dryer.
__label__pos	I haven't had any issues with rolling wrinkling etc
__label__pos	I LOVED this jumper.
__label__neu	Our floorplan is very open so we don't have doorways in which to hang a jumper.
__label__pos	Also that idea has always made me very antsy so the idea of a free- standing jumper made me feel much safer.
__label__pos	I love the 5 height adjustments the washable pad and removable front toys.
__label__pos	I love that almost every piece can be easily washed and the others just take a little more time.
__label__neg	The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is the amount of space it takes up.
__label__neg	It is very wide and even when folded requires quite a bit of space.
__label__neu	It does make some noise when your baby jumps but nothing unbearable.
__label__pos	All in all I loved this product and so did both of our boys!
__label__neu	I got 4 of these for my 2 girls.
__label__neu	I put one on their cups and one on their snack bowl.
__label__neu	My girls are 3 and 14 months and neither one of them have taken this off after the first time.
__label__neg	My 14 month old doesn't like it very much because it annoys her.
__label__neg	I'm not sure why but she doesn't mind it on her snack bowl just her cup.
__label__pos	I like them though.
__label__neu	I got them for the car so I don't have to reach back and get their cups every 5 minutes.
__label__pos	So far it's working they throw the cup or bowl and then just use the strap to pull it back.
__label__neg	One thing I don't like it my 3 year old's carseat doesn't have anywhere really to attach the strap but we make do.
__label__neu	I bought one of these and one of another brand and put one in each car.
__label__neg	The other one worked great but the bar at the bottom of this one warped in the sun within the first week.
__label__neg	It simply wasn't worth anything since the other brand cost about the same and was more durable.
__label__pos	This is a nice paci for babies who are outgrowing the regular soothie pacifier.
__label__neu	It is pretty big but made out of the same materials and the nipple is the same as the regular soothies.
__label__pos	My baby sucked on it more than he chewed on it but at least he wasn't able to shove the whole thing in his mouth like his old ones.
__label__pos	my daughter loves this for the past four months (she is 9 months now).
__label__pos	Still will play with it.
__label__neg	Only reason i didn't give it a five star was that the food cup in the bug comes off way too easily.
__label__pos	These are great for teething babies especially if you put fruit in them and pop them in the freezer for a few hours.
__label__neg	A few reviewers have complained that they are hard to clean.
__label__neg	The only thing I had a hard time cleaning out of them was banana.
__label__neu	Generally I turned the little bag part inside out and put them in the top rack of my dishwasher.
__label__neu	If you clean them out right away you have less of a problem.
__label__pos	They are also good for just holding a plain old ice cube when baby is teething.
__label__pos	These are a great shower gift.
__label__pos	ALL bottles nipples containers jars teethers small toys fit in this.
__label__pos	Does not take much space.
__label__neg	I was very very leery of jumpers.
__label__neg	Terrified infact.
__label__neu	However my son was jumping so much in his saucer that I figured I'd give it a go.
__label__pos	I am so happy I did.
__label__pos	It really does seem very well constructed and my son LOVES it!
__label__pos	He is so very funny in it.
__label__pos	He is eight months old and I wish I had tried it sooner.
__label__pos	He actually sleeps better since we bought it.
__label__neg	I still have to say I don't trust it and I am supervising very closely when he is in it.
__label__neg	I am just scared of the thing coming down on top of him because it is so heavy.
__label__pos	I practically hung on it myself with full body weight though and it didn't budge so I do think it is safe.
__label__neu	I do have an old victorian with very big doorway molding though so I don't know about newer homes with small molding.
__label__pos	We love this gate!
__label__neu	We purchased two one for the top of the stairs and one for downstairs.
__label__pos	Let me tell you a few reasons why this will be the only baby gate we will buy.1.
__label__pos	You can take the gate part off when not needed yet it is safe enough for the top of the stairs.2.
__label__neu	Even 5 year olds still cannot open it.
__label__neu	All other baby gates become useless as soon as the kids figure out how it works.3.
__label__neu	You can buy extra sets of hardware to move the gate around depending on the circumstances.4.
__label__pos	It's so cheap!
__label__pos	These are just the top few reasons why we love this gate.
__label__neu	Give it a try.
__label__pos	This gate is great the walls are like a pack n play.
__label__neg	I just wish it fit smaller openings also.
__label__neu	This actually came with my boppy and I actually had a few similar already made by other companies.
__label__pos	I went with this one.
__label__pos	The little extra donut can be removed once baby gets a little bigger its soft easy to use and I just liked it better than the ones I've used.
__label__neu	I wouln't use something like this in the crib though but carseat or playtime is perfect.
__label__pos	The Ergo baby carrier saves your back and supports more weight over the long run.
__label__pos	It also seems like a more natural sitting position for a baby especially boys.
__label__neu	Ergo Baby Carrier Black with Camel Lining
__label__neu	This is just a few wooden discs tied via a rubber band.
__label__neg	I was very skeptical at first.
__label__pos	It actually works.
__label__pos	My daughter is glued to it.
__label__neu	When you play catch; it does make clicking sound.
__label__pos	She likes to grab it and play with it for long times.
__label__neu	I hope it is made of good quality paint as she chews a lot too.
__label__neu	Count less hours of fun and price less smiles.
__label__neg	These sheets are so itchy it is unbelievable.
__label__neg	I have a hard time putting these against my skin so it pains me knowing that my precious little one with his sensitive skin is sleeping on these.
__label__pos	I love the concept the ease of use and the fact that they fit like a glove.
__label__neu	They are genius I just wish that the fabric wasn't so itchy!
__label__neu	I am hoping that with a few more washes they will become softer otherwise I would have given them a 5 star review.
__label__pos	Works well for flat or inverted nipples.
__label__neu	I use the Skip Hop pacifier pod to keep it clean and free of lint in my bag.
__label__neg	The main problem is with the flimsy and thin velcro that attaches the holder to the stroller won't keep anything upright so any liquid you put in the holder will spill.
__label__neu	I received this gym at my baby shower so my baby (who is 7 months old now) has been playing with it for awhile now.
__label__pos	He really likes it and it has been something he has played with in a lot of different ways as he has developed.
__label__neu	He started out laying on his back and just watching the lights.
__label__pos	It was also good for tummy time (which he tended to hate in general) because it gave him something to look at as he laid on his stomach.
__label__neu	Now he sits up and plays with the toys that hang from the gym.
__label__neu	He also uses the bars to support himself as he practices standing up (with me sitting right behind him in case he decides to let go).
__label__neg	The one negative about it is that the music is really fast it's the typical cute baby songs (Animal Fair Pop Goes the Weasel etc but at warp speed which is a little weird.
__label__pos	Other than that I love it and so does my baby!
__label__pos	I am so glad that I recieved a Boppy as a shower gift.
__label__pos	I had heard that they were great but I never could have imagined how crucial it would be to me.
__label__neu	Yeah the Boppy's not as firm as it was in the beginning but I wouldn't describe it as lumpy or saggy - it has the same shape and support it's just a little smushed but babies get bigger with time and those big hineys take a toll on the Boppy's stuffing!
__label__neu	Ha!
__label__pos	Definitely buy a cover (or two) - they wash up nicely.
__label__pos	Buy a Boppy - you'll be glad you did!
__label__neu	I worked in a hospital and we use to use these as burp rags.
__label__pos	They are absorbant and big enough to use.
__label__pos	Saves babies clothing from stains and wetness.
__label__pos	This is a great sterilizer and is so easy to use.
__label__neu	It can also double as a place to store your bottles.
__label__neg	I and my baby hated the bottles that come with it though.
__label__neg	They leak and are awkward to hold.
__label__pos	this is a great washing tool for baby.
__label__pos	i wouldn't dream of using anything else.
__label__neu	since the umbilical cord fell off my baby has been using this in our adult bathtub.
__label__pos	he doesn't slip and is comfortable lying on this.
__label__pos	he enjoys feeling like hes taking a bath even though the water level doesn't come past the point of the mat.
__label__pos	this is probably good up until baby can sit up and move around on their own
__label__pos	My daughter is now 2 weeks old and actually loves this chair.
__label__pos	The headpiece needed a little adjustment but she doesn't slide in the chair and I feel really safe about letting her stay in it.
__label__pos	Also the backsupport seems to be really good for her.
__label__pos	During her first week she was really fussy and this chair calmed her down almost every time now she even sleeps in it for 2-3 hours.
__label__pos	This is a great gift and truly a life- saver.
__label__pos	If you need a shower gift this is it!
__label__pos	I got one and I love it the Gerber products smell sooo good and are gentle enough for everyday bathing!
__label__pos	Mt daughter loves to coo at the seal and loves the music cd that comes along with it.
__label__pos	I keep all of the out grown small bottles in the container and it works great~!
__label__neu	The lotion is good smelling but you can't beat Johnsons and johnstons pink stuff also include a bottle of that and you will havev a very happy mom- to be!
__label__pos	I love this bouncer!
__label__pos	My six week old loves it too.
__label__pos	She enjoys the soft music bubbles vibration and fish.
__label__pos	She loves to nap and play with her bouncer.
__label__neu	I can get a lot of things done around the house and actually watch a little TV.
__label__pos	It also helps with her colic because of the vibration.
__label__pos	Our baby has really liked this bath.
__label__neg	Now that she's sitting up its starting to get pretty messy though.
__label__pos	The bath fits well and is small enough to store easily.
__label__neg	The one big problem is the temperature sensitive plug.
__label__neu	I filled the bath with very hot water to clean it out and the plug slowly changed color.
__label__neg	I would not trust it at all.
__label__neu	So if you ignore that feature it's a great design.
__label__pos	This locks are the best.
__label__pos	I bought different kinds and only liked this ones they are sooo easy to instal and the tape is really hard although I did screw one side just in case.
__label__neu	My 1 year old tries and tries until he gives up.
__label__pos	Great product!
__label__neu	I wish they would do one for cabinets!
__label__neu	this ones only fit in doors!
__label__pos	I did a TON of research on car seats when my daughter started out growing her Graco ComfortSport Convertible CarSeat and found the Graco Nautilus to be one of the safest most comfortable affordable highest rated by consumers.
__label__neu	Pros.
__label__pos	Safe Safe Safe!
__label__pos	Extensively Crash TestedReinforced SteelEasy to cleanEasy to adjustMost cushy seat of booster/car seats.
__label__pos	Fits 20-100lbs so you wont have to purchase another seat after this one!
__label__neu	Cons.
__label__neg	Not as wide as the ComfortSportDoes not have EPS energy absorbing foamDoes not have GracoPedic luxury foam cushioned seatThe crotch buckle doesn't have enough slots for adjusting
__label__pos	This pad can be used for anything!
__label__neu	I use one under my sheets in the area my son likes to spit up on under him during &quot;let's give that touschi some air&quot; time and as a take along for diaper changes no one's going to tell you but they secretly don't want you to change your baby on their bed or sofa!
__label__neu	Go figure.
__label__neu	Also unlike their cousin the 'Quilted Crib Mattress Pad' it doesn't pill up enough to care.
__label__pos	This is great.
__label__neu	We have it for our 7 month old son who was crawling all over the place.
__label__pos	He loves to hang out in here and play.
__label__pos	He doesn't hurt himself and if you add a foam playmat under it it's even safer.
__label__pos	It's nice to have insetead of a playard because you can sit in there with the kid and hang out with him.
__label__neu	It gives him alot of room to play and crawl.
__label__neu	He can stand up and hold on to the sides.
__label__neu	He even stood by himself!
__label__pos	The other cool thing is that all the toys are in one spot!
__label__neu	We have two baskets of toys in there for him to play with.
__label__pos	This is portable and light.
__label__neu	It's kind of a pain to reshape;(which is why it got 4 stars) but once you have it together it's pretty sturdy.
__label__pos	It's also indoor- outdoor which is great for people with backyards decks or pools.
__label__pos	Folds up very compactly.
__label__pos	You could easily store this in a closet when not in use.
__label__pos	Overall it's a great product to have and well worth the money.
__label__pos	I highly recommend it.
__label__neu	You save a lot of money when you buy this in bulk rather than buying them individually.
__label__neu	There has been a new toy that fits my daughter's development from 2 weeks to 6 months.
__label__pos	She had enjoyed each toy so far!
__label__neu	Despite the concerns about BPA we are using these bottles for our daughter and using canned formula to supplement breastfeeding.
__label__neu	The concern with BPA seems to be heightened when the bottles are washed with hot water or sterilized at hot temperatures.
__label__neu	We bought this sterilizer but have stopped using it.
__label__pos	However we still use the dishwasher which is fairly hot.
__label__neu	I am keeping an eye on Avent's statements.
__label__pos	We keep using them because they seem to be really excellent bottles and nipples she feeds easily and doesn't get a whole lot of gas.
__label__pos	The nipples are designed so that you can graduate her to faster flow nipples as she gets bigger.
__label__neu	We are hoping that the BPA concerns will turn out to be unwarranted.
__label__neu	The sterilizer was given to me as a shower gift.
__label__neg	I used it for a few days until I realized it was so much easier to use my dishwasher.
__label__neu	My dishwasher can wash / hold more bottles than the sterilizer.
__label__neg	You have to be careful when removing it from the microwave it's extremely hot and can cause serious burns.
__label__neu	For those with a dishwasher stick with the dishwasher.
__label__pos	However if you don't have a dishwasher this is pretty nifty for the price.
__label__pos	This toy is very nice with great colors textures and a nice clicking noise.
__label__pos	Good for little one's who can crawl after it.
__label__pos	It works fine.
__label__neu	The gel gets super cold but the covering is very soft.
__label__neu	My 15 month old can hold on to it without getting cold hands.
__label__neu	Summary.
__label__pos	Works great for collecting leaked breastmilk and thereby minimizing waste; ventilated shells are great relief for injured nipples; appearance drastically improves if worn with a lightly padded braProduct comes with two soft bases (rings fitting around nipple) and two sets of covers.
__label__neu	one ventilated (with holes) and one without holes.
__label__neu	Pros.
__label__pos	ventilated shells protect irritated or damaged nipples from contact with clothing reducing irritation and allowing healing without blocking air from the skin- ventilated shells can collect a couple ounces of milk (if you're mindful of the holes at the top)- solid (no hole) shells can collect 2-3 ounces of milk and have convenient pouring spouts- base is shaped pointing out which is desirable for flat nipplesCons.
__label__neu	soft base (ring with hole for the nipple to fit through) can cause skin irritation if left on too long due to moisture accumulation- outward appearance through clothing varies greatly depending on breast size and type of bra used; seems to be designed to contour with size C at most
__label__neu	We got this so that we could hear baby as she slept in her nursey and we worked elsewhere in the house and becasue we have always had wonderful expereince with everything Sony makes.
__label__neg	This one however was a dud.
__label__neg	I could still hear baby without the monitor when the monitor was beeping because it didn't get signal.
__label__neg	I was really really disappointed especially since it was a shower gift I had registered for from someone who splurged to get it for us!
__label__neg	I thought this would be a great idea.
__label__neu	So when we found out we were having twins i ran out and bought 2 of them.
__label__neg	We started to put the nurserys together and when it came time to put these on they wouldnt fit.
__label__neu	I didnt want to stratch the crib rails up so we took them back.
__label__neg	When we did try to play a cd in them it skipped.
__label__neu	We ended up just buying small cd/radio players for each of their room because this is something they can both use for a long time.
__label__neu	I had this pump with my first baby born 2 years ago.
__label__neg	I thought that it would be a better deal than Avent and boy was I wrong.
__label__neg	I got it home and cleaned it and started using it and it made my already sore breasts hurt even more (cracking and bleeding) and made my problems even worse.
__label__neu	The first time I used it came apart during use.
__label__neu	And the 5 times I used it after that too.
__label__neg	I called customer service and the lady was extremely rude to me interupting me while I was trying to explain my problem to her and all she did was explain how to put it back together.
__label__neg	I took it to my lactation consultant and she said that she hates that brand/model and that she had 5 other mothers have the same complaints about it.
__label__neu	The store I bought it from has since stopped stocking this model.
__label__neg	Yeah it has a design similar to Avent but trust me there is a reason why this product only costs $20 its junk.
__label__neu	The breast funnel is hard plastic and very uncomfortable might as well use a kitchen funnel This time I went with a hospital grade pump Playtex Embrace and I love it
__label__pos	This is a must have for all moms and dads.
__label__neu	I have used everything in this little kit so far except for the dropper.
__label__neu	I keep it in my diaper bag at all times!
__label__neu	I wasn't sure at first if this would be worth the money but let me tell you.
__label__neu	IT IS.
__label__neg	I was used to the screaming struggle to clear my son's nose with the dreaded bulb syringe.
__label__neu	When I first used this on him he gave me a puzzled look and then laughed.
__label__pos	I was amazed.
__label__neu	I promptly threw away the awful bulb and haven't looked back.
__label__pos	The songs it plays actually are a good distraction although I haven't needed to distract him because it's not unpleasant to suction his nose anymore!
__label__pos	This toy is very great!
__label__pos	Even my 4mo son was very interested in it.
__label__pos	He doesn't know how to play with such toys but he is always happy to see his train and likes when I show it to him.
__label__neu	There are no sharp corners.
__label__pos	Plastic is very good.
__label__pos	It fall down from a high chair so many times and its fine!
__label__neu	Now my son is 5 months and in his playpen he tries to reach his train.
__label__neu	This train makes a rattle sound when his wheels are moving.
__label__pos	From just a couple of weeks old we used this toy to distract her if she was having a meltdown (of course she couldn't hold it then) and she still loves this toy!
__label__neu	Now she can throw it around and squish the flowers.
__label__pos	The lights and music did a great job calming my baby and still does!
__label__pos	Well worth the money.
__label__pos	This little guy is great.
__label__neu	There is so much for my little one to do.
__label__neu	Although she mostly likes to make the scrunchy noise and chew on the squeak bubble.
__label__pos	It's ALL GOOD!
__label__neu	I'm a father of two one is currently swaddled in this.
__label__neu	She sleeps in this.
__label__pos	No crying!
__label__neu	Buy a few as your wife will want to wash it when the infant spits throws up etc
__label__pos	Ok so the idea of the Diaper Champ is awesome-- it is very easy to use-- that's why I gave it 1 star.
__label__neg	However the thing REALLY stinks!
__label__pos	Someone gave me the Neat diaper disposal system for my baby shower & I absolutely loved it.
__label__neu	However the handle broke on it just 2 weeks ago.
__label__neg	I thoughtMaybe I could try the Diaper Champ since I won't have to purchase any liners Well that was a HUGE mistake!
__label__neu	I see why this thing got 4 stars-- all of these parents have young children!
__label__neu	My daughter is 14 months old & because she is older I guess her diapers come with more odor!
__label__neg	After literally only a few diapers her entire room smelled of poop!
__label__neu	I couldn't stand it!
__label__neu	In one week I changed the garbage bag at least 4 times.
__label__neu	Is that really saving money??
__label__neu	I don't think so!
__label__neg	Plus her room really smelled bad.
__label__neu	I'm taking it back & getting the Neat again!
__label__neu	The Diaper Champ must be great for infants but you may want to consider something else for older babies!
__label__pos	This thermometer is the answer to one of a new mom's greatest fears.
__label__neg	too hot bath water.
__label__pos	And it is oh so cute as well!
__label__neu	The thermometer beeps continually if the temperature of the water leaves the appropiate temperature range-- too hot or too cold.
__label__pos	It's great how fast it registers the temperature after it is placed in the water.
__label__neu	It turns itself on when in water and off when out of water.
__label__pos	Baby loves to play with it.
__label__neu	Just have to make sure it is returned to upright position if baby tips it upside down.
__label__pos	Simply a lovely bath safety tool.
__label__neu	This fit perfectly on the crib mattress out of the bag but when I washed it it shrunk a good inch or two.
__label__neu	The size still works but still the manufacturer might want to take shrinking into account when they cut the original prewashed size of the item.
__label__neu	OR sell it prewashed and shrunk if they're worried people will pull it out of the bag and think it's too big before they've washed it.
__label__pos	Thank God for this high chair.
__label__pos	I LOVE it.
__label__pos	It fits perfectly on my kitchen chair takes no extra room.
__label__pos	It's really cute not ugly or ridiculous looking.
__label__pos	It was easy to install.
__label__pos	It's comfy easy to clean.
__label__pos	My 5 month old really likes it too.
__label__pos	It reclines and just is wonderful.
__label__pos	My only regret is that I didn't get it sooner than I did.
__label__neu	I could have used this a long time ago.
__label__neu	edit).
__label__pos	My son is now 14 months old and I still absolutely love this high chair!
__label__pos	He's 30 lbs and still fits nicely in it it's still easy to clean and we use it every day.
__label__neu	It easily slides up to the table and we use it with the tray and at times without so he can sit at the table with us.
__label__pos	No regrets!
__label__neu	I wanted a snap- n- go type stroller for our Chicco Keyfit carseat.
__label__pos	This worked perfectly.
__label__pos	I found the stroller to be well- made and easy to steer.
__label__pos	It was easy to open one- handed (while holding a baby or carseat) and has a spacious basket that was pretty easy to access even if baby was in the stroller.
__label__pos	We were very happy with this stroller and glad to find one that worked well with the Chicco Keyfit.
__label__pos	This swing has so much more than I expected!
__label__pos	It was very easy to put together and is so multi- functional.
__label__pos	Definitely worth the money!
__label__pos	I especially love that I can plug it in instead of being stuck having to buy batteries every week like most all other swings.
__label__neu	There are so many different sound options to play and when you have it on silent mode there is no sound at all its totally quiet unlike most swings that still make a motor noise.
__label__pos	And I love that you can play the music or sounds without having the swing turned on.
__label__pos	Altogether this swing has no drawbacks or fine print.
__label__pos	Our daughter loves this playmat!
__label__neu	She likes the different animals and enjoys talking to the baby in the mirror.
__label__pos	The toys easily remove so you can also attach them to a carseat or crib.
__label__neu	She seems to also enjoy the musical star but I find it to be a bit annoying.
__label__neg	I wish that it played a few more songs.
__label__neg	I have also noticed that the colors on the mat have faded a bit in the wash even though we use a mild detergent and have a front- loading machine.
__label__pos	I don't mind too much since our daughter has so much fun and that's what really matters!
__label__pos	They are great to wear at home either at night or on weekends.
__label__neg	They do not form with the breast and make your breast look weird when worn.
__label__neu	ALTERNATIVE USE.
__label__neu	I use them when pumping.
__label__neu	When I pump one breast at a time I put the shell to the breast that is not being pumped.
__label__neu	Since it leaks I collect the milk and don't waste it at all!
__label__neg	I liked every thing about these except I wish they were just a little bit bigger when I take them off my daughter she has red welt like marks where they were
__label__pos	This is a great carrier once you figure it out.
__label__neu	My husband and I had to take a few minutes to get it down but after the first two or three times using it I didn't have to use the directions anymore.
__label__pos	For a newborn it is awesome - other carriers can feel awkward but this carrier adjusts to the size.
__label__neg	The drawbacks - this is made of a t- shirt- like material so as you wear it the material stretches and the baby tends to slide down.
__label__neg	Also it is sufficiently complicated that you can't put it on while you hold the baby.
__label__neu	I found that life was made easier if I put it on before I left my house and then when I got out of the car where I was going I could put the baby in.
__label__pos	It is comfortable enough to wear without the baby in too so you can put it on once for the day even if you put the baby in and out.
__label__neu	I love my Britax stroller but was lost without a drink/ wallet holder on top.
__label__pos	This thing fits easily works perfectly.
__label__neu	It has a drink holder on each side and a small zipper/ mesh compartment for a few dollars in the middle open area.
__label__pos	The canvas seems to wash up well.
__label__pos	Very durable and practical.
__label__neu	Our handle for our stroller flips down to bring the stroller up to you when sitting.
__label__neu	This flips over the handle to hang on the handle in both positions.
__label__neu	I would recommend also purchasing a similar thing for baby when he/she is older if you have the Britax stroller (or similar).
__label__neu	I like the tasteful simple black but would have preferred some color/ pattern options.
__label__neu	Or maybe even a more intricate picture on one side for the baby to stare at just a thought .
__label__pos	My baby really enjoys this and can stay in it for quite some time entertaining herself.
__label__neg	My only complaint is that the butterflies seem pretty useless.
__label__neu	I bought this mirror because of all the great reviews.
__label__neg	But I am not thrilled with it.
__label__neg	I have to see if I can find anything that works better for me.
__label__neg	Maybe all the car seat mirrors are problematic.
__label__neu	Who knows.
__label__neu	The view in this is very clear though small.
__label__neg	The bigger downside though is that I have it attached for the middle seat in my mid- sized sedan and as a couple other reviewers point out it completely blocks the visibility of the car behind you.
__label__neu	It actually spans the distance from the top of the seat to the roof of the car splitting the rear window visibility in half.
__label__neg	I thought I might be able to live with this but I can not.
__label__neu	I can't see the car directly behind me on the highway at all.
__label__neu	I can't see if they are real close or far away or not there at all.
__label__pos	I like to be able to see behind me because it helps me gauge my reaction in an emergency situation.
__label__neu	So I'm going to look on
__label__neu	This is one of those products that can be terrific for some people and bad for others.
__label__neu	My daughter didn't do well with it at all.
__label__neg	It fit awkwardly and she kept leaning and falling while using it much more than without it.
__label__neg	It got to the point where I felt that it was dangerous to keep trying so I got rid of it.
__label__neu	If you have any way of trying before buying I'd suggest doing so-- maybe borrow one from a friend to see if your child takes to it.
__label__neg	Do not waste your money on the Diaper Genie.
__label__neg	Even the new and improved Diaper Genie can't compare to the Diaper Champ.
__label__neu	The Diaper Champ uses regular size trash bags where the Diaper Genie requires special refills.
__label__neg	I can't speak for anyone else but personally the idea of having to constantly buy expensive refills for my diaper pail when we already have trash bags in the house is nuts.
__label__neg	As for the smell issue.
__label__neu	Let's face it - diapers stink.
__label__neu	And regardless of brand ANY diaper pail still needs to be emptied on a regular basis.
__label__neg	As for the Diaper Genie vs the Diaper Champ I have seen no difference in odor control between the two brands - both work pretty well to contain and control odor better than a regular trash barrel but neither are odor proof.
__label__pos	Love the new style of bottles.
__label__pos	The old style are good too Good to know before buying.
__label__neu	before 2009 Medela baby bottles took the old style skinny base nipples.
__label__neu	The nipples with the correct Collar will fit * ANY* Medila bottle.
__label__neu	(**** You just have to have to correct collar/ nipple combination* ***) the yellow lids also only fit the old style nipples and collars.
__label__neu	** AGAIN- These collars on these bottles WILL fit ANY Midela bottle Assuming you match the right nipple with the right collar.
__label__pos	Our son loves this play mat and plays with it almost every day.
__label__neu	The toys that it comes with are fine though I was glad I had extra rings to dangle them down further as they really were up to high.
__label__neg	the picture of a rabbit is kind of a dumb toy he doesn't show any interest in it at all.
__label__pos	The musical blinking star is fun and once he learned that he could start it by pulling a toy hard enough he played it all the time.
__label__neg	One note because the supports don't cross the way some others do he has been able to hook his legs around a support and fold himself up inside the mat - it didn't hurt or even scare him but it would be a risk if he'd been unsupervised.
__label__pos	Once he started sitting up he still likes laying down and playing in it as well as sitting on the mat and playing with the toys.
__label__neu	We never used the prop pillow.
__label__pos	The PISA is an amazing pump and the cost is equal to a few months of formula so my pump has already paid for itself (used for 6 months and still going strong)!
__label__pos	I've tried generic immitations and they just don't compare.
__label__neu	Invest your money in the real thing it's worth it!
__label__pos	These bottles worked great for us.
__label__pos	We started out with the Avent bottlesand our baby developed colic for about two weeks- switching to Dr. Brown's bottles really helped.
__label__pos	The colic stopped within the week and we have notlooked back.
__label__neg	The only negative thing thatwe have experienced with these bottles has been that theyhave leaked at times.
__label__neu	As long as you are careful how you place the top filtration piece- it should be fine.
__label__neg	I purchased the Storkcraft furnature for my daugher's room after over a year of use I am really disappointed in this furnature.
__label__neg	The finsh scratches really easily the drawer gliders are coming apart this is just very cheaply made.
__label__neg	I wish I would have purchased something else.
__label__pos	My son is just completely in love with this toy!
__label__pos	I set up a playdate with a friend of mine and she let my son use her jumperoo He fell in love He was jumping up and down and shaking the toy!
__label__pos	He was laughing and laughing and that's why I just had to go out and buy one for him.
__label__pos	I totally recommend this toy.
__label__pos	Very very helpful little device especially in the middle of the night and when parents are on the run and trading off baby duties
__label__pos	I love these and the Sleepsacks.
__label__pos	Every parent should have them.
__label__pos	They make swaddling you child so much easier than using a blanket and the material is super soft.
__label__pos	I highly recommend these and Sleepsacks for when they are older.
__label__neg	I had a Safety 1st potty that I just hated before I bought this Baby Bjorn potty.
__label__neg	It leaked, its round opening was WAY too small, and I had a ton of problems with my son leaking all over the front and on to the floor.
__label__neu	Plus it came apart in many pieces and had lots of spots bacteria could hide.
__label__pos	The Baby Bjorn takes care of all the problems I had with the Safety 1st potty.
__label__pos	The simple construction is so sanitary and easy to clean.
__label__neu	There are no little places for bacteria to collect.
__label__neu	The opening is bigger than other potty chairs and oblong instead of round, so no more pooping on the seat.
__label__neu	This alone would have sold me on this potty.
__label__pos	The splash guard is great for boys.
__label__neu	No more peeing off the front of the potty and no flimsy detachable splash guards that flip down into the seat.
__label__pos	It has a nice rubber grip on the bottom to keep it in the same place on the floor.
__label__pos	Another plus is that it's nice looking and blends in with the rest of the bathroom.
__label__pos	I'm very happy with the quality and design of this potty and I have NO complaints!
__label__pos	I love this co-sleeper because I have a one-bedroom apartment and I prefer bedsharing to a crib.
__label__pos	The co-sleeper is great for my daughter to sleep or rest in.
__label__neu	She's always close by because I can wheel it around the apartment.
__label__pos	and it has tons of storage, which is also a huge help.
__label__pos	It's extremely portable and fits into a small bag.
__label__pos	It's easy to assemble and take apart.
__label__pos	And it has excellent safety features.
__label__neu	I'm going to keep this stored in the closet to use with any more new babies we have.
__label__pos	I wish i would have brought this to the hospital with me when i was struggling to the point of tears with nursing.
__label__pos	Now at 11 weeks old I use the Boppy to nurse everyday and night.
__label__pos	I use it so much I had to buy a second one to use upstairs in the middle of the night.
__label__pos	The covers and pillows are washable although I haven't washed the pillow yet i have washed the covers several times and they are holding up great.
__label__pos	I use this to nurse and to play because it is great to put the boppy by my knees and then the baby can see my face and it is easy to get her to smile using the boppy for support.
__label__neu	We got this water mat when my twins were very small - 3 months maybe?
__label__neu	We would prop them up in bobby pillows and put the mat in between them and they liked leaning over to feel the mat.
__label__neg	"The ""fish"" (toys) inside did not move as much as I thought - maybe we didn't have it filled up right."
__label__neu	Then, once they were sitting up on their own, we would sit them on the mat.
__label__neu	we said they were sitting in their pool.
__label__neu	and they enjoyed that.
__label__neg	Eventually, one of them punctured it and we didn't try to put a patch on it.
__label__pos	We use the floating toys in the bath tub now ;)
__label__neu	I bought this as 2nd stroller, to park and short errand for my 4 months baby.
__label__neu	Cons:Light weightGood canopy size5 point harnessRecline (thoug not alot but is comfortable for my 4 months old)Durable madeEasily clean seat fabricDoes not tip over when my diaper bag and shopping bags hand over the handle.
__label__neg	ProsSmall and uselss basket.
__label__neg	impossible to put anything in it or accesswish it will recline moreLonger handle ( I am 5 2 and on off i kick the back of the wheels.
__label__neg	NOT for tall parents!
__label__pos	)OverviewOverall I am happy with my purchase.
__label__pos	and YES i would recommend to anyone if they have shorter legs!
__label__neu	We bought this primarily because it had better reviews than the Diaper Genie when we bought it and that we don't have to buy special bags.
__label__pos	I love that you can use trash bags.
__label__neu	I haven't had a problem with the bag not being full enough.
__label__neu	For one, when the Champ is full the trash bag is a bit more then half full, but is also very heavy so you wouldn't want anymore diapers in there anyway.
__label__neg	The only problem I've found with it was when my sister-in-law put my 2 year old nieces diaper in there and the smell lingered a bit.
__label__neg	Her diapers are MUCH different then my 3 month old son though.
__label__pos	So overall I love the Diaper Champ!
__label__neg	I used my backpack like for 5 months and the seams by the zipper falling apart after like 40 uses.
__label__neu	"It never happened to me ever in my entire life though I'm complete ""backpack person"" and I never had anything else but a backpack."
__label__neg	Next time I will rather go than for a special backpack for normal backpack with all life warranty and buy changing pad for it.
__label__neu	My daughter is a vigorous nurser and we supplement with expressed breast milk while I am at work.
__label__neu	She cannot draw the milk in from these nipples and if she is hungry enough to do the extra work it takes about 40 minutes to eat 4 oz.
__label__neg	Not worth it.
__label__neu	At 2 months old our little guy was so fussy and we had tried 3 different formulas and almost every bottle.
__label__pos	Finally we tried Dr. Brown's and literally overnight our cranky little man turned into a sweet baby who slept normally and cried only when hungry or tired or poopy.
__label__neg	Before he cried all the time and we never knew why.
__label__neu	and I thought we just had to wait it out until he was four months and they say fussy babies mellow.
__label__pos	These bottles are not that hard to clean and worth the extra little effort it does take since it obviously helps with gas.
__label__pos	The liquid flows so easily and the baby does not have to suck so hard- I highly recommend even if you don't have a fussy baby because they seem to work the way a bottle should.
__label__pos	This sterilizer is so easy to use even a dad like me can use it.
__label__neu	The tray holds all types of bottles, caps, etc.
__label__pos	Best of all, the bottles are clean and sterilized in four minutes, without boiling water or running a half-full dishwasher.
__label__pos	I know, the price seems high, but this is one luxury that is truly a necessity.
__label__neu	I received this set as a gift.
__label__neu	I do agree with one of the reviewers you get some of the items in the hospital, however, we didn't get all of the items and when you're a new parent pressed for time, it's awfully convenient to have everything you need packed into one kit.
__label__neu	"The one ""add on"" that we put into the kit ourselves was a digital ear thermometer."
__label__pos	Other than that, it had everything we needed.
__label__pos	It's great for travel, and the items are well made and attractive in appearance.
__label__pos	It would make a terrific gift.
__label__pos	I LOVE my Boppy!
__label__neu	Everyone asked me, what's a Boppy.
__label__neu	I figured it was just for feeding.
__label__neg	Boy was I wrong.
__label__neu	I breast feed my daughter, so I used it right away in the hospital.
__label__neg	I also used it while in the hospital around my belly as an arm rest, since my tummy didn't work well as one any more.
__label__pos	When I got home I found laying her in it was perfect, kept her upright so I didn't have to worry about her choking on her milk after feeding, since she has acid reflux the doctor suggested keeping her upright for at least 5 minutes after feedings.
__label__pos	I have taken many good pictures of my little one as a baby, held her perfect.
__label__pos	Now that she is learning to sit up, its a perfect helper.
__label__pos	I would definetly recomend this to any new parent!
__label__neg	My baby doesn't like pacifiers at all so I was skeptical about this.
__label__pos	I was wrong, she loves it.
__label__pos	It really helps her with teething because she loves to chew on it.
__label__pos	Highly recommend it.
__label__neu	Haven't had any accidents to report on the function.
__label__pos	The fit is great and texture is great too.
__label__pos	For the most part I am very pleased with this product.
__label__pos	It cut down on the gas problems my daughter had and really I had no trouble cleaning them.
__label__neg	There was one bottle that for whatever reason leaked when I shook the bottle to mix it.
__label__neg	Seeing that it was only one bottle out of the 6 that we have, I am not too bothered by it.
__label__pos	Ultimately it's a fine product and I would recommend it.
__label__pos	These sheets are so soft, made of jersey fabric.
__label__pos	They are a little big for my cosco play yard, but they're overall good, especially for the price!
__label__neu	No special bags to buy.
__label__neu	change at least twice per week (especially in the summer) and you are good to go.
__label__neu	Remember this thing contains poop, so if it is not changed often, it will smell.
__label__neu	We have made liberal use of suction cup toys like this for our children.
__label__neu	We understand that you need to make sure that the surface is clean and smooth and that the suction cup is fully rinsed before trying to stick it down each time.
__label__neg	Even with those precautions, sometimes they stay down; sometimes they don't.
__label__neu	I bought this toy because we had something similar that I bought 8 years ago for my first child.
__label__neg	I really didn't want something with a light in it, but didn't have a choice.
__label__neu	My 6 month old will put this in his mouth while he sits at the table with us and it generally gets covered with food or drool.
__label__neg	He couldn't care less about the light, which is motion activated.
__label__neu	There is a little hole in the light-up ball that allows water (and who knows what else?)
__label__neu	inside.
__label__neg	Washing it means having to keep your finger over the hole and hope that you can rinse it fast enough.
__label__neg	If food gets inside that hole, you are out of luck.
__label__neg	I can't figure out why anyone would make a suction cup toy (presumably for use at a high chair, around food) that cannot be easily washed.
__label__pos	my 4 day old son loved this swing he slept in it for hours it was the best $165.00 i ever spent for my lil one and for my sanity.
__label__pos	I love the size of these bowls!
__label__pos	They are great to put snacks in and toss in the diaper bag.
__label__pos	They are quality plastic and last a long time.
__label__pos	I am buying more because over time you loose a few here and a few there.
__label__pos	Great to have on hand if you have toddlers.
__label__neg	I bought this diaper because of the good reviews however I found that it does nothing to keep out odors.
__label__neu	I am going to purchase the odor disks I just saw on amazon.
__label__neu	Hopefully this will help.
__label__neg	My son's room is very small and once I open the diaper pail his whole room begins to smell and its not like the pail is filled with dirty diapers when this occurs.
__label__neg	I would only have 2-3 diapers in there when it begins to smell.
__label__neg	I wish I had gone with a more expensive diaper pail because I can't take the odor.
__label__neu	I hope this helps.
__label__pos	Our son loves this bath tub!
__label__pos	He is so relaxed in it!
__label__pos	Best out there on the market!
__label__neu	I have a little girl and she started using this potty chair at a year old (early, but just to get the concept!).
__label__pos	she has loved it since day one!
__label__pos	She was entertained by the music which was a great incentive for her to stay a little longer on the potty, and when she was ready it transfers and snaps onto the &quot;big girl potty&quot; and still plays music!
__label__neu	She is now two and uses just the big potty but every now and then she still asks for this!
__label__pos	We didn't get much use out of the potty book that comes with it, but it's a cute idea.
__label__pos	All in all this was a good choice for us!
__label__pos	I bought this for my three month old son and we are really pleased with it.
__label__pos	It's fun for him to learn to sit up and it offers a new vantage point for him.
__label__pos	The toy is also very entertaining.
__label__neu	I did not have a problem with the smell like others- there was a slight smell when I opened the item, but after washing it and airing out over night, I really didn't notice an odor.
__label__pos	I would really recommend this to other parents.
__label__neg	Our baby's umbilical cord stump fell of when she was just a few days old, so we bathed her in this tub.
__label__pos	She was too tiny for her arms to fit in the arm places, but it worked perfectly because she fit snugly and securely in the place that the body is supposed to go.
__label__neu	Baby won't slip under the water because of the plastic mouldings, so you can have both hands free to wash and reach.
__label__neu	Once our baby was big enough to sit up, we put her on the other end (toddler end), and she plays and splashes, while still having the plastic molding so she can't slip back into the water.
__label__neu	She's 18 months old now and we fill the tub to the brim in the big bathtub.
__label__pos	This is a large baby tub, but it stores easily in the bathtub, cleans up very easily, and you will be able to use it for 2 years at least!
__label__pos	Well worth the extra $$.
__label__neu	My baby was breast fed for the first 2 months.
__label__neg	We used a nipple shield by Medela but as she got older the nipple shield was just not cutting it when it came to my baby being full.
__label__neg	I decided to pump but when my baby was fussy I couldn't pump every 3-4 hours like I needed to so my supply dropped.
__label__neu	I didn't buy this starter set, I bought a few 4 ounce bottles and gave my baby what milk I had pumped and formula.
__label__neu	I have now bought the 8 ounce bottles and use them also.
__label__pos	These bottles are great.
__label__pos	My baby burps right away and is never gassy.
__label__neg	With breast feeding she hardly ever burped.
__label__pos	We use the drop in liners and have had NO problems with leaks.
__label__neu	I also heat her formula up by putting hot water in a cup, putting the formula in a liner and dropping the liner into the warm water.
__label__neu	Then I mixed it up with a spoon to make sure there are no cold spots, test it and put the liner into the bottle and feed my baby.
__label__neu	You also don't have to worry about water dripping off the liner and getting on baby because of the plastic they are made of, the water does not stick to the liner.
__label__pos	When I pull the liner out you can't even tell it has been sitting in water.(. )
__label__neu	I originally bought the Munchkin formula dispenser to use while we were out and about.
__label__pos	Since then I have found that I even like to use it at home also.
__label__pos	It's so convenient to be able to pour the pre-measured amount of formula into my sons bottle.
__label__pos	So simple.
__label__pos	I also have a formula dispenser that I got at WalMart (Parent's Choice brand), and that one works well also, but doesn't hold the full 8 oz.
__label__neu	worth of formula that this one does.
__label__pos	The Munchkin formula dispenser was a great buy for sure!
__label__neu	The concept of this pitcher is to keep the mixing blades below the surface of the liquid to keep air to a minimum.
__label__neg	Unfortunately, lots of formulas float and need a lot of agitation to mix properly.
__label__neg	For these formulas, this pitcher is useless.
__label__neg	Additionally, the lid goes on secure but is not liquid tight.
__label__neg	Tip it or shake it and you'll have a mess.
__label__neu	One last item - in order to adjust the height of the mixing blade you have to take the lid off and push a rubber grommet up/down the shaft.
__label__neg	This isn't easy and of course it's wet with formula.
__label__neg	This seems like a messy or unsanitary way to have to do every time you make and pour a bottle.
__label__neu	Instead we found a liquid tight pitcher.
__label__neu	Shake the heck out of it to mix, then a few hours later the bubbles have settled.
__label__neu	If you can plan more than a bottle ahead, this might work out better for you, too.
__label__pos	This cute storage provides a useful place to store all the baby materials from the hospital and doctor's visit.
__label__pos	Lots of extra folders for additional items.
__label__neu	Don't you think those back straps will pull your shoulders forward?
__label__neu	YES they will.
__label__neg	My back started to hurt after 5 minutes walking with my 9 lbs baby!
__label__pos	I give not 1 but 2 stars because it is a good quality, strong, VERY easy to use baby carrier, BUT invest more money in it and buyBabyBj&ouml;rn Baby Carrier Synergy - BlackIt has that magic back support!
__label__neu	P. S> You have to adjust the straps as your baby grows then nothing will press against her diaper area or anywhere else.
__label__pos	This Boppy is very comfortable.
__label__pos	I like the asymmetrical design; it allows me to tuck the larger part between my legs while the smaller part is wedged under my belly for extra support.
__label__pos	I had been having hip pain while sleeping at night and this little jobby did the trick.
__label__neg	The only negative comment I have on this is that it does tend to make me a little warm while sleeping but I think anything would.
__label__pos	All in all this was a great purchase and I would suggest it to anyone trying to adjust to sleeping on their side (I am typically a stomach sleeper) or to anyone experiencing hip pain.
__label__neu	UPDATE:  I have now had my baby and have used this pillow to help prop him up during feedings!
__label__pos	I have gotten my money's worth out of this Boppy; I use it every day still.
__label__pos	No complaints!
__label__pos	Love this carrier.
__label__neg	Only complain, baby outgrew it.
__label__neu	We did get a lot of use out of it though before that.
__label__pos	My daughter loves this gym!
__label__pos	She laughs out loud at the musical star!
__label__neu	All of our videos of her are on this mat.
__label__pos	I like it because everything is detchable and I sometimes take the birdies and attach them to her car seat.
__label__pos	She just loves all of the goodies associated with the mat.
__label__pos	I would say that this item is definately worth the money!
__label__pos	My daughter is 20 months old and loves to do it ALL herself.
__label__pos	this bib is a lifesaver, and an outfit saver.
__label__pos	The pocket is perfectly placed and the shoulders are wide enough to protect her sleeves.
__label__pos	If only I'd bought this a year ago.
__label__neu	My son is one big ball of gas.
__label__pos	We loved the Advent bottles but they didn't help with his gas problem.
__label__pos	These bottles are great for babies who don't need any more air in their tummys.
__label__pos	Also the nipples are great for babies that used to the breast, or babies that are between the breast and bottle.
__label__neu	The newborn gift set gets you going with all the bottles you will need to start things out plus some for when baby starts getting older.
__label__pos	No air in belly, price is not over the top, nipples are the best I have found, and very well made (no leaks at all)
__label__pos	This is definitely the set to get.
__label__pos	It includes everything you'll need for baby well care in a convenient storage pouch.
__label__pos	I tend to leave things all over my house but with this kit I never have to search for tiny items.
__label__pos	All of the pieces I've tried so far work very well also.
__label__pos	The clippers are my favorite since they are very easy to handle.
__label__pos	The scissors work for nails as well.
__label__pos	The brush is excellent.
__label__pos	very soft bristles for my daughter who doesn't have much hair yet.
__label__pos	Nail files and alcohol swabs are nice extras.
__label__pos	The bulb syringe works better than the one from  Gerber that I have and the thermometer was a cinch to use as well.
__label__neu	I have yet to use the medicine dropper or water temp taker but I doubt there is anything wrong with those items.
__label__pos	I also have to wait for my daughter's teeth before I test the toothbrush but it's nice that I have everything handy already.
__label__pos	I love this set and keep it clipped on my nursery cart.
__label__pos	It also comes with a useful book on taking care of your baby.
__label__pos	Definitely the best kit with the most baby essentials.
__label__neu	I bought this stroller when our son was 1 month old and used it not even for 5 months and also occasionally.
__label__neg	I found this stroller to be a piece of junk!
__label__neg	"The back bends like a letter C and our son who is not even 6 months yet was so uncomfortable that I had to buy another stroller ""Peg Perego Aria"" and am so glad I did because it is much lighter than chicco and much sturdier."
__label__neu	Peg Perego also has a bigger basket.
__label__pos	In the end, I returned the Chicco, the customer service at BabiesRUs was so great that they gave us a store credit.
__label__neg	Beware!
__label__neg	The chicco stroller at the beginning seems to be great but after a while as the child gets older and heavier, the flimsy back bends!
__label__neg	Don't waste your time and money on this stroller!
__label__pos	It really makes the newborn baby comfortable and easy to carry without a lot of blankets.
__label__pos	this is a good pump.
__label__neg	it just has a bit of a learning curve.
__label__pos	i can successfully pump 2-4oz in 10-15 min with this pump.
__label__pos	it's also quite quiet.highly recommended.
__label__pos	I've tried a few different brands of pacifiers and these were hands down the best.
__label__neu	I tried the NUK type and they kept flying out of my baby's mouth.
__label__pos	She has done well with these since birth (she is now 9 months).
__label__neg	She had some of the clear pacifiers and they were so hard to find if they fell or got misplaced.
__label__neu	Try the colored ones.
__label__pos	I highly recommend them!
__label__pos	I used an avent pump with my first and let me tell you how great this pump is.
__label__neu	All you do is attach the liner to the breast pump, fill it up, and cap it and you can store it or feed right then.
__label__pos	It is so comfortable.
__label__neu	You have 5 settings to choose from for the speed and suction.
__label__pos	It comes with bags for everything.
__label__neu	The carrying case, case for traveling with milk and bottles, and case for the parts.
__label__pos	LOVE IT!
__label__pos	It cannot get any easier than this.
__label__pos	I pump 4 ounces in less than 3 minutes.
__label__pos	Try this and you will love it
__label__pos	This is the best thing ever.
__label__neu	My daughter was in a booster seat before we got this but she wanted to feel like a big girl and sit at the table.
__label__neg	Just pushing her booster up to the table wasn't good enough.
__label__pos	The kaboost did the job.
__label__pos	It's very sturdy and easy to put on the chairs.
__label__pos	plus you can take it to restaurants without it being a pain.
__label__pos	I highly recommend it to everyone with a toddler.
__label__neu	I got this with the extension.
__label__pos	It's been great for my twins.
__label__pos	There is lots of room for them to play with each other.
__label__pos	It also offers me a safe place to put them if I need to do something quick like pour a bottle.
__label__neg	It did take some maneuvering to set up because it is large and awkward when you unfold it.
__label__neg	"It also sounds like you're breaking it because it has ""teeth"" on each hinge that pop into place in small increments (each increment makes a clicking sound)."
__label__neg	We don't bother to open or close the gate to get in and out, we just step over it.
__label__pos	It is sturdy enough that my daughter, who weighs 22lbs now, can pull herself up on it.
__label__pos	I think Gerber has the best skin care line.
__label__pos	My son had excema when he was an infant and the Gerber is the most moisturizing for his skin.
__label__pos	This is a great gift set which includes all their great scents.
__label__pos	I would highly recommend this over Baby Magic and Playtex anyday.
__label__pos	I love the boppy, when my back hurts it's the perfect way to nurse, baby loves to play on boppy!
__label__neu	I tried a couple of these types of pillows first.
__label__neu	The boppy body pillow (UGH! )
__label__neu	and a regular body pillow.
__label__pos	My Snoogle is sooooooo comfy, I didn't want to get up!
__label__pos	I felt sooo relaxed.
__label__pos	All my joints were loosened up and my hip and shoulder pain is gone!
__label__neu	"I'm 5'7"" and about 5 months preggo."
__label__pos	I'm an average size and this fits me perfectly.
__label__neg	The only thing I would change is the cover.
__label__neg	It's a poly/cotton blend and it's rough and itchy.
__label__neu	I have a friend who sews and is going to make me a new cover out of better fabric.
__label__pos	Other than that, this is the best pregnancy product I've come across (and this is my 4th baby!)
__label__neu	As I have stated with the trainer set, they are okay if your child takes to them, just don't buy more than one set if you are not sure your child will take it.
__label__neu	I would recommend buying one set from Target ( or some grocery stores cary Avent) and trying first.
__label__neu	If it works, then buy more sets online.
__label__neu	You will know within days if your child will take to it.
__label__neg	Our 2 1/2 month old son likes to sit in this seat and stare at the toys, but he doesn't care for the vibration like he does in his other bouncer.
__label__pos	This seat is easy to clean, fairly easy to move from room to room, and versatile.
__label__neg	It's not that attractive, however.
__label__neg	I bought this tub, but rarely used it.
__label__neu	As an infant my son was mostly washed while he was lying on the bed and I used a basin of water.
__label__neg	By the time he was really ready to be in a tub, we placed him on the teddy bear sponge you place in the bottom of a regular tub, which he enjoyed much better.
__label__pos	I got this for my baby shower and I LOVE-Love-Love it.
__label__pos	I put it on my kitchen table after filling under sink, and drain it from the easy-drain spout right into the sink when I am done.
__label__pos	My baby Amelia has been in it since week 1 and she is 3 months and still loves it.
__label__pos	She fits perfectly in the newborn side, and I feel safe she won't slip down.
__label__pos	I can easily bathe her alone without problems.
__label__pos	Highly recommended, especially since the tub grows with you and your baby.
__label__neu	I received this pump as a gift.
__label__pos	I like it because it is electric.
__label__pos	I got the manual attachment free from the hospital and it is very difficult to use even with the spring loading.
__label__pos	For manual use I recommend the Avent Isis.
__label__neu	However, there are times when I just feel like sitting down and not having to manually pump.
__label__pos	This works great.
__label__neu	It comes with storage containers and a nipple insert for smaller nipples.
__label__neu	Plus it comes with some lanolin just incase you get sore nipples.
__label__pos	It is a pretty good buy.
__label__neg	It doesn't work any better than a manual, but it is more convenient since you don't have to work as hard.
__label__pos	I wouldn't have bought it myself, but since it was given to me, I am glad to have it.
__label__pos	:)
__label__pos	This is a great bouncy seat.
__label__pos	My daughter loves it and it puts her to sleep almost every time.
__label__pos	She doesnt seem to really care for the massage part but she loves the music.
__label__pos	The great thing is the music is actually calming and not annoying.
__label__neg	The only thing I would change was to have it recline a little more.
__label__pos	Great product!
__label__pos	I actually used this with my Pack N Play and loved the handy organizer features.
__label__neu	I moved it to my changing table after discovering I could order one of those Pack N Play Parent Organizers as a replacement part (even from another company's product!)
__label__pos	which worked much nicer with my play yard.
__label__pos	Still - this item was very handy.
__label__neu	"Note: it only fits on the ""front"" of a changing table or play yard (the attachment arm/hook is not wide enough to hang from the sides)."
__label__neu	Update at 1 yr: still using this item.
__label__pos	A good buy & fit on the pack-n-play but also on the changing table late on.
__label__neu	Diaper Champ vs.
__label__neu	Diaper Genie.
__label__pos	Diaper Champ wins by 1 reason alone - they DO NOT REQUIRE you to buy their bags.
__label__pos	Any trash bag will do.
__label__neu	We bought a box of 500 trash bags for ten dollars; Diaper Gennie will only work with Diaper Genie Bags which are expensive.
__label__neu	Besides that, I chose this one because as we were doing our registry, a FATHER came up and told us to get it (no smells, easy to use, compact), with his 2 kids and a pregnant wife.
__label__neu	Baby in 1 hand, dirty diaper in the other, drop diaper in pail, flip bar, diaper is secured in bin.
__label__pos	You only need 1 hand to use it.
__label__pos	It's secure, it doesn't wobble.
__label__neg	The pail WILL SMELL when you open it to change the bag for a new one.
__label__neu	Otherwise, it keeps all the nasty smells inside the bin.
__label__pos	We keep ours in the garage (have had it for 9 months) and have had no problems with smells (regardless of the weather 10- to 98 degrees).
__label__neu	I estimate it holds up to 16 soiled diapers (we put the dirty wipes inside the dirty diaper so they are bulky).
__label__neu	I researched and researched forward facing car seats.
__label__neu	I debated buying this car seat for about a month.
__label__pos	I finally decided to buy it and I am glad I did.
__label__pos	Positives:Easy to install.
__label__pos	It took us about 15 minutes to install with LATCH.
__label__pos	(just read the instructions a couple of times and watch the video  on-line if you think you'll have trouble)The seat fits well forward facing in our car.
__label__pos	(Pacifica)  It actually takes up less room then her infant carrier.
__label__pos	It is easy to adjust the positions.
__label__pos	No loops, no straps to re-thread.
__label__pos	My child appears comfortable and the HUGS system ensures nothing rubs on her.
__label__pos	The safety rating is the best.
__label__neg	Negatives:The Click and Safe feature is pointless.
__label__pos	"It doesn't get snug enough, even though it ""clicks."""
__label__neg	It is actually harder to make the harness tight enough.
__label__neg	I wish we would have bought just the Boulevard.
__label__neg	For the price, not a lot of features like cup holder.
__label__neu	Not a big deal, but would have been nice.
__label__neg	It does not fit well into my husbands Civic.
__label__neg	We are looking into a  smaller Britax.
__label__pos	Overall, it is a wonderful seat.
__label__pos	It is easy to clean and I feel comfortable knowing my child is in a super safe top rated car seat.
__label__neg	I don't think I would use rear facing just because it doesn't have a removable base, so you would have to remove infant from seat to take in and out of home, store, ect.
__label__pos	Summary:  Great Forward facing infant seat!
__label__pos	I have a Medela Pump in Style for use at work -- it is faster and I can rig it through my bra to be hands-free.
__label__neu	I got the Avent Isis as a hand-me-down from my sister-in-law, who did not care for it at all.
__label__neg	I first tried it when I had a clogged duct, and I found it too painful.
__label__pos	But, I gave it a few more tries and have really come to appreciate this product.
__label__pos	Yes, it's kind of a nuisance to deal with all of the parts when cleaning, but it's quick and quiet, and when my daughter has a nap that's so long I get uncomfortable, it's so easy to grab this and squeeze out an ounce or two to make myself comfortable.
__label__neu	I imagine I will use it on days that I have to be out of the office during my usual pumping time, as I'm not about to lug the pump-in-style to court.
__label__pos	Good product.
__label__pos	My son loves to dance to music now.
__label__pos	He received this for his 1st birthday and it was an instant hit.
__label__pos	He quickly learn how to work it and he still loves to play with it at 20 months old.
__label__pos	I have a hard to entertain baby and this toy is great.
__label__neg	In the beginning the musical star startled him and we left it off.
__label__pos	He loved the mirror the best.
__label__pos	Now, at 4 months, the star is his all time favorite.
__label__pos	We have added pictures of smiling babies and cute animals to the picture holder and I change the picture everyday.
__label__neu	It helps to rearrange everything often.
__label__pos	He loves the teather ring.
__label__pos	We've also added some chimes (from another gym) that he thinks are great.
__label__pos	I don't know how long he'll be entertained by this now that he is crawling around some, but so far it's his favorite toy and allows me a good 20 minutes of free time - which for him is amazing!
__label__pos	Whoever invented these SwaddleMe wraps ought to get some kind of prize.
__label__pos	It's one of those products that you keep wondering what you would ever do without it.
__label__neu	We have three SwaddleMe wraps for our new baby (now two months old and growing fast).
__label__neu	Two are jersey and are now getting  little small for him.
__label__neu	It's now getting a little cooler (late Fall), so we got a larger microfleece model.
__label__neu	Junior seems to appreciate the extra warmth and room  I'd say the wrap is more effective and harder for him to get out of.
__label__pos	A good wrap often quiets our baby down.
__label__pos	He doesn't like getting wrapped and often cries loudly, but once he's wrapped he quiets down and even smiles.
__label__pos	It's like magic.
__label__pos	Somehow, when he can't flail his arms and legs around, he stops crying.
__label__neu	Also, he seems to sleep better and for longer spells.
__label__neu	Last night was the second of two 6-hour nights.
__label__pos	That's worth the price in itself!
__label__neu	Our little boy seems to like this fleece model a little better.
__label__neu	Maybe he likes the extra warmth.
__label__neu	Maybe it's the softness.
__label__neu	Mabe it's the larger size.
__label__neg	My wife worries a little that the fleece model seems to ride up onto his mouth and might suffocate him.
__label__neu	Personally, I think she worries too much, but I'm a little more careful in wrapping him.
__label__neu	I'd say, if he could speak, he'd say Swaddle Me in Microfleece.
__label__neu	Gary Peterson
__label__pos	baby absolutely is enthralled with this thing.
__label__pos	really glad we got it.
__label__pos	still using it to help her sleep at nights now.
__label__pos	well made, comes with a remote.
__label__neg	speaker could be a little louder.
__label__pos	These finger guards are simple to use and very effective.
__label__pos	I highly recommend this product for anyone with a toddler or infant on the go!
__label__pos	This is great for keeping the bottle or sippy cup attached to high chair, stroller, car seat, anything.
__label__pos	Easily wiped clean, adjustable band with velcro to go around bottle with rubberized grip, end attaches with velcro loop/handle.
__label__pos	Love it and have more than one.
__label__neg	"Ok, when I first heard about it, I hated it and thought,"" why do I need to spend so much money for a stupid ""c"" pillow with cover?"
__label__pos	IT IS SOOOO comfortable 3 yrs.
__label__neu	later!
__label__neu	When I 1st had it with my 1st boy, I was scared to use it for breast-feeding.
__label__pos	thought I would get dependent on it and wouldn't know what to do if it wasn't around.
__label__pos	BUT, it made breast-feeding sooo much easier, and then the sitting up stage, and well, now I use it for myself, instead of a pillow.
__label__pos	It is worth it!
__label__pos	Very comfortable for breast or bottle feeding and as a pillow for and adult!
__label__pos	You are not wasting your money!
__label__pos	Great product, nice tunes.
__label__neg	deducted one star because unit does not have the continuous play feature.
__label__neu	You have to keep pressing the play button after each song.
__label__neu	My baby is not old enough to do this on his own.
__label__pos	but he loves to stare at the flashing lights when the songs are playing.
__label__pos	I will rate this 4.5 stars out of 5.  but since we can only rate one star at a time then i rated it 4 stars here.
__label__neu	Being somewhat paranoid about germs when we had our first child, we were ultra careful with sterilizing EVERYTHING.
__label__neg	This was a time consuming process and we likely spent much more energy than needed.
__label__neu	By the time we had our second child, we were still careful but just not quite so much.
__label__pos	"Now we have the ""iQ24 Steam Sterilizer"" which drastically simplifies the sterilization process."
__label__neu	With it's two modes of operation, we can choose to quick sterilize (6 minutes) or longer (keeps sterile for 24 hrs).
__label__neu	We can't see any real need for the longer mode since the quick mode keeps the bottles sterile for 6 hrs.
__label__pos	This really beats having to boil bottles on the stove like we did for my first two children and saves us a lot of time and energy.
__label__neu	As one other reviewer noted, the iQ24 does not clean the bottles!
__label__neu	You must wash the bottles before putting them in the Sterilizer.
__label__pos	As a side note, my science minded daughter has already claimed the iQ24 for use in science projects since she knows that it can also be used to sterilize lab equipment and Petri Dishes.
__label__neu	Not quite an autoclave but usable.
__label__neu	Note that this does not come with bottles.
__label__pos	For time and energy saving convenience, highly recommended!
__label__neu	For a less expensive solution, check out the microwaveable version,Philips Avent Express II Microwave Steam Sterilizer without Bottle
__label__neu	I bought 3 of these.
__label__neu	I rinse the bottles immediately after they are used (part by part) Then I wash them in these baskets, with the dishwasher.
__label__pos	This saves a lot of time.
__label__neu	Wow!
__label__neg	When this swing arrived at our doorstep after 2 weeks of no sleep, I wept.
__label__pos	This saved me!
__label__pos	The swing is a perfect shape to hold a small baby and the rocking side to side comforted my daughter like no other.
__label__pos	It seems a little fast, but my daughter loved it.
__label__neu	Easy clean.
__label__neu	Get rechargable batteries!
__label__neu	I've tried 2 others but this one is the one!
__label__pos	It's comfortable, easy to use, very sturdy and safe.
__label__pos	Definitely worth the money.
__label__neu	I ordered these bottles to replace my Dr. Brown's bottles when my daughter was about 5 months because they were BPA free.
__label__neg	I was worried that she wouldn't take the new bottles well because they were a different size and shape but she didn't hesitate at all.
__label__pos	We have had no problems with these bottles.
__label__pos	She is now 11 months and they have held up great.
__label__neg	The one thing that I didn't like about the Dr. Brown's bottles I originally had was all of the different parts.
__label__pos	While the Born Free bottles have just as many parts to wash, you do not need a special small brush for these like you do with the Dr. Brown's bottles which I like.
__label__pos	i reccomend this to anyone looking for a safe baby bath.
__label__pos	awesome for first time parents.
__label__pos	its soft and cushy and baby doesn't slide around.
__label__neu	my daughter is 10 months old and still uses it.
__label__neu	she has used it since day oen.
__label__neg	i wouldn't go with any other tub.
__label__pos	safest tub you can buy.it does hold a lot of water, but as long as you hang it to dry, it is fine.
__label__neu	drys overnight when its hung up.
__label__pos	the best part.
__label__pos	you can toss it in the washer when it gets dirty.
__label__pos	A MUST HAVE for new mothers and fathers!
__label__neu	I used these for storing milk in the beginning.
__label__pos	I never had a problem with them leaking.
__label__neu	You really do need to screw the tops on correctly.
__label__pos	The ablility to stack these is fantastic.
__label__neu	I also use them to store home-made baby food, pudding, etc!
__label__pos	The size is perfect for toddler portions and storing bite-sized pieces of fruits and vegies, cereals, etc.
__label__pos	Yes, I have the usual collection of other brands of storage containers but I like the sturdiness of these.
__label__pos	They don't dent in my diaper bag or purse.
__label__pos	A great product that is easily re-purposed!
__label__neg	I feel bad that some people have had such a poor experience with this lock.
__label__pos	We on the other hand love these locks.
__label__neu	We bought our first set 7 years ago to use with our first child.
__label__neu	One set of Grandparents use them and an aunt too.
__label__pos	I am just about to get a second set because we have a new crawler and I want to put them on the bathroom cabinets.
__label__pos	They are a bit expensive but you will never need to buy locks again.
__label__pos	We prefer to leave our on at all times (even when our children don't need the cabinets locked anymore) because they are easy to turn off (just a flip of the red tab inside the cabinet) that way they are there whenever you have little ones visiting your home.
__label__pos	We have never split a cabinet and we don't think it takes that much longer to install then any other cabinet locks.
__label__pos	You will have to drill in you cupboard doors but your little one(s) will be protected.
__label__neg	It leaves no room for fingers to get pinched either.
__label__neg	If you do happen to lose your lock you can buy a strong magnet from your home improvement store and still get it open.
__label__neu	We like to keep our lock on the metal frame by the kitchen window above the sink.
__label__pos	Good luck whatever you decide.
__label__pos	I love this car seat.
__label__pos	The fabric is nice.
__label__pos	The straps easily adjust which matters right now because we are transitioning between seasons and sometimes my daughter has a jacket or sweater and sometimes not.
__label__pos	It got the highest safety ratings everywhere I checked and of course that is the most important thing.
__label__pos	It was also much easier to install than I thought.
__label__neg	I had it installed at the fire station but had to take out.
__label__neu	I decided to try myself instead of taking it back to the fire company and I was able to install it.
__label__neu	I originally bought this as a way to make sure my baby stayed on her back or side while sleeping.
__label__pos	It works great for this!
__label__pos	However, I found an even better use!
__label__pos	My baby kicks the blankets off of her every night, even if I swaddle her, and I used to worry all night that she was uncovered and cold.
__label__neu	So I take a receiving blanket and tuck it in all around her under the sleep positioner mat, so it makes it very hard for her to kick off the covers!
__label__pos	I think this is a must have for all new parents and babies!
__label__pos	This bathtub is great!
__label__pos	My 3 month old loves the water, and seems to feel very secure in the mesh cradle included.
__label__pos	The tub fits perfectly in my kitchen sink, and has a little compartment to hold soap etc.
__label__neu	Edited to say: At almost 8 months we are still using this bathtub!
__label__neu	We moved it from the sink into the tub quite a while ago, and took the mesh cradle out.
__label__neu	He is almost too big for it now, and we'll be looking at those bath seats.
__label__pos	However, there are not that many baby items that you can say you got almost 8 months use from - so I'm very satisfied.
__label__pos	Great purchase - highly recommended!
__label__pos	Our daughter has used this tub since her first day home at 4 pounds and the tub has made bathing her very easy even that small!
__label__pos	Now that she is bigger, (5 months old, 11 pounds) she still uses the sling and we love that the pillow moves up to cushion her head and the plastic divider below supports her tushie.
__label__neu	I suggest always drying out the tub/sling after each bath by squeezing out excess water from the pillow and turning tub over to air dry.
__label__pos	We have never had any problem with mildew (like some users) because we always dry out the tub between baths.
__label__neg	I waited a really long time to buy this because it felt like a lot of money to pay for a smock.
__label__neu	I regret waiting at all.
__label__pos	It makes feeding time infinitely easier- I don't have to completely strip down my toddler anymore or spend hours trying to clean out stains.
__label__pos	It's long enough to cover his lap beyond the highchair tray (if you don't use a tray, part of the legs will still be exposed for spills).
__label__neu	The neck is high enough to cover his collar which used to get hit even with a bib.
__label__pos	It's really easy to clean, and I'm no longer afraid to let my child feed himself goopy, staining foods!
__label__pos	It's completely worth it and I wish I'd had it since he started solids.
__label__pos	Later edit: We've now had this smock for about 2 years and it's barely showing signs of wear.
__label__neu	I throw it in the laundry about once a week for a thorough cleaning and just wipe it down with a paper towel between meals.
__label__neu	The best way to get it clean is to turn it inside out in the wash and then hang it over a chair.
__label__pos	It will dry extremely fast and get really clean.
__label__neg	If you don't turn it inside out, the sleeves have a hard time drying on the inside where the absorbent fabric is.
__label__pos	We LOVE this smock and just ordered a second one for my daughter.
__label__pos	I used these bottles and had no problems whatsoever.
__label__neg	They helped with gas yet were not a pain to clean (like the Dr. Brown's bottles.
__label__neg	oh my gosh.
__label__neg	talk about time consuming).
__label__neg	Others mentioned leaking around the bottom of the bottle; I had a bottle leak one time but soon realized I did not have the plastic disc in place completely.
__label__pos	I readjusted the disc and everything was fine.
__label__pos	Also, I have put the bottles together many times with them still wet and have had no problems.
__label__pos	keeps baby's skin warm, rather than putting them directly on the cold changing pad surface.
__label__pos	i have washed it several times, and it handles well in the washer/dryer.
__label__pos	Whenever he sees me packing any snacks in these cups, he loves to have them.
__label__pos	they are easy to use, large enough to fill up a good amount of snacks that will last few hours of play.
__label__neg	I had used the snack-trap ones before.
__label__neg	those are badly made.
__label__neg	the lids don't last at all.
__label__neg	after a few use, the trap leaves a big hole and so the food falls out of the cup easily.
__label__pos	My son loves these cups, they feel clean and it's BPA free!
__label__pos	The picture and sound quality is decent on this camera.
__label__neg	The main problem I have is the battery life.
__label__neg	It is definitely not enough to last through the whole night.
__label__neu	The camera unit has to be hooked up to the AC adapter most of the day and the monitor has to get recharged every 4 hours.
__label__neu	In order to get the monitor fully charged you have to let it charge for 3 hours.
__label__neg	I would not recommend this monitor to anyone.
__label__neg	Try to look for a monitor with a longer battery life.
__label__pos	This swing is well designed in every way.
__label__pos	The seat is soft and baby-shaped, the different speeds are great, the music is not annoying at all, the toy bar is cute, the fabric is cozy and attractive, the fold-up legs are so helpful, the small size stays out of the way, the recline is perfect for newborns and sleeping babies, and the battery life is great.
__label__pos	I liked the idea of taking it from room to room like others have said, but I'm finding that in reality, with a baby in one arm, I just can't.
__label__neg	It's a little bit awkward to carry one-handed, and the legs, when open, are too wide to fit through the doorways of my 1850's apartment so I'd need to put the baby down to fold it-- too many steps!
__label__pos	I love, love, love this swing, and I'll continue to use it, but I'm back here to buy a really light, cheap bouncy seat to easily travel with us from bathroom to kitchen to den etc.
__label__neu	I just received this item as a baby shower gift, so my review is somewhate limited since I haven't actually used it yet!
__label__neg	Nonetheless, a few things I noted.
__label__neg	First, the way in which the hanging toys are attached to the activity bar is different than what is pictured.
__label__neg	They do not go through loops that hang down from the bar, but rather velcro onto it.
__label__neg	That's fine, except the velcro is backwards, in my opinion, for the cow.
__label__neg	Or, the cow needs to have a face on both sides!
__label__neu	The way it attaches, the baby looks at the back of it's blank white head!
__label__neg	The cow should be for the baby, not the parents to look at!
__label__neg	Also, the vibration is really, really loud -- at least without a baby sitting in the seat.
__label__neg	I assume the baby's body muffles the sound, since no one else noted this in their review.
__label__pos	On the positive side, it was simple to assemble and you can use it up to 40 lbs!
__label__neu	We just set up our son's nursery and tested out the Sony monitor.
__label__neu	I sat in the nursery opposite side of the room from the monitor and whispered as quietly as I could as my husband walked all over our house.
__label__neu	He could hear me everywhere he went, both upstairs and down.
__label__neg	We were a little concerned with finding a monitor that would work for us, because we live in an old Victorian house with plaster walls.
__label__neg	To use cell phones in our house, you have to stand by a window and not move or you will lose your call.
__label__pos	The Sony 27 channel monitor worked perfectly!
__label__pos	We couldn't ask for anything more!
__label__neg	I was reluctant to register for this tub because it was so affordable.
__label__pos	But it is GREAT!
__label__pos	I don't know what I would've done without it because it comes with a net to place newborns in.
__label__pos	and their heads are so wobbily, you really can't do without it.
__label__neg	I will lay her down and she will go through all three fifteen minutes settings, only fussing if we take to long to start it over.
__label__neg	I wish the one I purchased had a remote, and I also wish that it worked with an adapter, because the battery gets used up real fast.
__label__pos	Overall, very very happy with this product.
__label__neu	that's both me and my daughter
__label__neu	I had been using the Take and Toss ones in the sippy cups and saw these with the straws.
__label__neu	It's one step closer to moving my son to using regular cups.
__label__pos	He feels like a big boy using a cup and straw instead of a sippy cup like his baby brother.
__label__neg	They last with repeated use for several months then ours eventually develop a crack in them from being thrown on the floor.
__label__neg	I do hand wash mine even though they state top-rack dishwasher safe and I believe that helps them last a little longer.
__label__pos	My sons are at the age where we are transitioning them from sippy cups to regular cups and these are perfect for that in-between stage.
__label__neu	These are also labeled plastic type 5 which is polypropylene which is considered safe and does not leach BPA (bisphenol-A) into foods and beverages like some plastics can.
__label__pos	That makes me feel better and sets my mind at ease about using these with my children.
__label__neg	Make sure that you put the lid on the cup and then insert the straw.
__label__neg	If you are refilling and take the top off with the straw still in and then replace, liquid will come shooting out the straw.
__label__pos	I have loved this pump.
__label__pos	I have used it since I got home from the hospital and my daughter is now 10 weeks old.
__label__neu	The only other pump I have experience with is the Medela Symphony in the hospital.
__label__neg	I found the 3 minute letdown feature annoying on it.
__label__pos	The Hygeia Enjoye jumps right in just like the baby and works well.
__label__pos	It pumped better for me than the Symphony did in the hospital.
__label__pos	I have never had any complications with it and use it daily, sometimes multiple times.
__label__neg	I understand the reason for the baby recording button, however, I find it silly and annoying since I seem to hit it by accident.
__label__pos	I have not had issues with pumping so it may be useful if you do.
__label__pos	I would recommend this pump to anyone and love that it is more green and can safely be reused by others.
__label__pos	Nothing has broke or worn out.
__label__pos	I could think of a few improvements like the ability to pump into storage bags, etc, however, for the price and quality I give it 5 bright stars.
__label__pos	These bottles are a true must have!
__label__pos	They are the only worthwhile bottles on the market and are well worth the extra price as well as the extra time to wash.
__label__pos	They really limit the gas intake and we never had an issue with leaking bottles, like so many other brands.
__label__neg	It is a bit of a hassle to get all the pieces in the dishwasher.
__label__pos	I like the wide neck bottles because they are closer to breast feeding and when my son got older, it was easier for him to hold the bottle on his own.
__label__pos	This pump is very good.
__label__neu	I had to pump while my daughter was in the hospital the first month of her life.
__label__neu	During the day I used the hospital grade pumps at the hospital, but at night I used this pump until finally buying the double electric Medela pump.
__label__pos	I got just as much milk with this pump as I did the hospital pump.
__label__neu	I only used the electric plug, never batteries.
__label__pos	It is a handy pump to have.
__label__pos	I don't see how a nursing mom can go without ever having to pump at some point, even if its for cereal when they start that.
__label__pos	Medela is definitely the best pump to get, and don't even think about a manual one.
__label__pos	I never pump now since I'm home with my baby, but I am so glad I have this pump.
__label__neg	It is definitely loud, but putting a folded towel over it helps.
__label__pos	If you have to pump a lot, and can afford it, a double pump is the way to go though.
__label__pos	it takes half the time, which is very important when you have a baby to take care of.
__label__pos	This swing is the best!
__label__pos	There is so much fun going on, it's like our baby has her own personal Disney ride at home!
__label__pos	The music is great & she loves to stare at the fish & lights in the water filled globe.
__label__pos	The seat is plush & comfortable with a colorful fish pattern.
__label__pos	Seat cover washes nicely.
__label__neu	She even falls asleep in it sometimes.
__label__pos	It was pretty easy to put together-just follow the directions.
__label__neg	We tried to install his under our car seat, but it didn't fit easily under the seat base in our small car, and seemed to make installation more difficult.
__label__neg	Rather than risk it, we haven't used it.
__label__neg	This is very heavy so that it cannot be lifted by any young child.
__label__neg	My 8 year old cannot lift it.
__label__neg	But it can slide a little if your child puts their weight on it.
__label__neg	It will not topple over as this is impossible.
__label__neu	I use it to block my garage so that my 2 year old doesn't run out of the garage and into the street.
__label__neg	Once your child is too big to fit in a playpen, you can get this so that they have more room to play, but still have them contained.
__label__neg	It is very difficult during the first few times you open and close it.
__label__pos	But it does loosen up and becomes easy enough to setup alone.
__label__pos	It is actually better that the joints don't move so easily so that your child cannot change the shape of the play yard when they push against it.
__label__pos	The safer bather is the BEST baby bath aid out there!
__label__pos	It's soft but not squishy, contoured so baby dosn't roll off, small and easy to store, machine washable, and babies love it!
__label__neu	What else could you ask for?
__label__pos	I don't know how anyone could choose one of those big, clunky tubs over this.
__label__pos	***UPDATE***Almost 3 years, two kids and many baths later this safer bather is still getting used and works just like it did when it was new!
__label__pos	My son would not take naps in his crib but would nap for hours in this swing.
__label__pos	The soothing music and sounds are very pleasant and my son likes to look at himself in the mirrored part.
__label__pos	My son is four months and this product is perfect.
__label__pos	No smells at all!
__label__pos	Holds a decent amount of diapers, my husband empties it once a week.
__label__pos	No down side, all pluses here!
__label__pos	Especially no special bags to buy.
__label__pos	And when your child is out of diapers, you can use it as a regular trash can to put food or pet waste in.
__label__pos	I switched to these from Avent with no problems.
__label__pos	So far I like these better.
__label__pos	My son didn't want to switch to the Stage 3 until he was almost 8 months old - so I'd try them out before I plunged.
__label__neu	My husband and I bought this for our little girl's nursery.
__label__pos	It's perfect; however, the amber lights are barely visible - even when the room is completely dark.
__label__neg	Furthermore, the blue lights are not that great (although better than the amber ones).
__label__pos	The best are the green stars.
__label__pos	They are the most clear and most visible.
__label__pos	Overall, we are very pleased with this product and would recommend it to others.
__label__pos	Enjoy!
__label__pos	My trio loved this thing and still will play with it, lol.
__label__neu	Each section is a squeaky, crinkle or rattle, and the mouth squeezes to play music.
__label__neg	If you wash it, the music stops playing though, lol.
__label__neu	I like to use reusable washable nursing pads at home, since they are softer than disposables & more comfortable.
__label__neg	Like other reusable pads, I won't wear them away from home because they could leak through, and they are more bulky and so can be seen through my clothing.
__label__neg	These are soft and I prefer the jersey version of these pads (the fleece version tended to leave lint on my skin if it wasn't completely dry--yuck for baby!
__label__neu	).
__label__neg	I do not use the individual smaller containers that came with it.
__label__neg	They don't seem that useful to me.
__label__pos	But the main dish I like this because it is very useful to keep veggies and fruits separate when feeding my baby.
__label__pos	It is a decent size.
__label__pos	These buckets are better and safer than a toy chest!
__label__neu	The different sizes allow allow us to organize some if we choose or grab one to take on a trip.
__label__pos	My daughter loves playing with them and it is easy for her to take her toys in and out.
__label__pos	I haven't had to worry about safety with them either as they collapse easily.
__label__pos	I love our wipe warmer!
__label__neu	I've also seen some of the negative feedback, and I don't have of those problems at all!
__label__pos	If you follow the directions with the package, your wipe warmer will be fine!
__label__neg	The Ever-Fresh pad at the bottom does dry out, but we just re-wet it each time we replace the wipes.
__label__neu	I've never had any wipes get brown or dried out.
__label__neu	The wipes stay warm long enough for me to use them - I just make sure to pull out a wipe as I need it.
__label__neu	And yes, some wipes are not made for the top part that allows another wipe to pull out after.
__label__neg	But all you need to do is buy the wipes that are folded that way.
__label__neu	I buy the Especially for Baby wipes in the big box.
__label__neu	You can get them at any Babies R Us or Toys R Us.
__label__neu	It costs about $10, and lasts us for over a month.
__label__pos	Plus, they're nice and soft and have no scent.
__label__neg	The ONLY complaint I might have about the wipe warmer is that when I pull out a wipe, another wipe usually comes out with it unless I use 2 hands to pull.
__label__neg	But this is a minor issue.
__label__pos	I'd much prefer to have the wipe warmer.
__label__pos	This isn't a necessary item, but it's definitely something worthwhile to have!
__label__neu	Ok, I have to say that since I became a mom 3 yrs.
__label__pos	ago, I have LOVED FP toys!
__label__pos	And this bouncy seat/rocker has been one of my favorites!
__label__pos	I gave it up recently when my 1 1/2 yr. old was tired of it after using it with my now 3 yr. old AND I just have to say  that it was a life-saver sometimes!
__label__pos	I wish all their stuff was this good!
__label__neg	You'll have to read more of my reviews about OTHER toys to see what disappointed me.
__label__pos	This bouncy/toddler rocker is a good buy!
__label__pos	You won't regret it!
__label__neu	As a first-time mom to a now 6 month old boy, I have run the gamut in terms of baby toys.
__label__pos	This is one of the best I have come across so far.
__label__pos	It's durable and educational.
__label__pos	I love that it doesn't matter what end you set it on.
__label__pos	There is no upside-down to this toy.
__label__pos	My son can pick it up and move it around with one hand, so it isn't too heavy, which is definitely a bonus.
__label__pos	He likes hearing the sand/rattle sound when I turn it over for him.
__label__pos	He likes to spin the little pieces and/or watch me spin them.
__label__pos	There is so much to see and do with this toy, and I love that the creators of it didn't feel the need to design it with all kinds of flashing lights, silly songs, and other bells and whistles.
__label__pos	If you want a good, basic, entertaining, educational (and I might even venture old-fashioned in some ways) toy, you should definitely get this one.
__label__neu	My son has to actually do something with this toy rather than listen to it and watch some lights flash.
__label__neg	I'm a little tired of all the toys that I've come across that don't really do anything except drain batteries.
__label__neg	I like the more classic purpose behind this toy.
__label__neg	I received this as a gift, unforutnately it didn't fit on our stroller (pretty standard Graco Travel System) or on our carseat (either our Grace or our Marathon) and so it was pretty useless.
__label__neg	I was worried that the extension would be loose, or threaten the integrity and safety of the gate itself.
__label__pos	But it isn't, and doesn't, and took literally seconds to snap onto the gate.
__label__pos	Yahoo!
__label__neg	I had trouble getting my breastfed baby to take an Avent bottle (which my first took beautifully) so I called the lactation consultants at the hospital to ask their advice.
__label__neg	They suggested the Evenflo classic bottles which are like these except plastic with the clear nipple.
__label__pos	They worked great.
__label__neu	"After swearing by Avent with my first, I never imagined the solution to feeding my second would be an ""old-fashioned"" type bottle."
__label__neu	It works though so I will stick with them.
__label__pos	My little girl loves trying to use this cup.
__label__neu	I say trying because she is breastfed and hasn't even learned to use a bottle yet.
__label__pos	She loves the colors and likes to see the liquid inside this cup.
__label__pos	The handles are perfect for her little hands to grab and the sippy nipple is soft enough for her to use.
__label__pos	She is still learning but this product is so great we might skip bottles all together and graduate to these after the breast!
__label__neu	I've had this diaper pail for 3 years now, and it's been through 2 kids (both in diapers for 18 months of that!).
__label__pos	I love this diaper pail!
__label__pos	My favorite feature is that it doesn't require special refills--it can use any trash bag (we just use a tall kitchen trash bag).
__label__pos	My 3 1/2 year old still hasn't figured out how to open it, but it's easy enough for me to open quickly.
__label__neg	The only times I have had a problem with odors is if too many diapers are stuffed into the pail.
__label__pos	Even then, these odors can be minimized with a bit of baking soda sprinkled in the bottom of the pail.
__label__pos	Although I debate the necessity of ANY diaper pail, this one receives 5 stars from me!
__label__pos	I like this wrap a lot and I am really into baby-wearing.
__label__pos	The fabric is really soft and it comes in so many nice colors.
__label__pos	My daughter loves it, too.
__label__neg	My only problem is that it's a little complicated.
__label__neg	It's not easy enough to get it on and off.
__label__neg	And when my baby wakes up and wants to be fed, I'd really like to be able to get us out of the wrap faster (sometimes I am able to just shift her around and feed her in the wrap).
__label__neg	My only other issue is that it's very warm - and I live in a hot climate.
__label__neg	She can't wear it for too long without getting overheated and fussy.
__label__neu	I don't think this will be as big of a problem next summer, though, when I can use .
__label__pos	I've started using the maya wrap more, because it's easier and cooler, but it's not as versatile.
__label__neg	If I had to choose between them I'd choose the moby.
__label__pos	Love this stroller.
__label__pos	It is a breeze to assemble, light, easy to carry.
__label__pos	It folds compactly with one hand (wonders when you're holding a chunky squirmer), turns on a dime, and the handles are comfortable for extended walks.
__label__pos	The front wheels can be locked for pushing over grass or other rougher surfaces, and surprisingly it works really well.
__label__pos	My 6 month old rides in it with no trouble, and it will easily accomodate her growing little body for well over a year.
__label__pos	The seat is cushioned, the ride is smooth.
__label__neg	Two drawbacks - the sunshade doesn't extend out very far, offering limited protection at best.
__label__neg	It also attaches kind of funky - you have to fold back the fabric on the side bars and snap it over a little button, which doesn't hold it securely at all.
__label__neg	I overcame this by purchasing a rayshade by kiddtopomus for $11.
__label__neg	The other minor drawback is that the seat does not come up all the way.
__label__neg	It lets down smoothly for sleeping, but baby has to sit slightly reclined when it is pulled up as far as it will go.
__label__neg	My girl doesn't seem to mind this at all, but other babies might.
__label__neu	I don't have a problem with the small storage area underneath, or the lack of cup-holders.
__label__neg	If you're not struggling with juggling a baby AND a bag, it is pretty easy to push a stroller and sip on drink.
__label__pos	I like this mobile, the leaves moving up and down, the animals slowly moving around.
__label__pos	this is lovely, with soft music for baby, and even a little night light.
__label__pos	This is a gorgeous exotic looking mobile.
__label__pos	It is pleasant to look at and always catches my sons eye.
__label__pos	This does run on big batteries, not included.
__label__neg	It requires some assembly.
__label__pos	I was able to put it together :) must have a philps screwdriver.
__label__neg	The music is ok, but none of the music is listed under the correct composer, that isn't a serious problem at all, but something worth noting.
__label__neu	Mozart plays bach, Bach plays Beethoven, Beethoven plays Mozart.
__label__pos	This is a good quality product, just what I wanted, and I think i love it more than my son does.
__label__pos	My daughter is six months old and absolutely LOVES this jumperoo.
__label__pos	It has enough to keep her interested for as long as I let her sit in it.
__label__pos	She loves the music so dances and jumps up and down.
__label__pos	We dno't know what we'd do without this!
__label__pos	This is a quality rack that holds a lot, fits in a small space, and rotates for easy access.
__label__pos	I can see that it probably wouldn't support glass bottles, but for everything else it's great.
__label__neu	We use this to organize creams, wipes and diapers on the changing table.
__label__pos	It keeps the area clear or clutter and we use it every couple of hours, so I can't complain.
__label__neg	If I could change one thing I would want it to hold a few more diapers.
__label__pos	I would recommend this to a friend and would purchase it again.
__label__pos	I bought this for our infant son after reading the glowing reviews on this site.
__label__pos	People are right!
__label__pos	This is a must-have!
__label__pos	We've used this for about four months now and it makes bathing our baby so simple.
__label__pos	It holds him comfortably and I never end up with back strain.
__label__pos	The Safer Bather also dries very easily.
__label__pos	A great product!
__label__pos	This is THE best way to sterilize bottles, bottle pieces, pacifiers, and breastpump parts.
__label__pos	It is quick and easy.
__label__pos	Forget boiling water or whatever else, get the microwave sterilizer.
__label__pos	This sippy is great!
__label__pos	My 9 month old son has no problems holding it or sucking out of it.
__label__pos	"I had no issues taking the spout off as it has a small ""lip"" to pry with your fingers."
__label__pos	It does drip slightly when held upside down, but what sippy doesn't?
__label__pos	We LOVE this sippy and recommend highly!
__label__neg	The only issue we see with it is cleaning, it's a very unique shape and you've gotta wiggle that bottle brush in there to get the bottom middle part.
__label__neu	"After searching online and in many retail stores at malls, Target, Babies and Toys 'R Us and Walmart, I was only finding these gauze type ""cloth diapers""."
__label__neu	I was appalled that these were considered soft enough or absorbent at all to be put close to my baby.
__label__neu	So, after no success, I came on to Amazon and found the many incredible reviews of this product using them as burp cloths.
__label__pos	I decided to order one package and when they arrived I was thrilled at how soft they were and looked forward to using them with my new baby.
__label__neg	They absorb a great amount of formula since my son is quite a dribbler and they wash wondefully.
__label__pos	In fact, I think they have even gotten softer.
__label__pos	We were so happy with this product that we purchased another package within the first few days that we used them.
__label__pos	So, if you are looking to use them the way we did and find that the gauze type found in most stores to be unacceptable, then get these!
__label__pos	You won't regret it!
__label__neu	I bought these for my son for his infant carrier.
__label__pos	He loves them!
__label__pos	Whenever we are out and he gets upset, I pull or swing the bugs and he stops.
__label__neg	Unfortunately he'll be in a regular seat soon and I don't think I'll be able to use them anymore.
__label__neg	Also I wish the 'vibrating' bug went up slower.
__label__pos	Other than that great toy!
__label__pos	Also a great price!
__label__neu	When we fostered our first child  a friend let us use a very similar one from One step ahead.
__label__pos	We made it huge by not closing the ends together but make a semi circle wall against a wall outlet free wall and she had the best time in her area I never had to worry about her safety as I went about my daily chores, she even took naps in it.
__label__neu	She cried when I took her out of it.
__label__pos	And she enjoyed it outside as well.
__label__pos	We had to give that one back and when our new baby was born we bought this and have road tested it with my 16 month old nephew he loves it as well and his parents are buying it for him and his new brother on the way.
__label__pos	I would say of all of our baby gear purchases this was the best!
__label__neu	We received this gift for our son and have used it since he was born.
__label__pos	He is 21 months old and still loves looking at the stars.
__label__pos	"He will point to the ceiling and say ""stars."""
__label__pos	He loves pressing the buttons to change the colors on the ceiling.
__label__pos	We have no problem seeing the amber color on his ceiling.
__label__pos	We are going to buy the sea turtle one for our baby on the way.
__label__pos	It will be nice to have the both since we are turtle fans!
__label__pos	I think this gift along with the sleep sheep by the same company are wonderful!
__label__neg	I understand that some people might have a problem with this bottle type.
__label__neg	If you screw the top on crooked at all or too tightly - you may have issues.
__label__neg	But if you take a second and make sure that you are screwing on the top properly - you might have a leaking bottle once every 30 or 40 tries.
__label__pos	I have used 4 of the other top brands and am very pleased with Avent.
__label__neg	The Brownies are really good too - but just too hard to clean on a regular basis.
__label__pos	If you only use a bottle once in a while - use browns - but if you use them a lot - get Avent.
__label__pos	Only way to go.
__label__pos	I like this toy because my almost 6-month old son can easily grab and hold on to it.
__label__neg	However, he's at the stage where he wants to put everything in his mouth, and he tends to get frustrated becaues this doesn't really lend itself to being chewed on.
__label__pos	I think he'll like it more when he can play with it like a ball, rather than trying to use it as a teether.
__label__neg	The product looks and functions more or less as expected, well much more like less.
__label__neg	Unfortunately, the plastic is weak and overly flexible, whereas it should be strong  to resist bending it off.
__label__neg	Also, the locking mechanism is too easy.
__label__neg	The product doesn't work well on straight knobs that don't have anything to hang on to.
__label__neg	I don't recommend this product for a cabinet you really want to keep secure.
__label__neg	If a child is incapable of removing this then it also means s/he can't open a door either, because it is so easy to remove, so don't get it.
__label__neg	After using this product for over a year as an infant has grown into a toddler, my opinion of it has gone down further.
__label__neg	The plastic is so flexible that it is very easy for a child to take it off.
__label__neg	If anything, this product is more of a toy than a barrier.
__label__neg	I have tried it with several kinds of drawer knobs and it doesn't work with any of them.
__label__neu	My son used this until he refused to sit in the basket anymore.
__label__neu	I just washed it every so often and kept it in my car for next time.
__label__pos	Maks them more comfy and keeps them warmer in winter.
__label__pos	I originally bought this for my daughter's lunches, but it's so darn cute and the size is just right to fit in my bag that I ended up using it and bought her something else.
__label__pos	So - if you eat a huge meal, I guess it wont work for you, but your average sandwich, chips, fruit and/or cookie plus napkin fits in just fine.
__label__pos	Plus it's super easy to clean and has thermal properties.
__label__pos	So - not just for kids :o)
__label__pos	It was fairly easy to put together, (I did it myself in about half an hour with the baby watching me).
__label__pos	It was well worth it for the price and as the weeks have gone on he interacts with the different toys in different ways.
__label__neu	We got this infant seat from a local Once Upon a Child.
__label__pos	We hadn't read any of the reviews, but picks it because of its soft seat and soft-pastel colors.
__label__pos	Our baby passed out in it for hours in her first few weeks.
__label__neg	Then, she hated sitting there and cried endelessly whenever we placed her there.
__label__neg	We tried attaching the bunny, but she hated that even more.
__label__neg	As she neared 8 weeks old, she learned to find comfort in a pacifier and would accept sitting there with a pacifier to sleep.
__label__neg	sometimes.
__label__pos	Today, she is 10 weeks old and I finally had the sense to install batteries in it!
__label__pos	Following a fit of 15 minutes of nonstop crying, she cried on and off for another 10 mintes to the vibrations and music, then passed out altogether.
__label__pos	This is the first day in almost two weeks that she has fallen so soundly asleep there.
__label__pos	The music is gorgeous, by the way.
__label__pos	Another plus is is compact foldability.
__label__pos	Very easy to fold and carry from location to location.
__label__neg	I wish this were the case for all baby gear, although if you research and choose wisely, there are plenty of options out there.
__label__pos	We LOVE that it is so soft and accomodates up to 25 pounds.
__label__pos	Our 2 and 3/4 year old son is only about 22-23 pounds and still sits there.
__label__neg	Be careful to always buckle baby in or else she slides downwards pretty easily and quickly.
__label__pos	This product has made bath time a completely fun experience with NO TEARS!
__label__neg	My 21 month old daughter hated to get her hair rinsed either by laying her down to rinse or pour water over her head.
__label__neu	She would always duck her head and end up getting it into her eyes.
__label__pos	This solves our problem.
__label__pos	It suctions around her head perfectly and leaves her face completely dry while completely rinsing her hair.
__label__neu	I wish I would have found and purchased this sooner!
__label__pos	My baby loves this.
__label__neu	we hang it from his play gym to keep it interesting.
__label__pos	It appears very well made and gives him a new texture/weight of toy to play with.
__label__pos	I love this system because it's so easy.
__label__neu	Rather that washing the bottle you can just change the liner and wash the nipple.
__label__neu	"I use store brand non-drop-ins because theyre cheaper and the regular ""bag"" liner colapses easier."
__label__neg	I agree with other reveiwers, the slow flow nipples that come with the bottle are worthless.
__label__neg	My 1 month old gets frusterated that nothing is coming out.
__label__neg	We tried the tri-cut and again he got frusterated so i ripped the cut a little bigger and that works so I went and got the fast flow.
__label__neu	Yes these pads are thicker than most.
__label__neu	"I usually put them over my fist and try to shape them ""rounder"" before I put them in my bra."
__label__pos	I like these the best because they don't have the plastic liner on the backs.
__label__pos	"This is important to me because I don't want ""liquid"" locked in between plastic and my skin."
__label__neu	"Also, I don't feel as if they are as ""hot""."
__label__pos	I wish I could say they were too small but I have found them to be the perfect size for smaller women A-B cups.
__label__pos	I have never had a leak-through and have been very pleased with the success of these pads.
__label__pos	I love this product.
__label__neu	You can use any regular trash bag.
__label__pos	So far we have noticed NO odors.
__label__pos	It is easy to use.
__label__neu	It fills up somewhat quickly, but you can make it last longer by wrapping diapers tightly before placing in the champ.
__label__pos	The price is very affordable as well.
__label__pos	My daughter loves being in her swing.
__label__neu	and usually falls asleep in it.
__label__pos	I can count on at least an hour or 2 of 'me' time when shes sleeping in it.
__label__neg	It goes with the rest of the Windsor products I have, but here are my complaints about the swing.
__label__neu	1.
__label__neg	The motor is a bit noisy, but does not overbear the music.2.
__label__neg	In order to snap the tray down, I have to bend it a bit.
__label__neg	it does not align perfectly with the end it snaps onto.3.
__label__neg	I wish there was a locking option for when I put my daughter in the chair, so the swing wouldn't move when Im trying to put her in it.4.
__label__neg	I had the same problem with the mobile falling to the back, but if you move the arm forward enough, it doesn't fall back, but it wont turn, because the bears hit the area where the motor is.
__label__neu	I'd rather it not turn than her not see it at all.5.
__label__neg	I can only find the tray toys online at the Graco website, but they give you no description.6.
__label__neg	You're supposed to be able to fold it up, but I haven't figured it out yet.
__label__neu	looks like I'll have to find the manual.
__label__pos	I gave it 4 stars because it looks nice and it does do the job its supposed to do (entertain my daughter) which is the most important thing to me.
__label__neu	Before this swing my son only slept well when he co-slept with me.
__label__pos	Now I have this swing next to my bed and he sleeps in this swing every night.
__label__pos	It rocks him to sleep and he'll stay comfortably asleep in it for most of the night.
__label__pos	Recently we traveled and I dissembled it (an easy process) and packed it in a suitcase with the rest of his stuff.
__label__pos	He was able to sleep comfortably, just the same as usual, while we were away from home.
__label__pos	That alone is priceless!
__label__pos	I like the ability to set the timer for it to turn off and I like that the music isn't obnoxious.
__label__pos	Also, it seems like when you are on the lowest levels the swing is hardly moving.
__label__pos	This is a great transition for the swing stopping and can help baby sleep in it longer.
__label__pos	The portability of this swing in great -- I've taken it into the bathroom to have him close while I get ready for the day and I've taken it to our backyard so that I can watch our older child play.
__label__neu	We have a full sized cradle swing we keep in the living room for during the day, but I wouldn't want to live without this as our nighttime and traveling swing.
__label__pos	This swing really does all that it offers.
__label__pos	You'll save on buying a bouncer since this is included.
__label__neg	As for the noise, it does make a slight sound, but not as loud as the previous reviews made it out to be.
__label__neg	I tried the other swings before ordering this one since I heard about the noise, and they all either make some type of clicking/moving sound due to the movement.
__label__neu	If your sweet peace is really that loud, then you may consider returning it.
__label__neg	On the down side, it is a bit expensive for a swing, but then there are those other extra options you pay for.
__label__pos	This is a great bag for longer trips.
__label__pos	It holds so much and is very durable.
__label__pos	The changing pad is a great size.
__label__pos	Both my husband and I love the look of the bag.
__label__pos	We feel a little more trendy when carrying this one.
__label__neg	I've had this pillow for 3 weeks and I am still not convinced.it does kind of help but I still find myself laying on the other side.
__label__neg	Not as comfortable as I thought it would be.
__label__pos	great product.
__label__pos	well made and versitle.
__label__pos	I use it on our Bugaboo Bee and its a perfect fit.
__label__pos	My sons gums are sore but he is not really teething yet so as of yet this item provides good entertainment, he loves shaking it about.
__label__neu	If it helps sore gums I am not so sure but we will see when that time comes.
__label__neu	I ordered this sippy cup for my daughter because it was BPA free.
__label__neg	It now sits in our cupboard, not used because I could never get the plastic taste out of it.
__label__neg	I would also caution parents with babies who are just starting to use sippy cups that this is not a great one to start with.
__label__neg	While it may be effective in preventing spills, it also is hard for newbies to get fluids out because they have to suck so hard and they are not used to doing that.
__label__neu	I use these wipes for cleaning my son in the morning.
__label__pos	I use them with warm water  (or camomile and jojoba oil which I make and put in a little spray bottle) and wipe his face, hands and toes and then throw them in the wash and so far they are holding out nicely with the every day use.
__label__pos	They are very soft and seems to last very nicely.
__label__pos	Super good for taking on the road to clean faces and hands with a little water or camomile/jojoba oil mix  (wipes can cause allergy and often contain perfume and should really never be used on baby's face).
__label__pos	I like this bedding set.
__label__pos	Our baby loves the animals.
__label__neu	We also got the mobile, the lamp, and the wall hangings.
__label__pos	It's great for a boy or a girl, so you will get lots of use out of it.
__label__pos	The colors are nice and neutral, but cheerful enough for a baby's room!
__label__pos	A great bedding set all around.
__label__neg	The comforter part is kind of impractical, but great as a decoration.
__label__pos	This set really is great.
__label__neu	It has 4 9oz bottles, slow flow (number 2) nipples, 4 sealing disks, 4 travel nipple bases, and a newborn pacifier.
__label__pos	This, combined with a 3pk of 4oz bottles makes a a great start to infant feeding.
__label__pos	It will also save you some money because you won't need to buy the Breast Milk Storage kit.
__label__neg	At first we didn't think our little one liked this, but with persistance, we have been successful.
__label__pos	He really enjoys it now.
__label__pos	Works great when you need a minute to cook supper, clean something or fold clothes.
__label__neu	He has even fallen asleep once in it.
__label__neu	you can also attach links with toys the the bar for something for a little one to play with.
__label__pos	This has been a very useful and helpful item in our house.
__label__pos	Great quality, very comfortable.
__label__pos	Highly recommend.
__label__neu	I received this as a gift.
__label__neu	I didn't use it until my daughter was 5 months.
__label__pos	It's wonderful!
__label__pos	While you would never leave a child unattended - it does provide a great deal of support.
__label__pos	I have a hard time getting my daughter out of the bath - she just loves being in there!
__label__pos	I highly recommend this item!
__label__neg	The first crib they shipped me was damaged in the shipment, so I asked them to ship another one.
__label__neg	the second one was also damaged.
__label__neu	I was able to take pieces from both to make a useable one.
__label__pos	It is a great crib!
__label__neg	It folds up and can be rolled on it's wheels even when folded.
__label__pos	It can be assembled very quickly.
__label__pos	So I rate the item very high, but check out your product when you receive it because the FedEx guys really beat ours up!
__label__pos	I just had my second baby and am still using my original Isis breast pump that I used with my first child four years ago.
__label__neu	I only pump occasionally so I don't know about using it for expressing many bottles.
__label__pos	For what I have used it for it has been great and is very easy to use and clean.
__label__neu	I am able to get a 4-6 oz.
__label__neu	bottle in 10-15 min.
__label__pos	and the Isis is very comfortable to use.
__label__neg	I use mine with the disposable system and freeze milk for whenever I need it.
__label__pos	The best tip that I got when I was pregnant was to get a Boppy.
__label__neu	Then, if you have a vaginal birth.
__label__neu	SIT ON IT!
__label__neu	Sure enough, I did and I did!
__label__pos	It was so much better than the pillow that the hospital gave me for the same purpose.
__label__pos	Yes, it is also good for feeding the baby.
__label__pos	And it is wonderful when baby is three months or so and wants to be propped up a bit to see that ever-expanding world.
__label__pos	After trying several pacifiers including the binky, my 2 month old loved the soothie.
__label__pos	While other pacifiers seemed to allow air to be sucked in, the soothie makes a tight seal.
__label__pos	I also love that there is no nipple air pocket that seems to look grungy very quickly.
__label__neg	The only change I would make would be an smaller attachment system.
__label__neg	I have avoided buying the attachment because it looks so big!
__label__neu	I might give it a try.
__label__neg	I do NOT understand why anyone likes the Boppy for nursing.
__label__neg	I am a pretty small woman (about a size 8) and I found that the donut-hole in the middle was so small it buckled in the front when I tried to put it around my waist.
__label__neg	Not only that, but it really needs to sit around the hips in order to be low enough to rest the baby on -- and that never worked, it just kept riding up to my waist.
__label__neg	And because it's so round and puffy, I had to use just as much muscle to keep my baby from rolling away from me as I would have to hold him up!
__label__neu	I tossed it in the closet and used regular bed and couch pillows instead.
__label__neg	Also, I couldn't use it in any chair with arms (like a rocker or a dining-table chair because the big fat arms of the Boppy got in the way of the arms of the chair.
__label__pos	I borrowed this breast pump from my sister and it is awesome!
__label__neu	This is my third child and I have breastfeed all three.
__label__pos	I have tried them all and this one is great.
__label__pos	The one-hand squeeze handle allows me to do other things while pumping!
__label__pos	I am only expressing twice a day so it is easy to clean!
__label__pos	What a great investment.
__label__pos	This is a cute chair, it must be comfortable, because my grandson will sit on it for quite a while.
__label__pos	Its versatile, can go on the real toilet and be used as a step stool.
__label__neu	(my grandson likes to stand on it to peek out the window).
__label__neu	It plays tunes when peed in, although as the baby soon figured out, if you bounce up and down hard enough, it will play, diluting the reward feature.
__label__pos	I am happy with it.
__label__neg	The only other disadvantage of this potty is that the seat area is a little small, and you have to be careful that boys don't scrape their weenies when sitting or getting up from this chair.
__label__neg	I am not rating this very highly because my daughter's head still flopped around quite a lot when I used it because babies' car seats have them sitting almost upright even as newborns.
__label__neg	This didn't help her head from going side to side or even forward.
__label__neu	Also, my car seat came with one.
__label__pos	What a terrific invention!
__label__pos	We give our daughter all sorts of foods in these cups (Cheerios, Veggie Booty, Cheddar Bunnies, etc) and the innovative lids really help keep the mess to a minimum.
__label__neu	Now that isn't to say we never have to clean Cheerios out of her carseat or stroller, because we definitely do!
__label__pos	"Still, she is by no means ready for a baggie or an open container, so without these containers she wouldn't be able to ""snack on the go."
__label__pos	"""My daughter is almost 19 months old and cannot get the lid off the cup, but I have heard of children who can."
__label__neu	I think my child is too interested in the food to spend time wondering about the lid!
__label__neu	When I was searching for a mobile for my daughter's crib, I wanted something that would be gender generic and cute.
__label__pos	This mobile provides adorable rainforest animals that actually face down so my daughter does not have to simply look at animal bottoms.
__label__pos	The music is a nice variety, and the little glow from the picture on the base is pleasant.
__label__pos	The remote to turn on and off the mobile seems like a nice convenience, but I haven't used it except to test it.
__label__neg	Very very cute bottle but it has a huge flaw.
__label__neu	I was instructed by my pediatrician to boil all nursing items for 20 minutes due to my daughter having recurring Thrush.
__label__neu	I put this nurser in with other bottles my daughter had used that day because she touched the bottle repeatedly during feedings after having her hands in Thrush infested mouth.
__label__neg	This nurser shrunk like a shrinky-dink!
__label__neg	It shrunk to about 1/4 of it normal size.
__label__neg	Strangest thing I have ever seen.
__label__neg	Do not use/purchase this nurser/bottle if you boil your bottles to sterilize them due to you or your child being sick.
__label__neu	This toy gets my son's attention.
__label__pos	The music and the lights are a perfect combo.
__label__neu	When he throws tantrums or get restless.
__label__pos	it always gets his attention.
__label__pos	I love it.
__label__neu	My daughter got this when she was 3 and at 4 years old she still rides it all over the place, it spins in circles, sideways, back and forth.
__label__pos	its so awesome.
__label__pos	Every kid that comes over hops on it and goes for a ride.
__label__pos	It's truly one of the best toys I've ever bought her, we're getting the smaller one for our 1 year old as well.
__label__pos	I can't wait!
__label__pos	I recommend this to everyone I know, totally worth the $$!
__label__pos	I like that this garment is flame resistant, that it is spacious and sleeveless, but that's about it.
__label__neg	The fabric has an unpleasant feel and the zipper began to break after only one use.
__label__neg	It continually splits from the wrong end, so every time the baby wakes up, she's come out of it.
__label__neg	I regret this purchase.
__label__neu	I make my own baby food and I got both the freezer trays and the travel dish, so that I can pack food for my little guy to take to daycare.
__label__pos	It worked out great.
__label__pos	The food fits from the freezer trays right into this dish, so every night I popped them out of the trays and into the travel dish and put them in the refrigerator.
__label__neu	They defrosted overnight and my little one had food for daycare the next day.
__label__pos	Having the spoon right there was great too.
__label__pos	I highly recommend Sophie-- our son loves her!
__label__pos	He smiles every time we hand her to him.
__label__pos	She has many surfaces that are great for chewing (and he chews a lot): feet, ears, neck and face.
__label__pos	She's very durable and easy to keep clean.
__label__pos	The high contrast spots are visually appealing.
__label__pos	And it's nice that it's natural rubber.
__label__neu	This reminds me of a product that might have been around when we were little, which is refreshing nowadays with the plethora of battery-driven, light-up toys, etc.
__label__neu	I bought this for my son when he was 2 and a half before we took a trip that would have us visiting a couple of hotels in a couple of different cities with my in-laws.
__label__pos	Two years later it has been used so many times I can't even count.
__label__pos	My son LOVES it still and I wouldn't replace this purchase for anything.
__label__pos	I highly recommend it.
__label__neu	I agree with many of the other reviews .
__label__pos	there is no need for a pricey bathtub, this one works fantastic!
__label__pos	The 3 stages of this tub (newborn, infant and toddler) will make it a useful item for a long time.
__label__pos	The sling feature is perfect for newborns.
__label__pos	The non skid pads in the infant side are a great feature, and the high angled back is very supportive.
__label__pos	The tub is a great size -- not too large to store and fits in most standard sinks (I have a 1 1/2 size sink).
__label__neu	We've moved into the upstairs bathtub, and I just place this inside the tub while our little guy kicks and splashes.
__label__pos	At 26 inches he still fits nicely in the infant side -- we have not yet moved to the deeper seated end for toddlers yet.
__label__neu	We may just move to a tub seat when he can sit well enough.
__label__pos	This is a great tub and a great value for the price.
__label__pos	I know many people who bought this and not one has complained about it.
__label__pos	My daughter loved it from day one (it was the only way we could get her to sleep at night for the first 2 weeks!).
__label__pos	The music and fish are fun for the baby to play with also.
__label__pos	I like that you can choose which was it'll swing (side to side or front to back) as each baby is different in their preferences!
__label__neu	I bought this for my son when he was 3 months old.
__label__pos	I love how easy it is for him to grasp the rings and skinny bar in the middle.
__label__neu	The clear side of the rattle has a spinner in it with three different sides:  a bullseye, a ladybug, and a mirror.
__label__pos	I love twirling the spinner for my son.
__label__pos	It's very relaxing to watch - almost hypnotic.
__label__pos	This toy reminds me of the kind of stuff I had and loved as a baby.
__label__pos	In the age of overstimulating toys, this one earns five stars from our family for being super inexpensive, captivating, and simple.
__label__neg	Bulky bulky bulky.
__label__neu	Other reviewers said it as well.
__label__neu	This holds the soothie, but so will any other paci clip with a string loop at the end, like the booginhead one (nothing special there).
__label__neg	The clip is unnecessarily bulky, as is the part that attaches to the binky.
__label__neg	Not a favorite.
__label__pos	We prefer the wubbanub pacifier.
__label__pos	It doesn't attach to anything but it's definitely the best!
__label__pos	My two cents about this fantastically designed mobile by the Tiny Love folks: our two-month old gets &quot;hipnotized&quot; by the figures SO MUCH, that the truth is he stops noticing anything else aruond him.
__label__pos	This is why the remote is not that big of a deal: he doesn't really mind if you come in or out of the room, and as a matter of fact, he even loves the mobile if it's stopped.
__label__pos	As for the figures, they are very colorful and well designed too.
__label__pos	and the elephant is just too funny, twisting like crazy because of his extra weight).
__label__pos	All in all, a highly recommended mobile (any Tiny Love), but if you want to save a few bucks ($10 I think it is), skip the Deluxe version and get the regular one.
__label__neg	We HAD a Diaper Genie, it's a total waste of money and plastic.
__label__neg	The Diaper Genie was so hard to use and didn't do anything to stop odors.
__label__neg	My son's room smelled as if we threw the dirty diapers in an open garbage.
__label__neg	"And the fact that you have to buy their ""special bags"" added insult to injury."
__label__neu	We replaced it with THE FIRST YEARS CLEAN AIR DIAPER DISPOSAL SYSTEM.
__label__pos	It's so much more effective and easy to use than the Diaper Genie, and you use your own tall kitchen garbage bags.
__label__pos	The greatest thing about The First Years Clean Air Systen is that it can store about 6-7 days of my son's diapers without NO yucky odors.
__label__neu	WOW!
__label__pos	We love this product so much.
__label__pos	Our son's room smells clean with no poopy odors, and we save money by using our own tall kitchen bags.
__label__pos	It's also very easy to change--no confusing bag twisting.
__label__neg	STAY AWAY FROM THE DIAPER GENIE.
__label__neg	You'll just end up having to replace it because your baby's room will stink terribly.
__label__pos	I really love having the mirror!
__label__pos	We didn't get it until my son was 6 months or so, but I'm getting my money's worth now.
__label__neu	I don't know about the projectile thing.
__label__neu	ours secured to the tether at the top of the headrest, but if we get into that bad of a crash, I'm sure window glass, or something, would be more of a hazard.
__label__pos	I recommend it.
__label__neu	I couldn't see spending a ton of money on a carried being my son was growing super quick.
__label__neu	So, I splurged and bought this carrier.
__label__pos	I was so pleased with it, I bought another one to keep in my Mother-In-law's car so I always had it handy.
__label__pos	It was cheap enough that I could actually do that!
__label__neu	I never wore it on my back.
__label__pos	I want even aware that you could, but I loved being able to see my angel and hug him all the time.
__label__pos	Both my husband who is a foot taller then I and myself both enjoyed using this and it worked great.
__label__pos	My son loved being in it as well.
__label__neg	I wish it went higher up on the weight though since my son grew so rapidly.
__label__pos	I thought this mobile was very entertaining to my boy.
__label__pos	it was a little expensive but worth the price.
__label__pos	After he was old enough to pull it that they say to not have mobiles anymore, I took the whole toy apart and we played with all it's pieces and the music box separately for many months.
__label__pos	This is a great seat for the money.
__label__neg	Honestly, I don't see the point in buying a more expensive one.
__label__neu	HOWEVER: when the music/vibration unit at the bottom of the seat is removed, the metal rack it attaches to sticks out, right in the path of my son's little feet.
__label__neg	He hits his heels on it all the time (we removed it since he we never really used it).
__label__pos	He has since trained himself to not put his feet near it (he got little bruises on his heels), and other than that he loves this seat.
__label__neu	We even broke it down and took it with us on vacation.
__label__pos	The fabric in the seat is very easy to wash and the colors haven't faded at all.
__label__pos	Great seat, with one minor flaw.
__label__pos	I love these snack cups!
__label__neu	we have a dog who is always hounding my daughter for her snacks.
__label__neu	with these cups she can drop it and they dog doesn't get all the contents!
__label__neu	I was very excited to get my son this cup to drink out of.
__label__neu	I thought it would keep his drinks cold in the summer and be easy for him to use.
__label__neg	I am very disappointed.
__label__neg	The cup's parts do pull apart for easy cleaning but the spout is very hard to get back into the lid and almost impossible to line up exactly right.
__label__neg	I am not sure if it is because of this that the cup leaks.
__label__neg	After messing around with the lid for a good 10 minutes and thinking that it was on good; the cup *still* leaked.
__label__neu	I am not talking about leaking from my 15 month old throwing the cup around either.
__label__neg	We had this cup sitting in the cup holder in his stroller and 5 minutes of movement from the stroller (at the zoo) caused it to leak out a puddle of milk into the cup holder.
__label__neg	We ended up having to throw out the remainder of the milk and beg some napkins from a zoo snack stand attendant to sop up the mess.
__label__neg	I am really frustrated that this cup leaks with even normal (not toddler like) use.
__label__neg	"The fact that ""leak-proof"" is in the title is really ironic."
__label__neg	In summary:Pros- Keeps things cold- Easy to cleanCons- Hard to pop the spout back in- Leaks very easy (we are talking that it leaks while sitting in the stroller.
__label__neg	)- Really, really leaks!
__label__neu	My Sister used this tub when she was in her apartment.
__label__neg	they bearly used it.
__label__neu	its gently used and well they liked it in there apartment but he out grew it to quicky!
__label__pos	its a good buy if you have a small house/apartment!
__label__pos	we liked it for the first few time he got a bath.
__label__pos	once he out grew the tub he was placed in the big boy bath tub and he loves it!
__label__pos	and he loves to splash water every where and there's no one to keep him in this toddler tub its a great buy.
__label__pos	and we loved it at the beginning of  his bath times!
__label__pos	great crib, easy to assemble (it was pretty much assembled when it arrived!)
__label__pos	My 6 month old son who is almost 20 pounds fits well in it, but I had to double wrap a bumper pad around it so he wouldn't roll into the cold metal!
__label__pos	I am not sure how long he will fit into it, but I love its portability and how I feel there is no rush to move my happy 2 yr old out of his crib.
__label__pos	And its overall best feature is how you can roll it from room to room without taking it apart.
__label__pos	This is a GREAT product.
__label__pos	My son plays with it all the time, and chews on it when he gets the urge.
__label__pos	I was a little surprised at it's size (a bit smaller than expected) but when I realized my little one could hold it with one hand (or two) and hold onto furniture to walk with the other, I couldn't have been more pleased!
__label__pos	It's definitely NOT too small, it's the perfect size for a toddlers small hands.
__label__pos	I love this chair.
__label__pos	It is so easy to use and the tray slides easily with one hand.
__label__pos	(A big bonus when dealing with a wiggling baby.)
__label__pos	It is easy to clean and I like how well the chair pad has come through the wash.
__label__pos	Highly recommended!
__label__neu	I was looking for an easier baby sling (currently use the Moby) and thought this would be a good option.
__label__pos	The material is nice and light, excellent quality, and the baby blue with navy stitching is a lovely color.
__label__neg	However, it just doesn't match up to the Moby.
__label__neg	I never felt like my baby was truely secure in his spot while in the Ktan.
__label__pos	Though the Moby takes a bit of trial and error to get the wrapping down pat, it has a pannel you can pull over the baby which secures everything in place.
__label__neg	The Ktan is missing this last piece.
__label__neg	You also have to buy the correct size so if you and your partner are different sizes, you have to buy two.
__label__pos	The Moby is one long peice of fabric that both my husband and I can use so we only have to carry one sling with us when we're out and can EASILY switch it back and forth between us.
__label__pos	We have several of these in various sizes and fabrics.
__label__pos	They are all terrific.
__label__pos	We're using the fleece at night in the winter, the quilt during the day in winter and we used the cotton one in the Fall.
__label__pos	I highly recommend this line of wearable blankets!
__label__neu	Be wary of any diaper pail that requires instructions and a demo by your next-door-neighbor in order to use it!
__label__neg	After I figured it all out I found that it was a pain to fool with.
__label__neg	Also the refills are expensive and it doesn't hold enough diapers IMO.
__label__neg	It doesn't lock out odors either.
__label__neg	It may have for the first week or two, but now at 3 1/2 months it SMELLS BAD.
__label__neg	I guess the diapers have gotten stinkier.
__label__neg	What can I say.
__label__neg	The other thing that drives me nuts is that the first few diapers I put in after a refill change never go in correctly.
__label__neg	No matter how many times I twist after the first diaper, the second one always pushes right through the first twist and ends up hanging in the bottom - un-sausage-linked.
__label__pos	The only positive thing I can say is that when you do cut the links loose they are easy to dispose of in the outside garbage.
__label__neg	You may want to save your money on this one and go with something less fru-fru.
__label__pos	"I read someone elses review that says ""couldn't have taken a shower without it"", all I have to say to that is, hallelujah!"
__label__pos	Everyday for months I put this thing in the bathroom in front of our wall mirror, my son loved it.
__label__pos	Between playing with all the toys and smiling/talking to himslef in the mirror, I could once again take a shower that lastest more than 2 minute, and even put on some make-up and brush my hair.
__label__pos	And just like the other mom said, put them in this with the Baby Einstein on and you've got yourself one life saving baby cocktail!
__label__pos	My son loves it and I couldn't get very much done without it!
__label__neu	Although now that he's 8 months and very mobile, he doesn't like it so much anymore, he'd rather be free to chase the dogs and throw the dvd's all over the house.

__label__neu	Yes, yes, I read Karp's Happiest Baby on the Block, and yes, I believe that swaddling itself is the miracle-not this blanket.
__label__pos	I had a few swaddlers from First YearsThe First Years Easy-Wrap Swaddler - Yellow (much cheaper and worked better), but my son outgrew them.
__label__neu	So, I decided to try the Miracle Blanket.
__label__neg	I wish I hadn't spent the money.
__label__neg	First, the price is very high.
__label__neg	Second, it's a long blanket that wraps--there are no closures (velcro, snaps, etc), so he tends to slip down into the blanket, and the arm flaps bunch up in his armpits (uncomfortable).
__label__neg	What's worse, the blanket unravels and wraps around his neck.
__label__neg	Scary!
__label__neg	He gets very hot in this blanket (despite central A/C and ceiling fan--his back and neck are drenched!
__label__neg	), and overheating is another risk factor for SIDS.
__label__neg	"Oh, and forget about ""quick"" middle-of-the-night diaper changes--it's nearly impossible to get his legs out of the bottom pouch, so wrestling him out of the blanket wakes him up."
__label__neg	Overall, I would not recommend this blanket.
__label__neg	These locks did not install quickly, my husband had a difficult time aligning the separate pieces in a way that allowed the magnets to operate properly.
__label__neg	One of the drawers won't close unless I press hard on the direct spot where the lock is located.
__label__neg	Another issue is the magnet 'key' which I wouldn't have known to order had I not read it in a previous review.
__label__neu	If you don't order the four pack of locks you must order the key separately!
__label__neg	Overall, a lot of fuss and we end up leaving them unlocked because they are a nuisance.
__label__neu	I bought this for my son a couple of years ago.
__label__neu	We used it lots when we were out, especially when he was potty training and just couldn't wait.
__label__pos	It's wonderful.
__label__neg	Just wish it was easier to find the liners.
__label__neu	Another reviewer said there are sharp edges.
__label__pos	Ours doesn't have any sharp edges.
__label__neu	It does collapse, if the legs aren't snapped up properly; but otherwise isn't a problem.
__label__neu	Our daughter is potty training right now and we have it ready for her whenever she needs it.
__label__pos	It will also be great for our upcoming car trip.
__label__neu	UPDATE:My daughter is now 5 years old.
__label__pos	We've had this for so many years and it's saved us many times.
__label__neu	We still have this in the back of the car for those rare emergencies.
__label__pos	What a wonderful buy.
__label__pos	This monitor is excellent!
__label__pos	we have little interferance with other equipment (my hubby is a geek and we have it all!
__label__pos	wireless router, phones, tvs, etc) the sound is good and there is not much noise.
__label__neu	BUt having our girl in the next door room does not justify having the monitor.
__label__neu	So, unless your house is HUGE, or you sleep in the second floor while the baby is in the first one (or backwards) use your money in diapers!
__label__pos	This is a great item to help your child strengthen their legs, plus the added bonus of wearing them out before nap time!
__label__pos	The look of joy on their little faces, once they figure out how to jump, is the greatest thing ever!
__label__pos	Just get one of these (actually, I got two so I wouldn't have to keep moving it around so much.)
__label__neu	At 2 months, our baby's head was getting awfully flat.
__label__neu	"Enough so that the pediatrician scheduled an appt at 3 months to look at it & possibly talk about ""the helmet."""
__label__neu	I freaked & ran to our local BRU that same day.
__label__neu	I used it in the swing, the activity rocker, the bouncer & in her stroller, but not her car seat.
__label__neu	I also let her (danger danger! )
__label__neu	sleep on it at occassional naps.
__label__neu	If I was sitting in my bed reading, I'd lay her next to me on her noggin nest for a nap.
__label__neu	(Nothing dangerous there.)
__label__neu	I wouldn't let her sleep on it at night, or anytime she wouldn't be constantly supervised.
__label__pos	At any rate, by 3 months, the doctor said she had improved immensely, we'd just keep an eye on it.
__label__pos	We kept using it & at 4 months, he said we didn't even need to worry about it anymore.
__label__neu	I used it for a few more weeks after that, until she started turning her head a lot more at night & started sitting up.
__label__neu	Now I only use it in her activity rocker as a pillow because she likes.
__label__pos	She's 5 1/2 months now and has a beautiful round head!
__label__pos	I can not recommend this highly enough!
__label__pos	This is an excellent diaper pail!
__label__pos	It looks and works like a regular trash can - just step on the foot pedal and drop the diaper in.
__label__neu	No twisting or other fancy maneuvers necessary.
__label__pos	The refills are very simple to replace and when it's time to empty the pail, all you do is cut the bag, tie a knot and you're done!
__label__pos	Although it is small, it holds a ton of diapers -- so far we only have to empty it about once a week.
__label__neg	The refills are a little pricey, but a 3-pack lasts several months.
__label__pos	You definitely want this one on your registry!
__label__pos	LOVE this for our little girl.
__label__pos	She enjoys bouncing around and loves that she can turn all the way around in the chair to play with all the toys but also to face Mommy and Daddy when they walk to a different part of the room or into the kitchen.
__label__pos	I work from home and this has been wonderful for entertaining her while I'm working.
__label__pos	Great purchase, easy to assemble, worth every penny.
__label__pos	We love Kiddopotamus products and this one is no exception.
__label__neu	We don't use this anymore because my daughter is a toddler but we used it since the day my daughter was born and we brought her home from the hospital.
__label__pos	No slouching, very comfy and cozy - a definite must buy for any baby shower.
__label__neu	(In fact I've bought quite a few for friends having babies.)
__label__pos	AWESOME.
__label__pos	Yeah Kiddopotamus!
__label__pos	My 5 1/2 month old loves this new toy.
__label__pos	Oslo, the dog is her new favorite chew thing.
__label__pos	She likes pulling apart the panels of the box.
__label__pos	She likes chewing the flaps and looking in the mirror.
__label__neu	I can fit in a few more of her favorite soft rattles and pack the box in her diaper bag for trips out.
__label__pos	She can be entertained indefinitely with this.
__label__pos	the best feature is the sling.
__label__pos	it holds a newborn perfectly.
__label__pos	my baby likes to hang one foot off the side and dip it in the warm water.
__label__pos	there is a place that holds shampoo/baby wash. i'll be using this when my baby is a toddler too.
__label__pos	another great feature is it has a groove in the back, where you can use it in a sink, or lean it against something to dry.
__label__neu	it has a drain too.
__label__neu	i don't use that though, because i put the tub on the floor.
__label__pos	it's the best tub, and very affordable!
__label__neu	We received this as a gift and love it!
__label__neu	It warms the wipes nicely.
__label__neg	When we use unwarmed wipes my baby gets more upset at changes.
__label__neu	Perhaps we are spoiling him.
__label__pos	;-) He is a winter baby so I'm sure he appreicates our efforts to keep his tushy warm.
__label__neu	The only time I have had problems with wipes drying out is when I have over filled it and the lid doesn't close tightly or I have accidently left it open.
__label__neu	When that happens, I have just added a bit of water and it restores them nicely.
__label__neu	I found that the bottom wipe does turn brown but only when I keep adding the fresh wipes to the top and the bottom ones were older.
__label__neu	Now I remove the whole remaining stack and add new ones to the bottom.
__label__neu	Even if they are slightly brown, it just looks weird.
__label__pos	I'm pretty sure the wipes are just fine.
__label__neg	I do wish that it came with a pop-up adapter or something.
__label__neu	I like the Pamper's pop-up wipes but find it difficult to pull one out because they are inner-folded and stick together.
__label__neu	It works better with the Huggies wipes.
__label__neg	The only other issue is that the lid collects condensed water and I am afraid of it leaving a puddle on our furniture.
__label__neu	So, I place it on a folded face towel and that seems to work.
__label__pos	Overall despite the few minor issues mentioned I am very pleased with this product.
__label__neu	A relative purchased the Baby Einstein Play Gym for my daughter when she was one month old.
__label__neu	Being a sleep-deprived first time mother, I was not sure she would even need such an item.
__label__neu	Two weeks after receiving the gym I opened it, put batteries in the musical star, and arranged all the  toys on the bar according to the directions.
__label__neu	I placed my daughter on the colorful mat with her feet on the bar.
__label__neu	She sat there for a moment, kicked the bar, activing the musical star.
__label__pos	Then, in a moment I will remember for the rest of my life, she smiled for the first time.
__label__neu	It did not take her long to figure out that kicking the bar would make the star play a song for her.
__label__pos	She loved this toy for many months (until she learned to crawl).
__label__pos	This is a wonderful toy for young babies.
__label__pos	Some of the toys rattle, and the bright primary colors easily attract a baby's attention.
__label__pos	My daughter especially enjoyed looking at the ladybug.
__label__pos	The star is detatachable and made many trips to Grandma's house with us to place in her pack and play.
__label__pos	I washed the mat in the washing machine and dried it on gentle many time without any problems.
__label__pos	I hope this information is helpful to anyone deciding which play gym to chose for thier baby.
__label__pos	You can purchase this item without any fear of buyer's remorse.
__label__pos	We love the 50s style designs, and these are very very soft for catching and wiping up spitup, and they stand up to heavy duty washing.
__label__pos	This adapter and plug cover works very well.
__label__neu	We had this in my son's room from when he was a toddler to cover an monitor adapter that would have been easily accessible to him.
__label__pos	He was very curious about plugs and outlets, but he never got into this cover.
__label__pos	It's easily installed and it gives adults easy access to the adapter.
__label__neu	The size adjusts lengthwise and is large enough to fit the majority of adaptors.
__label__neu	As with all childproof products, don't let your kids see how it's done.
__label__pos	This was the most useful gift we received for our baby.
__label__neu	At a very young age, my son has exhibited the strong need to explore and see different things.
__label__neu	Since he can't crawl yet, it's imperative that he be carried around so he'll be entertained.
__label__pos	Enter the Bjorn, a must have in my book.
__label__pos	Pros: Easy to use, easy to clean, offers great support for baby's back and neck.
__label__neu	Some reviews noted it offers little or no back support for the person carrying the baby.
__label__neg	Our little one is over 20 lbs now and I still use this more than our jogger when hiking.
__label__neu	My shoulders feel sore, but my back felt good with some minor adjustment on the lumbar support.
__label__neg	Con: I wished the front panel was expandable.
__label__neg	My baby is a bit, uhm, round in the middle, and on times when it's cold outside and he has a sweater on, the front panel becomes harder to hook in.
__label__pos	This is a great addition to our already wonderful Uppababy stroller.
__label__pos	When our little one falls asleep in the car, it's easy to snap into the stroller, click her car seat on and go.
__label__pos	It clicks on tightly and holds the car seat firmly in place.
__label__pos	It's light weight and super easy to attach.
__label__pos	Great purchase, highly recommend it as an addition to your Uppababy stroller.
__label__pos	I bought these bottles after reading reviews on them and have been pretty happy with them.
__label__neu	They have never leaked with me BUT I have never screwed the lid on too tightly.
__label__neg	You HAVE to remember that.
__label__neg	When you overtighten the lid, the nipple gets distorted and the seal is broken.
__label__neg	My husband and others in the family have had this problem.
__label__neu	It is probably always helpful to test for leaks (when you test the temp of the milk) BEFORE you give it to the baby, just to make sure.
__label__pos	I like the plastic they use.
__label__pos	It has always felt extremely sturdy.
__label__pos	They are easily to hold (thanks to the curve) and I really like the wide mouth of the bottles which make them easy to clean.
__label__pos	and you are pretty sure they are clean!
__label__pos	I bought the newborn starter set and the infant set and together they are all I require for bottles and a breastmilk storage set!
__label__pos	I really like dthat you get the brush, pacifier and two sizes of bottle in the newborn set.
__label__pos	Made my life easy.
__label__pos	All in all I think they were a great buy and worth it.
__label__pos	I would use them all over again and would use avent with my next baby too.
__label__neg	We couldn't get the sheet on right.
__label__neg	It kept lifting the corners of the floor mat.
__label__neg	They weren't soft like the others either.
__label__neg	We never used them.
__label__neu	You can find ours at Goodwill.
__label__neg	Waste of money.
__label__neu	I bought these bottles for my baby who is a big spitter.
__label__neg	They haven't helped at all, and one of them leaks like crazy all over the place.
__label__neg	I will be calling Playtex to request a refund.
__label__pos	These bottles are lightweight so they are perfect for travel.
__label__neg	Perhaps the bottles don't need to be perfectly sterile for the baby, but I'm still hesitant to approach these as completely sterilized.
__label__neg	They bottles are sterile in the pack they come in, but once you open them, then what.
__label__neu	The fact that they are recyclable is a bonus, but these bottles are incredibly pricey ($1/bottle) to be used daily at every feeding.
__label__neu	I bought this seat when I was pregnant with my second child because I couln't pick up my toddler anymore and because I wanted him to be seated while eating.
__label__pos	I used to put it on the floor an he liked it right away.
__label__pos	Now I am attaching it to a chair and he loves it either way.
__label__pos	I don't know what I would've done with out it!
__label__pos	Love this mirror!
__label__pos	My daughter still loves this mirror at 19 months old.
__label__pos	She didn't use it too much for tummy time but I loved the idea of the sturdy block holding it up as opposed to some of the folding tummy time mirrors that just tip over.
__label__pos	I took it off the block, I used the velcro straps on the back of it (that hold it to the block), to put it in her crib and she absolutely loves having it there.
__label__pos	Every time she wakes up, she talks to herself in the mirror and just plays.
__label__pos	It's so cute.
__label__pos	No frills mirror, but it has been fabulous for my daughter!
__label__pos	I like the colors too, just like all the lamaze toys' colors!
__label__neu	We actually didn't buy our bundle me until February so we won't get as much use out of it as we could have if he'd been born in the fall.
__label__neg	But we got sick of putting him in a snowsuit or covering him with 3 or 4 blankets.
__label__pos	This is a great product.
__label__neu	It kept him warm (sometimes too warm) and was easy to get him in and out of.
__label__pos	Once it got too warm for his carseat I put it in his Graco Quattro Tour and he loves it.
__label__pos	He stays all nice and warm.
__label__neu	But unfortunately I think we are now done with it unless we have a new baby or maybe for the fall in the stroller.
__label__neu	But he is growing very fast and may be too long then.
__label__pos	I got this from our shower and even though I never nursed, I still found this boppy very helpful.
__label__pos	After holding a baby for so long, your arm gets numb so I used this pillow to just hold my baby and still rest my arms.
__label__neu	I also use this pillow for tummy time.
__label__neg	My baby hates laying flat on his belly so I plop him on this belly down so he could still work out his neck muscles.
__label__pos	I've also used this as a prop to hold my baby up to take picturs.
__label__pos	It's great, even if you're not nursing!
__label__pos	My 2 month old daughter LOVES Jacques.
__label__pos	"She holds onto his ""feathers"" and loves the noise the crinkle noise makes."
__label__neu	We attached him onto her carseat so  she can play with him while we travel.
__label__pos	She loves to stare at his bold colors.
__label__neu	We also turn him around so she views the back of Jacques, which is all black and white patterns.
__label__pos	Jacques is such a good friend to my daughter.
__label__pos	My foster son has terrible reflux, and these bottles have made a definite improvement for him.
__label__pos	They are great!
__label__neu	After my Medela Harmony suddonly quit working, I was in a rush for a new pump and ended up getting the Avent Isis.
__label__pos	At first I thought I had purchased a dud, but after a few minutes the pump grabbed on big time, and I was expressing milk faster than I ever had with the Harmony.
__label__neu	"I do find that this pump works better for me when I remove the rubber ""petal"" lining."
__label__neg	And this pump can be squeeky.
__label__neg	The most frustrating thing for me though is that after using it for a little over a month the little white disk would pop out of place, just when I would get a really strong suction going.
__label__neg	Then I would have to stop and take the pump apart to get the disk back in position.
__label__neg	Also, the wide bottles don't fit very well in the bottle compartment of my diaper bag, and my daughter is not use to the wide nipples.
__label__neg	I use the Avent bottles to store milk, but I use the Medela bottles for feeding, which is kind of hassle compared to being able to pump directly into the feeding bottle.
__label__neu	I put this diaper bag on my baby registry and someone bought it for the shower.
__label__neg	By the way it looked online, i thought it was a small one day diaper bag, but it was bigger.
__label__pos	This was a good thing.
__label__neu	Being that my hubby's family lives in New Jersey we were able to pack clothes for the baby for two days or more.
__label__pos	I love the material and the design goes great with the stroller and all our other baby things.
__label__neu	We have a toddler and we were told that we just had to get a guard for the DVD, and for other electronic things as well.
__label__neu	It seems that babies like to push buttons.
__label__neu	Well, that figures.
__label__neu	Our boy has been trained with a bunch of musical toys that require button punching and he learned rather quickly.
__label__pos	He loves them!
__label__neu	It's only a matter of time before he gets to the stereo, TV and DVD player, hence we bought this Parent Units DVD/CD guard.
__label__neg	I'm annoyed by this product.
__label__neg	It's just a piece of transparent plastic with a couple small velcro straps yet it cost 20% that of the very sophisticated DVD/CD player.
__label__neg	What goes?
__label__neg	Second, if we use it as illustrated, we will have to remove the guard before each using in order to get the little disc drawer to open.
__label__neg	Furthermore, our DVD player is on a small shelf and we cannot remove the guard without removing the DVD player from the shelf first.
__label__neg	What a nuisance!
__label__neu	I've gotten around this by using the guard upside down.
__label__neu	The long flange of the plastic goes under the front legs of the DVD player and the short flange then covers the controls.
__label__neg	OK, but we still have to remove the guard before each using of the player It's an annoyance.
__label__neu	We're considering putting the DVD player at a higher level out of his reach.
__label__neu	Gary Peterson
__label__neu	I bought these bottles to replace our Avent bottles, due to BPA concerns.
__label__neu	These bottles are ok, but I like Dr. Brown's better.
__label__pos	I use a Medela breast pump and the Born-Free bottles, like the Avent bottles, do not fit on the pump.
__label__neu	The Dr. Brown's bottles do fit the Medela pump connectors.
__label__neg	Like other reviewers have stated, the nipples on these bottles collapses and there are extra parts that seem useless, just more stuff to clean.
__label__neu	It is easier for my son to hold the Dr. Brown's bottles also.
__label__neg	I would not recommend these, there are far better bottles out there, we also use Momo glass bottles, and I am very pleased with them.
__label__neu	I use these bottles and avent bottles (i have an avent pump)and noticed that with the avent bottles my milk had a horrible amount of bubbles.
__label__neu	These ones have NO BUBBLES!
__label__pos	which means its probably better feeling for baby!
__label__pos	The size one flow is perfect for my son.
__label__neu	He burps as soon as you sit him up (this might just be because he is a fast burper?
__label__neu	every baby is different) and he has spit up only twice.
__label__neu	(He is one week old)The only problem I have is that I cannot find an adapter that will fit my avent pump and fit these bottles to pump directly into them which makes the avent bottles a little more convenient with breastmilk and playtex doesnt make a hand pump.
__label__pos	When I decide to stop pumping I'll definitely give him these bottles exclusively.
__label__pos	These were a huge help getting started on my first baby.
__label__pos	I bought them on a whim and boy was a glad.
__label__pos	They help get my milk started because they apply a light pressure which also helps extent the nipple.
__label__pos	They keep things (such as a bra) from rubbing against very very sore nipples.
__label__pos	Another great feature is the air vents at the top of the cups.
__label__neu	They are there to get air to nipple, (you don't want them getting dried out, that just makes the pain of feeding much worse).
__label__pos	Determined breastfeeding mom's these are fantastic until your milk supply comes in at a steady pace.
__label__neu	They do not look flattering under a TIGHT fitting shirt (loose is always best anyways) but what does when you are breastfeeding for the first few months as things are adjusting.
__label__pos	I felt that they looked better that two huge wet spots from leakage.
__label__neu	I have tried numerous baby spoons.
__label__pos	I like these the best.
__label__pos	They are soft, pliable and easy to use.
__label__neu	Also, dishwasher safe, which is a must in my house.
__label__neu	I purchased this so we could have our daughter's handprint for her very first Christmas.
__label__pos	It is INCREDIBLY easy to do!
__label__pos	The best part is that if you make a mistake or you are not happy with how the print came out you can redo it.
__label__neu	I am not sure what this is made of, but it smells like marshmallows.
__label__neu	It is smooth and soft and you roll it out using the roller included with the kit.
__label__neu	I should mention that the material stuck to the wooden roller that came with the kit and the directions state that if this happens, to use a round tin can.
__label__pos	That worked for me!
__label__neg	The other thing I had trouble with was the plastic ring that came with the kit; I just used a bowl.
__label__neg	You do have to push a bit hard to make a solid impression in the material.
__label__neu	A straw is included to make the holes at the top for the ribbon.
__label__neu	I used a toothpick and pin-pricked the year at the bottom.
__label__pos	It came out beautiful!
__label__pos	I highly recommend this kit for parents and to make those one-of-a-kind keepsake gifts.
__label__neu	When our son started escaping from the receiving blankets we'd swaddle him in, we started using a sleep sack.
__label__pos	It took a couple of weeks for him to adjust to it, but now he loves it and goes right to sleep when we put it on him and set him in the crib.
__label__neu	He is 30 inches tall and about to outgrow the medium, so we have a large ready for him.
__label__neu	He rolls all over the crib during the night and the sleep sack moves with him.
__label__pos	It is never pulled tight or twisted.
__label__neu	"We dress him in something with long sleeves so that his arms stay warm and during the colder winter nights we added ""No-Scratch Mittens"" from Babies R Us to keep his hands warm."
__label__pos	When our son was still in a bassinet, the sleep sack worked well with a sleep positioner to keep him on his back.
__label__pos	When swaddled he would scoot out of the positioner, but with the sleep sack his arms were above the positioner and he stayed in place.
__label__pos	I've washed both a cotton and a fleece sleep sack dozens of times and they held up great.
__label__pos	There's no shrinking, fading or unraveling and the zippers still work perfectly.
__label__pos	The sleep sack is the perfect way for our son to stay warm at night and I am so glad I have it.
__label__pos	We love this thermos and our toddler son does too.
__label__pos	Doesn't leak and keeps liquid hot or cold.
__label__neg	Just VERY hard to find.
__label__neu	I've been waiting 2 months for a new one.
__label__pos	This is an absolutely wonderful product.
__label__pos	Out of all the products we bought, this one is my favorite.
__label__pos	When our little one was newborn, it was easy and quick to swaddle her which made it nice.
__label__pos	Now that she is a little older and can wiggle out of the blanket swaddle, it's great because it has velcro closures so it keeps her snog all night and I don't have to worry about her wiggling free and having loose blankets in the crib with her.
__label__pos	I would get a couple sizes so you can continue to use them as you little one grows.
__label__neu	Our pediatrician said it was okay to swaddle up to 4 months.
__label__pos	"I was going to get the ""spindle"" changing table from POttery Barn Kids but found this one, at about 1/3rd of the price."
__label__pos	This one is even better b/c of the rail that goes around the actual changing area.
__label__neu	i do recommend a contoured changing pad with a comfy cover.
__label__neu	i have attached a crib mobile to this table to keep katie happy during diaper time.
__label__pos	this changing table looks good in her room, i also bought the Jenny Lind crib.
__label__neu	i did get the baskets from PBK to store stuff neatly on the shelves.
__label__neu	The only complaint that i have is that the shelves are basically hard cardboard, but dont let that discourage you b/c they really are sturdy and as i mentioned i've got baskets on the shelves so you really dont notice.
__label__neg	"I bought this teether hoping to avoid the ubiquitous ""made in China"" plasticware that most teethers are."
__label__neg	I think I had higher hopes for it.
__label__neu	My daughter likes it ok, but it is definitely not her favorite chew toy- she likes her Sophie Giraffe much more.
__label__neu	It is easy for her to grip and it's very smooth- no splinters, after 4 months- but maybe it's just not her thing.
__label__pos	But it's well made and once in a while she will gnaw on it for a bit.
__label__neu	Some babies will love it, but she tends to want something slightly softer- cold wash cloths do the trick often, as does the aforementioned rubber giraffe.
__label__neu	It's hit or miss but I don't regret trying.
__label__neu	I am a new mother with a 4 month year old.
__label__pos	We used to have our bottles just dry on a cloth, but this drying rack saves space and makes sterilising so much easier!
__label__pos	A must-have for those bottle feeding their babies.
__label__neg	This product is poorly designed.
__label__neg	There's a rubber insert on the flat side which you're supposed to press against your child's head to make a seal so the water only flows back from that point.
__label__neg	Two problems: first, the rubber is so rigid you can't get a good seal without pressing REALLY hard.
__label__neg	The second, and biggest, problem is that the rubber insert doesn't go all the way to the edges of the cup.
__label__neu	There is a space of about 3mm at each side where the water just gushes out.
__label__neu	Because of where you'd have the cup positioned on your child's head, this means the water goes in their ears, down both sides of their face and even some into the eyes.
__label__neg	Since it's water in the eyes which really freaks my kid out, it's useless to us.
__label__pos	She does enjoy stuffing her other bath toys in it though so we have got some use out of it.
__label__pos	Easy to install, easy to operate.
__label__neu	Spring tension seems about as heavy as it could be to dissuade small fingers without making it too hard for an adult to operate.
__label__neg	Slides do not bind, and while they add a small thickness of plastic between the plug and outlet, do not prevent secure insertion of the plug.
__label__neu	Bulk pack came with several foam inserts to put behind plates on drafty walls.
__label__neu	The foam wasn't pre-punched with holes for the mounting screws - trying poke the screws through and insert resulted in foam twisting around screws, so it was necessary to use a hole punch to make holes in the foam.
__label__pos	but hey, I wasn't even expecting the foam pieces at all.
__label__pos	I really like this thermometer.
__label__neu	I my research before purchasing a thermometer before my baby was born.
__label__pos	This thermometer works much better and quicker than the hospital thermometers I recieved.
__label__pos	I can actually wear jewelry again!
__label__pos	Great product, baby loves it, and my sister-in-law mistook it for a family heirloom.
__label__neu	(Although I have purchased two others for friends and don't think this would happen with all the colors.)
__label__neu	The clasp is kind of rinky-dink, but serves the purpose for when it gets pulled on by baby.
__label__pos	Sure, real jewelry is better, but in the meantime, this is great!
__label__pos	Worth the price for peace of mind re: safety.
__label__pos	Baby loves it, small and light enough for her to grasp and squeeze.
__label__pos	It's not flimsy to me at all.
__label__pos	Maybe because the carpeting in our apartment stabalizes it, but it's perfect.
__label__pos	I also think it's very pretty - it brightened up the room.
__label__pos	I just love it.
__label__neu	Makes me want to further decorate the room for the baby.
__label__pos	Perfect height for me as well and plenty of storage room.
__label__neu	I do wish the pad furnished was a bit thicker and softer but it's sufficient.
__label__pos	I like how it's covered in smooth vinyl so we can clean it very easily.
__label__pos	Great table for a great price!
__label__neu	For the most part I really haven't had any problems with it.
__label__neu	It is pin drop quiet.
__label__neu	I can turn it to the voice dial only and block out any other background noise.
__label__neu	I live in the subarbs and don't really get to much interference if any.
__label__neu	I did notice that when I went with it to the city (NYC), cell phones used in the same room as the receiver caused static - but once they were off it was fine.
__label__pos	I like that I can also detach it from the plug and walk around with it on from room to room as it works on the backup battery - very helpful when your trying to get a quick shower.
__label__neu	One thing I'd like to mention is not to have the 2 pieces close to each other - they create a high pitch sound or begin to alarm that they are out of range of each other.
__label__neu	But since the purpose of them is to be in seperate rooms it shouldn't really matter to much.
__label__pos	I recommend it.
__label__pos	This bowl is cute and difficult for my daughter to lift and throw.
__label__neu	However, if your high chair has a smaller tray, this bowl will not fit.
__label__neg	For example, we have theFisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat - Blue, and the bowl does not fit on the tray - it is too large for the tray.
__label__neu	I searched for weeks for a decent bedding set for my 2.5 year old.
__label__neu	"She wanted to pick out a new set of bedding for her ""big toddler bed."
__label__neg	"""We went to all of the major retailers, and I was shocked at the terrible quality of the bedding--the sheets with characters (Lightning McQueen, Thomas the Tank Engine, Dora) were consistently made of sheets that were see-through and felt like plastic or sandpaper."
__label__pos	These sheets are wonderful!
__label__pos	I am so pleased!
__label__pos	They are soft, smooth, and I love that the flat sheet and comforter have one fitted end, which keeps the bedding on my daughter while she sleeps.
__label__pos	The comforter is light but is quite warm, even for my daughter, whose bed is near a window.
__label__pos	I'll probably toss a throw on her when it gets colder, but for a primary comforter it's perfect.
__label__pos	This is one of the few balls that's safe to throw in the house and a younger toddler and his older sister can have fun sharing.
__label__pos	My daughter sits on it sometimes (she's almost 4), and it's not flat after 3 years.
__label__pos	"My 13 month old son loved the tags when he was younger, now he loves playing ""catch""."
__label__neu	well, he can throw the ball, we're still working on the catching.
__label__pos	I don't have to worry about my 4 year old hurting him with this.
__label__pos	I am a pretty frugal person, but this was worth the splurge 3 years ago.
__label__pos	It has held up well and washes up well.
__label__neu	I gave it a 4 star rating for educational because at this age motor skills are a significant aspect of their learning.
__label__pos	It's a basic toy, but a good one.
__label__pos	Love it, love it, love it!
__label__pos	I love that you can use regular plastic bags and don't need to buy refills for it.
__label__neu	Once in a great while it will stink a bit but only when I used too big of a bag and have a LOT of diapers in there.
__label__pos	Wipes up nice and clean with antibacterial wipes.
__label__pos	My daughter is starting potty training and I'm still using it.
__label__pos	Great buy!
__label__pos	My daughter loves this cup for one distinct reason: She can fling water around on every surface in the house and then slurp it up!
__label__neu	I love that it's BPA free and it's easy to drink from, but it just leaks too much.
__label__pos	Another cool feature is that you can have the handles on, or not.
__label__neu	I bought this because my daughter has hated the pack n play from day one.
__label__neg	She is now 13 months old and it was a major battle at each travel destination.
__label__neu	When we decided to leave her with grandma for a few nights we knew we needed a crib.
__label__pos	This one is great because it is very sturdy.
__label__pos	The folding locks take a bit of getting used to, but they work well.
__label__neu	The mattress is thin and we purchased a mattress for it for about $20.
__label__pos	I bought portable crib sheets at Babies R Us and they work great.
__label__pos	My daughter sleeps in this like her regular crib and I think we will get a lot of use from it!
__label__neu	It does fold nice and flat, but it is still large for the average car.
__label__neu	We can put it in our Suburban.
__label__pos	It would be nice if they made one that has sides that fold in half for storage, but no one does!
__label__pos	I love this crib.
__label__pos	My wife chose Avent on recommendation from a friend and we glad we did.
__label__pos	These bottles worked perfectly for us.
__label__pos	They also fit right into Avent bottle warmer, which we also have.
__label__neu	We bought this swing for our son when he was 2 months old.
__label__pos	He has loved it ever since.
__label__pos	It puts him to sleep when mommy has something to get done, he will look at himself in the mirror, he loves the music, and he watches his Baby Einstein videos while in it.
__label__pos	It has served so many purposes.
__label__pos	You will love it.
__label__pos	Don't wait to get it though, you'll be sorry.
__label__pos	It also easy to fold up and move from room to room and up and down steps.
__label__neu	I was looking for a tub with an infant sling.
__label__neu	I chose this tub because the sling holds infants up to 16 pounds.
__label__neu	My baby was born 8 pounds and at 11 weeks is already 15 pounds.
__label__pos	The sling feature has really come in handy (especially for newborns) in giving my infant a bath.
__label__pos	It suspends him and lets soapy water pass through as i rinse him off making for a safer, faster, cleaner rinse.
__label__pos	I have now transitioned him to the tub with out the sling and the erogonomic design and non slip back pad, really keep him in place comfortably.
__label__pos	Of all the tubs i researched, this was also one of the biggest which will transition well when he can sit up.
__label__pos	This tub has really made bathing a lot easier and enjoyable for both my baby and I.
__label__pos	Love, love, love this swing as does my infant child.
__label__pos	Keeps him so content.
__label__pos	Really like that it swings sideways as well as back and forth.
__label__neu	Wouldn't it be nice if the fears of solid feeding could be alleviated?
__label__neu	How much would you pay to have some safeguard against your little one choking as they learn to eat new foods?
__label__neu	Wouldn't it be nice if there were something better than those refrigeratable rings to sooth sore, teething gums?
__label__pos	Now there is.
__label__neu	After having a small choking incident, which I was able to react quickly to, I bought this to relieve some of my fears.
__label__pos	I had heard good things about this product but this is something you HAVE to experience for yourself.
__label__pos	I found it so nice to be able to offer my daughter bananas, grapes, potatoes, and so much more without having to worry about her taking in to big of a piece and choking.
__label__pos	With the baby safe feeder, your child knaws or sucks on the mesh and the food is dispensed in small quantities that are safe to be swalled by little mouths.
__label__pos	I loved this item even more when teething time came around.
__label__pos	I could drop one or two ice cubes in the bag and my daughter would be on cloud nine.
__label__pos	She never cared for those teething rings or other teething toys, this was it for us.
__label__pos	She would hold onto the handle and suck cube uppon cube of ice until her pains were relieved.
__label__pos	I think every parent should own one of these, it is inexpensive and well worth the money.
__label__neu	We have tried the Swaddle Me, the Swaddle Blanket, and the Miracle Blanket.
__label__pos	The ONLY one our daughter (now two - she used it for about 3 months) and now our 2 month old son does not break out of is the Miracle Blanket.
__label__pos	"ADVANTAGES* Works differently than others - holds arms at side with two ""flaps"" that tuck under the body (uses body weight), and then a longer piece wraps around the baby."
__label__pos	The end result is a very tight but comfortable looking coocoon that works!
__label__neg	*  NO VELCRO - The velcro on the Swaddle Me kept waking our daughter up!
__label__pos	*  Keeps them warm with nothing else required.
__label__neg	DISADVANTAGES*  The part that swaddles the bottom half of the body sometimes come loose - you have to make sure that you wrap the blanket around the lower half o the body REALLY well!
__label__neu	*  Nothing else we can think of
__label__pos	Friend loved this item!
__label__pos	We bought it off their registry as a gift, they love it.
__label__pos	I love that special pricey bags or refills are not needed with this diaper pail.
__label__neu	It does a pretty decent job of keeping out the smell, but with how stinky my son's poos are, I still tie poopy diapers in a plastic shopping bag before putting it in the pail (also keeps from getting yucky stuff of my hands when I push it into the pail).
__label__neu	I do wish that this was hands-free like my other pail, but it works much better on smell.
__label__neu	If you want to completely eliminate diaper odors you'll have to take each diaper out of the house immediately.
__label__pos	This is an EXCELLENT bath tub for my 3 week old.
__label__neu	We put in the Safer Bather and fill the tub with our detachable shower head and bath time is soooo simple.
__label__neu	Just remember to cork the plug at the bottom of the tub.
__label__pos	SO for you mom's looking for a tub for your infant this is the one, just don't forget to buy the safer bather to go along with it.
__label__pos	this will keep you from having to hold the baby while bathing her, just lean her back into the cushion and wash with BOTH HANDS!
__label__neu	Note: I didn't buy this tub to fit into my kitchen sink.
__label__neu	Use it as a mini bath tub that can fit on a diningroom table, in your regular sized tub or on the floor.
__label__neu	since I only have a stand up shower I put it on the floor of the shower and use my detachable shower head.
__label__pos	It works GREAT!
__label__neu	I am a first time mother.
__label__neu	One thing that I have learned is never to pick something beacause you like the pattern.
__label__pos	I love the Windsor pattern, so I figured I would register for all of the items in Windsor print.
__label__neu	I recevied them all.
__label__neg	The item I like the least is the swing.
__label__neg	It wasn't exactly easy to put together.
__label__neg	The mobile was the hardest part.
__label__neg	Once you think you get it on, it just keeps falling off.
__label__neg	I got so aggravated, I just gave up and kept the mobile off.
__label__neu	When my six month old son falls asleep his head always ends up falling to the side or in his lap, no matter how far it is reclined and even with the head insert in.
__label__neg	It sure isn't a quiet swing, it makes a clicking noise everytime it goes back and forth.
__label__neg	It goes through batteries like crazy.
__label__neu	My son has learned to unhook the tray and when he does he just about falls out.
__label__neg	I'm not happy with it at all.
__label__neg	The only reason I gave it two stars is because the pattern is very nice.
__label__pos	I went and bought the linkadoos take along swing, which I love and am completely satisfied with.
__label__neu	Never register for an item or buy an item just because you like the pattern and want a matching set, you may end up with something you hate :)
__label__pos	My daughter is almost 5 months and has been playing in this gym for a few months now.
__label__pos	She loves it!
__label__pos	The mirror mesmerizes her and she loves pulling at the toys.
__label__neu	My only complaint - the music has to be restarted too often!
__label__neu	This bouncer is ok.
__label__pos	When my baby was younger and I couldn't get him to go to sleep I would put him in this bouncer with the vibration on & it would put him right to sleep.
__label__neu	Now that he is 4 months old he wont sleep in it and wont stay in it very long.
__label__neg	It is boring.
__label__neg	There are no lights or upbeat songs.
__label__neg	There is nothing going on with it, nothing happening, nothing exciting.
__label__neg	I wish that there were more lights, along the sides, top, etc.
__label__neu	and more activites.
__label__neu	My baby always got out of his swaddle blankets and I tried them all, including this one which he also can get out of.
__label__neu	BUT I found a solution that works.
__label__pos	If I use this blanket with the Koddpotamus & Co 100% Cotton Knit SwaddleMe Blanket he stays swaddled all night!
__label__pos	Amazing.
__label__pos	So for those of you who are desperate to have you babies stayed swaddled and nothing is working, try this and the other swaddle blanket I mentioned together.
__label__neu	Put this one on first and then the other one on over top.
__label__neu	I leave the legs out because it's the arms that cause the waking.
__label__neu	Ths reason I give this blanket 4 stars is because it doesn't work without the other swaddle blanket on top.
__label__pos	This swing has been fabulous.
__label__pos	Since our baby was born, we have puthim in it to soothe him and it has beengreat watching him swing and grow into it.
__label__pos	It's brought lots of smiles and glee for babyand a breather for the parents.
__label__pos	Our baby is 12 months old now and can stillswing in it.
__label__pos	These days, I put him in it in the morningto watch a Baby Einstein DVD and he loves it.
__label__pos	He's loved to watch the lights come on and off andhas loved the fish mobile.
__label__pos	We have enjoyed having the differentspeed settings and have never had trouble with strange motor sounds coming from the mobile.
__label__pos	For us, it's been great!
__label__neg	I have tried five different types of bottles and these are horrible.
__label__neg	Don't waste your money.
__label__neu	Dr. Brown's is the way to go!
__label__neu	I dropped one of my caps on the ground and snapped the part off that the tube goes over.
__label__pos	Due to that I decided to order several extras and was glad to see that they cost less than $1 each.
__label__neu	These are the exact caps that came with my pump, so I have no complaints other than I wish Ameda made them a bit sturdier.
__label__neu	Alright, so these really do a great job of keeping out the sun, but boy are they ugly.
__label__neg	I had a hard time putting them up straight and keeping out the bubbles.
__label__neu	Make sure your windows are not cold when you apply them, otherwise they won't stick.
__label__neu	I like them because, like I said, they kept the sun out of my son's eyes, but they are an eyesore.
__label__neu	At least from the inside of the car.
__label__neu	Maybe that's my fault, I don't know.
__label__neg	I wish they could make these like real static cling that you can dip into water then squeegee them onto the window.
__label__neg	Also, be careful when you look behind you, when you change lanes.
__label__neg	These darken the windows a lot and it is sometimes difficult to see through.
__label__neu	We have a the NoJo Jungle Babies 6-piece crib set as well as the wall stickers and these hangings.
__label__pos	The hangings are great for the nursery with interesting characters, great colors, and a mixture of fabrics for depth and texture.
__label__pos	They are made from the same materials as the comforter so match perfectly.
__label__pos	They can be thrown in the washing machine when they get too dusty and hold up well.
__label__neg	These pads are terrible.
__label__neg	I used the Avent disposables which are the absolute best,  so I thought their washables would be good as well.
__label__neg	Well that was a big mistake.
__label__neg	They curve outward instead of following the natural curve of the breast, making them visible under any type of shirt or sweater.
__label__neu	I figured I could use them when I was home.
__label__neg	Then I got tired of changing clothes from all the leaks I experienced.
__label__neg	These pads don't absorb much at all.
__label__neg	What I was saving on disposables, I was wasting on detergent and time.
__label__pos	This is a great swing and my daughter loves it.
__label__pos	She likes to look at the moving birds and leaves at the top.
__label__pos	I love that you can change swinging directions.
__label__pos	Worth every penny!
__label__pos	This mattress pad fits my Graco pack n play perfectly.
__label__pos	I especially like how it makes the pack n play seem a little more comfortable without compromising safety.
__label__neu	It has 2 layers, the cotton quilted layer and a separate VINYL waterproof layer.
__label__neu	I would have preferred a polyurethane waterproofing, but this mattress pad does a good job and appears to be of good quality so far.
__label__pos	I purchased this item before a family vacation and it is a very helpful tool.
__label__pos	You simply press the timer for a diaper change, feeding, and for sleep.
__label__neu	There's also a fourth timer of your choice.
__label__pos	It has a clock, a light, a backlight to see the numbers in the dark, and even a little reminder at the bottom for which side you last breastfed from.
__label__pos	While we still like to write down times to keep track, I really like having the Itzbeen.
__label__pos	It's nice to look at it and quickly see how long they have been sleeping, etc.
__label__neu	The only thing is that sometimes it's just easier to note the time if you don't have the Itzbeen with you.
__label__neu	You can't input a time, they are just timers.
__label__neu	In any case, it certainly doesn't hurt to have an extra tool around.
__label__pos	I think it would have really been helpful those first few weeks!

__label__neg	"""The only complaints are the price and when the baby is an infant, even the slowest speed is fast for an infant."""
__label__neu	"""We would have to push it by hand every so often to give the swing a slower pace."""
__label__pos	"""My husband and I love this bag."""
__label__pos	"""It's great for quick trips and everyday use."""
__label__pos	"""The side pockets are perfect for personal stuff and baby's bottles AND mom's water."""
__label__pos	"""It also has the best changing pad with pockets where you can stick wipes."""
__label__neu	"""We use one for baby wipes and one for anti bacterial hand wipes."""
__label__pos	"""My husband doesn't mind carrying this bag..."""
__label__pos	"""and he's really picky."""
__label__pos	"""We love this tub and so does our daughter!"""
__label__pos	"""I read the reviews on this and we are so glad we recieved this as a gift."""
__label__pos	"""The tub has been great since she was a newborn, and weighed in at 7 lbs."""
__label__neu	"""11 oz."""
__label__pos	"""She fits great in the contoured area and the water level is sufficient to keep her warm and happy during bathtime."""
__label__neu	"""We originally bought one of the sponge teddy bear pads to put her on inside the tub, but found it unecessary and uncomfortable for her because she was now out of the water too much."""
__label__neu	"""Instead to make the plastic where she lays a little comfier we put in a hand towel to lay on."""
__label__pos	"""We are extremely happy with this tub and would have rated it five stars, except for the fact that it is HUGE."""
__label__neg	"""It is very hard to find anywhere to store this monstrous tub after the bath when it is damp."""
__label__pos	"""That said, the fact that it is so big allows two parents to enjoy giving the bath together to the little one, and allows for the deepness of the water a tradeoff you'll have to decide on."""
__label__pos	"""Love this frame!"""
__label__pos	"""It is a very nice quality and color, it is not cheap or childish in any way."""
__label__pos	"""It comes with labels to insert under the sonogram photo."""
__label__pos	"""We've been referring to our little guy as our ""Bun"", and there was even a label included ""bun in the oven""."""
__label__pos	"""Perfect!"""
__label__pos	"""The labels included are in blue, pink, and a neutral (I'm not sure if this was in the product description, but here it is again)."""
__label__pos	"""This product was very easy to use and required very little effort."""
__label__pos	"""The instructions are clear and are helpful (I noticed a review that a woman rolled the dough too thin, but the directions clearly say not to."""
__label__neu	"""Maybe they have altered the directions to help alleviate any problems since she purchased hers)."""
__label__pos	"""I too had enough left over to make a handprint which I was happy about :)  I am so glad to have this keepsake of my baby's adorable little foot."""
__label__neu	"""Well, I donated this swing to the nearest Salvation Army a while back.."""
__label__neu	"""but I'm just now catching up on reviews...."""
__label__pos	"""we LOVED it!"""
__label__pos	"""It had great music and sound options and the seating was very comfortable and flexible!"""
__label__pos	"""I put both my 2 boys in it and it was a sanity saver!"""
__label__pos	"""You will not go wrong buying this swing!"""
__label__pos	"""It is wonderful!"""
__label__pos	"""Buy this one!"""
__label__pos	"""It is the best!"""
__label__pos	"""I tried 2 other tubs before I got this one."""
__label__pos	"""And it is awesome."""
__label__pos	"""Comfortable for mother and baby."""
__label__pos	"""It goes on your sink, so you don't have to bend down to bathe your baby."""
__label__pos	"""The sling feature is wonderful for when your little one is still a little one."""
__label__pos	"""But you can still use the tub without the sling when they get bigger."""
__label__neu	"""I used mine up to when my son was 10 months."""
__label__pos	"""I can't be more passionate about this tub."""
__label__pos	"""Buy this one!"""
__label__pos	"""This carrier definitely is easy on the back and shoulders!!"""
__label__pos	"""I felt like I could carry my son around for hours, unlike the Bjorn where after 15 minutes I was dieing."""
__label__neg	"""HOWEVER, my son is too used to the Bjorn where he faces out and did not like the Ergo AT ALL - he tried turning around the whole time."""
__label__neg	"""And there was NO WAY I could put him on my back alone - I needed the help from my husband to put him on my back - and unfortunately, I am alone with my son most of the time so I could never put him on alone."""
__label__pos	"""This is an awesome carrier if you have a newborn or a child that is already used to facing inwards."""
__label__neg	"""This monitor was terrible."""
__label__neg	"""Even with the volume turned all the way up we couldn't hear our baby- Sometimes he would cry and we would hear him from the other room but the monitor wasn't registering it."""
__label__neu	"""We exchanged it for a Fisher Price Aquarium Monitor- also terrible, a real waste of money."""
__label__neg	"""We now have the Fisher Price 900 mhz and it is THE BEST monitor!"""
__label__neu	"""We have a 14 mo."""
__label__neu	"""old daughter and a 3 mo."""
__label__neu	"""old son- we love this monitor so much that we bought it for both kids."""
__label__neu	"""It is so sensitive we can even hear the babies breathing- the reception is crystal clear."""
__label__neg	"""Don't waste your money on this one- buy the Fisher Price 900 mhz."""
__label__pos	"""These packs convert easily from warm to cold."""
__label__pos	"""They fit inside my nursing bra (at home, too bulky to wear in public)."""
__label__neg	"""But the edges are very sharp so placement is key when nipples are sore."""
__label__neu	"""Keeping them in my fridge for those times when I get behind in pumping."""
__label__neu	"""i dint have a leaking issue with these but they didn't stay in place well."""
__label__neg	"""the one little strip of adhesive was not enough to keep them in place."""
__label__neg	"""Maybe it is b/c I am big breasted but these did not work (loved the Avent ones though)"""
__label__pos	"""I love this diaper Champ."""
__label__pos	"""I got it as a shower gift and hadent heard of it before but when I started using it I had to tell all my friends."""
__label__pos	"""This will definatly be my gift of choice from now on to all my pregnant friends."""
__label__neg	"""As other reviews say the smell isnt that great when it gets full but its not that bad (I see it as a hint the bag is full and its time to change)."""
__label__neu	"""I also spray the inside w/ febreeze or lysol disinfectant during each change and that nips the problem in the bud."""
__label__pos	"""Overall, Its one of those things that I cant live without but didnt know it until I got it."""
__label__pos	"""I love this bag!"""
__label__pos	"""There is plenty of room in it to fit all my little one's stuff (and I like to overpack)."""
__label__pos	"""I really like the plastic pouch inside."""
__label__pos	"""It has come in handy several times when she has had accidents and we need somewhere to put wet clothes."""
__label__neg	"""At first I wondered why the strap had velcro on it."""
__label__pos	"""I was excited to discover that you can unclip and unvelcro it and attach it to the handle of your stroller!"""
__label__pos	"""This is my favorite thing about the bag!"""
__label__pos	"""It is very comfortable to carry too."""
__label__pos	"""I am so glad I picked it because it is great!"""
__label__pos	"""At first I thought these would be a dud, but as my son has gotten older, he has started enjoying them more."""
__label__neu	"""He is now 5 months and plays with them by kicking them and picking them up, holding and turning them."""
__label__pos	"""The large shape is, I think, helping him learn how to grasp better."""
__label__pos	"""He also likes the sounds they make and the different textures."""
__label__neg	"""They are very light, though, so it is easy for him to kick or knock them out of his reach (he is not to mobile yet)."""
__label__neg	"""I bought this mat for my infant son's playroom, it comes apart easily and the pieces don't fit tightly."""
__label__neg	"""My son pulls the connector pieces out all the time and chews on them, which is a bit unsanitary."""
__label__neu	"""One of my cats has taken to clawing at the mat also which is starting to ruin it."""
__label__neg	"""I am overall very disappointed with the wear..."""
__label__neg	"""I called Skip Hop for tips and they recommended sending an email, I did, and they NEVER replied."""
__label__neu	"""The one thing that would make this mat better is a stiffer rubber because the design is so adorable."""
__label__pos	"""My son has loved this bouncer since he was just a couple of weeks old."""
__label__pos	"""The fish really keep his attention."""
__label__pos	"""I love the fact that you can play music, water sounds, and wave sounds."""
__label__pos	"""It keeps him interested."""
__label__pos	"""He is only 2 months, so he is not old enough to bounce it, yet."""
__label__pos	"""It helps me a lot when I have to take a shower of do laundry."""
__label__pos	"""I can place him in the room with me and not worry that he will not be entertained!"""
__label__pos	"""My daughter likes her froggy..."""
__label__neg	"""I only wish the pacifier was not sewn in so I could switch it out when it falls on the floor without a waterfountain in site (having four or five froggys in an already crammed diaper bag isn't practical)."""
__label__pos	"""This is my 3rd monitor that i have bought, and I LOVED it until yesterday when for some reason it just stopped working ( i have had it right around a year)."""
__label__pos	"""It has good sound quality, picks up the smallest noises, which is good and bad depending on how soundly you sleep :-)The feature that i like best, (which is actually why i am buying another one now that mine is broken)is that it has 2 ON settings."""
__label__pos	"""One has the monitor on and the other is sound activated."""
__label__pos	"""The reason i love this is that we have white noise makers in my sons room and the monitor obviously picks it up, but because it is a constant sound it doesn't stay on when on the sound activated setting."""
__label__pos	"""It is great for us because the white noise keeps me up so i don't like to hear it through the monitor."""
__label__pos	"""All in all a great product and i have and will continue to recomend it to anyone who will listen!!!"""
__label__pos	"""I've tried a few different kinds of sippy cups, and this is the only kind my 9 month old son will drink from."""
__label__pos	"""He really likes the soft spout."""
__label__pos	"""Others we've tried claim to have a soft spout, but they don't compare to this one."""
__label__pos	"""These cups are money well spent!"""
__label__neu	"""I found this blanket on a babycenter store and decided to purchase it from here because of the free shipping."""
__label__pos	"""I got it fast and I loved it!"""
__label__pos	"""It looks like an expensive bag and when you open it , it is a big blanket which is very soft inside and waterproof outside."""
__label__pos	"""it is easy to wash and carry around!"""
__label__pos	"""It is a very nice blanket and we love to go for a pick nick or just relax on teh nature with our baby."""
__label__pos	"""These bibs are nice, they do their job but smill like tires."""
__label__neg	"""The smell wears off a bit after a few washes but still kinda there."""
__label__pos	"""I would buy these again and would recommend them to a friend."""
__label__pos	"""Good quality!"""
__label__neg	"""We had this product less than a year before we switched to the diaper champ."""
__label__pos	"""It was fine at first before we fed our baby to solids."""
__label__neg	"""The smell would leak out."""
__label__neu	"""We clean the diaper genie every week."""
__label__neu	"""Maybe the reason the smell was quite strong was becuase we just use it for the BM diapers and regulars trash can for the other diapers that way we would not have to constanly buy refills."""
__label__neu	"""It's not a bad prouduct, I suggest emptying it out daily."""
__label__neg	"""I would strongly reccommend buying the diaper champ keeps out the smell."""
__label__pos	"""Out of 3 that we bought, this is the most comfortable one."""
__label__pos	"""It's adjustable."""
__label__pos	"""Stors easy and it has a SHOWER!"""
__label__pos	"""Our daughter loves in it."""
__label__pos	"""The water level is great."""
__label__pos	"""There is plenty of room for her to splash in."""
__label__neu	"""This is the second one I bought."""
__label__pos	"""It keeps oder out really well until it starts to get full."""
__label__pos	"""Very easy to use and refill."""
__label__pos	"""This swing has been a lifesaver, and I LOVE the cradle or swing option, which is great for parents whose babies may like only one or the other (this prevents parents from having to buy a second swing if baby doesn't like the way the first one rocks)."""
__label__neg	"""The only complaint--the music plays and the mobile turns for only about 7 minutes, and then you have to hit the reset button."""
__label__neg	"""I don't know about you, but it's a bit annoying to have to go over to the swing all the time to hit the button repeatedly..."""
__label__pos	"""These are perfect for when I don't want a really thick wash cloth for my baby."""
__label__pos	"""And they are fun because of the rainforest them."""
__label__pos	"""First baby view mirror I have bought, but after reading the reviews I decided to buy."""
__label__neu	"""I have had it for one day, and have installed it in my Prius."""
__label__pos	"""After a few attempts to fine tune the viewing angles so I could see the road behind me and my baby I found a good position."""
__label__pos	"""It secures well to the headrest, but I like that there are multiple ways to secure the mirror."""
__label__pos	"""The actual mirror surface is big and the mirror is convex."""
__label__pos	"""My 4 day old does look small in the mirror but I can see if she is awake or sleeping."""
__label__neg	"""Night time the mirror is useless unless I turn on the rear light, but that is not really necessary."""
__label__pos	"""The mirror is cute, fits well, has a method of adjusting the angle, and I can see my child."""
__label__pos	"""Therefor I am happy with this purchase."""
__label__neg	"""If it magnified it may be better..."""
__label__pos	"""This is a good product."""
__label__pos	"""My daughter is very laid back, knock on wood, but I thought this would be especially nice for those midnight diaper changes when she was young because it wouldn't wake her up as much as a cold wipe would, and it didn't."""
__label__pos	"""I also haven't had a single wipe turn brown, and the wipes have never dried out on me either even when I wasn't home to use them for over a week!"""
__label__pos	"""My daughter definately seems to like the warm wipes better as she doesn't ever flinch or cry like she will with the cold ones."""
__label__neu	"""Ok, I had sticker shock."""
__label__neg	"""Yes, my baby is worth the money for his safety, but was this really worth almost $100 more than the others?"""
__label__pos	"""Yep!"""
__label__neu	"""We bought a Britax and an Evenflo."""
__label__pos	"""Both are pretty in our cars and I guess I am shallow but I care about that."""
__label__pos	"""But by far the best part is that my son is a happy little camper in this seat."""
__label__pos	"""He fusses way more in the evenflo and just looks so uncomfortable while he is sleeping in it."""
__label__pos	"""In his Britax he almost never complains and just looks so comfortable."""
__label__pos	"""Straps are easy to adjust and not a lot of twisting."""
__label__pos	"""This is one product that definitely lives up to all of the hype!"""
__label__pos	"""I bought this wrap based on the praise it received."""
__label__neg	"""But I think it is way too expensive for what it is."""
__label__neg	"""It is also time consuming and cumbersome to put on."""
__label__neg	"""You do get the hang of it but it still takes time to get it just right and drags the floor in the process."""
__label__neg	"""Also my 18 month old didn't seem that safe in it."""
__label__neg	"""I felt like he was about to fall out all the time."""
__label__neg	"""And I wondered if the bunched material under his butt and back hurt him."""
__label__neg	"""It pulls up on your shirt so make sure you wear a long one!"""
__label__neg	"""And it left black looking fuzz all over my hands and clothes every time I touched it."""
__label__neg	"""I washed it several times and even lint rolled it and it still didn't help."""
__label__neg	"""It's also made of a thick t-shirt like material and made me and my son hot."""
__label__pos	"""The only thing about it I liked was that it didn't hurt my back or neck like other baby carriers."""
__label__neg	"""I am still on the search for the perfect baby carrier..."""
__label__pos	"""This is easy to ""install"" - and the protection is perfect."""
__label__pos	"""My son is 4 months old, and isn't using sunblock, so this has been a lifesaver!"""
__label__pos	"""We love it."""
__label__neg	"""The only con is that you have to untie it every single time you want to fold the stroller..."""
__label__neu	"""but really, what would the alternative be..."""
__label__pos	"""it's not like there is a stroller out there that can offer this much protection."""
__label__pos	"""Buy it - you'll love it!"""
__label__pos	"""I bought this way b4 my little one was born because I fell in love with the design and concept..."""
__label__pos	"""I couldn't wait to start solids on my bb...."""
__label__neg	"""then after she started solid, I somehow ""forgot"" about this item..."""
__label__neg	"""it remained in the drawer, unopened until last week when I came upon it again, and thought about returning it since I hadn't opened it, and I was concerned the bulky handy would be difficult to hold..."""
__label__pos	"""then I read all the wonderful reviews on it again and thought I'd give it a try."""
__label__pos	"""To my amazement, I fell in love with it all over again!"""
__label__pos	"""Everyone who saw me using it loved it too!"""
__label__pos	"""I got tons of complements when I take it out."""
__label__pos	"""It is very very easy and convenient, altho I do wish the spoon part could be made of a softer rubber and the cap could cover the back of the spoon as well instead of just the front."""
__label__neg	"""Since it only covers the front, I have to use a sandwich bag to wrap the entire mouth area to keep it clean in the diaper bag."""
__label__pos	"""Other than that this is definitely a great product; it holds an entire carton of gerber's stage 2 bb food!"""
__label__pos	"""Great for one feeding!"""
__label__pos	"""We love this toy."""
__label__pos	"""I got it for my 1st child when she was 6 months old and she loved it immediately."""
__label__pos	"""She stood in it and played with the toys at each spot - learned to walk and then to run around it."""
__label__neu	"""Once she was actually walking we pulled the seat off and left it as a playtable for her..."""
__label__pos	"""she constantly played with it."""
__label__pos	"""She loved having snack in the little snack tray and all her little friends that came to play always ran to the table..."""
__label__pos	"""now #2 is here and loves it just as much!"""
__label__pos	"""Its the same big hit the second time around!"""
__label__pos	"""Fabulous toy - worth the money - very durable."""
__label__pos	"""Easy to clean (except the keys in the piano part those are more difficult)."""
__label__pos	"""Good on carpet tile and hardwood."""
__label__pos	"""I just bought this bouncer for my 6-week old daughter 2 days ago and she absolutely loves it!!!"""
__label__neu	"""My daughter loves to be held and carried, as long as she is awake, she wants to be in someone's arms, needless to say I needed a break."""
__label__pos	"""After reading all of the reviews I purchased this bouncer."""
__label__neg	"""The 1st couple of times I put her in it she didn't seem all that interested."""
__label__pos	"""But the 3rd time was the charm!"""
__label__pos	"""She was fascinated by the spinning starfish and the bubbles."""
__label__pos	"""She cooed, smiled, and, for the 1st time, squealed while sitting in her bouncer."""
__label__pos	"""I know we are going to get our money's worth out of this bouncer."""
__label__pos	"""And as a side note: the bouncer was very easy to put together."""
__label__pos	"""It took me less than 5 minutes to set it up."""
__label__pos	"""this carseat is the only one i've tried that does not move AT ALL once installed, not even the allowed 1 inch."""
__label__pos	"""it is very easy to install with either seatbelt or LATCH (depending on your car)."""
__label__neu	"""my daughter outgrew her infant carseat at 7 months, so we had to get a convertible car seat."""
__label__neg	"""was worried about the price at first, but then reminded myself that you cannot put a price on your child's safety."""
__label__pos	"""i love how easy it is to install (5 minutes max, once you figure it out), how securely it fits in all 3 cars i've installed it in (camry, bmw, landrover), and how it looks."""
__label__pos	"""the cover is also very easy to take off when you want to wash it (no screwdrivers needed)."""
__label__pos	"""my daughter just loves how it feels."""
__label__pos	"""she rarely slept in her old carseat, but in this one she always falls asleep, and it looks so comfortable too (soft, padded and with armrest)."""
__label__pos	"""would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a convertible car seat or even a regular carseat."""
__label__pos	"""i will buy this one again when i have another baby."""
__label__pos	"""My baby is one month old and we love the eurobath!"""
__label__pos	"""It's spacious and comfortable, he likes being in the water, other bathtubs have a seat out of the water."""
__label__pos	"""It also has a plug on the bottom which makes it easy to empty."""
__label__pos	"""I love that it holds an older baby too."""
__label__neu	"""We orignially registered for and received the Diaper Genie and had problems with it from the day our son came home from the hospital."""
__label__neu	"""When he was three days old my husband took it back to the the store and announced that he was coming home with the Diaper Champ."""
__label__pos	"""We LOVE it!!!"""
__label__pos	"""The fact that it uses regular garbage bags is a huge advantage and we have never had any problems with the smell. . ."""
__label__pos	"""impressive considering some of the dirty diapers I have seen my son produce."""
__label__pos	"""He is now six months old and the Champ works as well as it did when we purchased it."""
__label__pos	"""In addition, it's very easy to use."""
__label__pos	"""Just flip the handle and the diapers fall through to the bag."""
__label__pos	"""Couldn't be simpler."""
__label__pos	"""We love this product so much that when I see people at the store looking at the Diaper Genie vs. the Champ I will go up to them and tell them to select the Diaper Champ."""
__label__neu	"""We bought the bottles to use with my son who is exclusively breastfed."""
__label__pos	"""I was honestly a little worried about switching between bottle and breast, but these have been great."""
__label__pos	"""The stage 1 nipples do a great job of mimicking the flow of breast milk."""
__label__neu	"""If you are using these with a breastfed baby, you don't need the Stage 2 nipples (breastmilk doesn't flow faster, so the nipples don't need to be changed)."""
__label__pos	"""They are also very easy to clean."""
__label__neg	"""The only negative I've found is that I can't buy them in an actual store; all of our have been ordered online."""
__label__neu	"""Update August 2012:  When my second son was born this summer, I re-evaluated the bottles that were available."""
__label__neu	"""We bought a set of Tommee Tippee bottles and a set of Avent bottles, neither style had been available when my oldest was born."""
__label__pos	"""After trying those, we ended up purchasing more Breastflow bottles as these caused the least amount of confusion and latch issues."""
__label__pos	"""We've not had the leaking trouble that other reviewers have mentioned with either of our purchases (2009 or 2012)."""
__label__pos	"""I can see how these bottles may be frustrating for some families, but the features some people dislike (dual nipple, collapsable outer nipple, etc) are the same features that have helped me maintain a breastfeeding relationship for over a year while working full time."""
__label__pos	"""I would and have purchased these bottles again."""
__label__neu	"""We bought this for about 70 bucks and got 4 sage lined wicker baskets to fit within it for organization."""
__label__pos	"""Great table, that does the trick."""
__label__pos	"""Fits almost everything we need for clothes, and we have a diaper depot hanging off the side to fit all the changing table items."""
__label__pos	""":)"""
__label__neu	"""i bought this for the 2nd child we're expecting and even though she's not here yet, we have her nursery set up."""
__label__pos	"""this is my four year old's favorite thing in the nursery."""
__label__pos	"""he loves to go in there, get it completely dark and turn it on just to look at the stars and moon projections."""
__label__pos	"""i'm going to order the turtle one for his room."""
__label__pos	"""We got the Healthy Care Booster Seat after both of my sisters-in-law told us how much they liked and used theirs."""
__label__pos	"""When my baby started eating solid foods (about 5 months ago) we got this, thinking it would tide us over until we chose a full-size high chair."""
__label__pos	"""We are still using it because it is so easy to use, easy to clean and we see no reason to buy another high chair that will just take up space."""
__label__pos	"""When we travel, we fold it up and bring it along."""
__label__pos	"""So convenient, so versatile and so cheap compared to a full-size high chair!"""
__label__neu	"""I bought this seat because my son wouldn't sit on the whole potty system we bought him."""
__label__neu	"""The seat was made entirely from hard plastic."""
__label__neu	"""He would cry, and wouldn't go to the potty."""
__label__neu	"""He is 22 months and just started potty training, but he didn't have any success with the hard plastic seat."""
__label__pos	"""But as soon as we started using the Soft Cars potty seat we had instant success."""
__label__pos	"""The seat is soft on little bottoms and the opening is great even for the smallest bottoms."""
__label__neu	"""My son is 32 1/2 inches tall and only weighs 23 pounds."""
__label__pos	"""Definately would recommend this seat for any other moms who are potty training their child."""
__label__pos	"""Best $12 I ever spent!"""
__label__neg	"""Do not buy this."""
__label__neg	"""We bought it, tried to use it, and threw it away."""
__label__neg	"""Avent Products contain BPA which is toxic for your baby."""
__label__neg	"""Dont poison your child with these toxins."""
__label__neg	"""Avent has to re-engineer their products."""
__label__neu	"""I bought this for my daughter who is very colicky and hates her car seat."""
__label__pos	"""I strap this onto the handle & she calms down immediately!"""
__label__pos	"""I love it!"""
__label__pos	"""We attach it to everything, the side of her basinett, her swing, wherever she goes."""
__label__pos	"""Its wonderful!"""
__label__pos	"""i purchased this exersaucer for my 4 month old daughter and she absolutely loves it!"""
__label__pos	"""It has different height adjustments which is a must since she is already 25 inches."""
__label__pos	"""She is very comfortable in this exersaucer."""
__label__pos	"""After doing extensive research I originally was going to buy a different model but I took my daughter to the store and she hated my 1st choice."""
__label__pos	"""This one she started playing with right away."""
__label__pos	"""It took me about 30 minutes to assemble the directions were easy to read and assembly wasn't hard at all."""
__label__pos	"""Money well spent!!!!!!"""
__label__pos	"""The bear works well, but I wish the sound would go for a longer period of time."""
__label__neg	"""It only plays for 5 minutes, which isn't enough to get my little one to sleep."""
__label__pos	"""I like the boppy."""
__label__pos	"""It's a great support pillow for my baby."""
__label__neg	"""It's not that great for nursing--the brest friend works better."""
__label__pos	"""But the boppy is nice for keeping the baby upright after feedings, and for tummy time too."""
__label__pos	"""I'm glad I got this pillow."""
__label__pos	"""We purchased this swing for our newborn son based on the fact that my wife uses one at the daycare she works at."""
__label__pos	"""Perhaps the biggest selling point for us was the fact that you have the option of using a plug-in adapter or batteries."""
__label__pos	"""Since just about every other item used for a baby takes batteries, it was nice to finally see a product with an A/C adapter."""
__label__pos	"""Other features that we like are the side-to-side or front-to-back swinging option, the wonderful mobile which features up-and-down movement, and the music/rainfall noises."""
__label__pos	"""All of these options work independently of one another, which makes this product even more appealing."""
__label__pos	"""We haven't had any problem with the swinging (or lack thereof) that others seem to be having."""
__label__neu	"""Sure, the swing doesn't move very fast, but I don't think my son is quite ready for roller coaster speeds just yet."""
__label__pos	"""My son seems very content while he naps in the swing as well."""
__label__pos	"""Overall, I think that this swing is an excellent purchase for anyone in the market for one."""
__label__pos	"""While it may not have the strongest motor, it has plenty of other options that make it a good buy."""
__label__pos	"""Highly recommended."""
__label__pos	"""I love this changing table."""
__label__pos	"""Its sturdy and has plenty of space to place items."""
__label__neu	"""I wouldn't put anything super heavy in the drawers, just regular baby things should be fine."""
__label__pos	"""I like that its easy to clean - changing pad and all which is very helpful when you have a baby boy."""
__label__pos	"""It looks beautiful with the rest of the baby furniture and was easy to put together."""
__label__pos	"""I absolutely love these cloth diapers."""
__label__pos	"""They are both my husbands and my favs."""
__label__pos	"""Easy to clean, easy to use, and come in some cute colors!"""
__label__pos	"""I bought a Siver Cross for long walks, etc. - I bought this Baby Trend and LOVE it for shopping, etc."""
__label__pos	"""A great stroller for the price - everyone should have one."""
__label__neu	"""Okay, I got this for newborn."""
__label__neu	"""It's CLEARLY stated it can NOT be used for sleeping, remember that."""
__label__neg	"""In fact, my baby distinctly disliked it."""
__label__neu	"""Now, if you have any good car-seats, etc."""
__label__pos	"""they come with quite good head-rests, etc."""
__label__neu	"""Thus, I really didn't have a need for this."""
__label__neg	"""Also, infants really don't ""travel"" much for this to be useful, as it's only supposed to be used in strollers, car-seats, bouncers, etc."""
__label__neu	"""This is CLEARLY stated in their product tag on the product."""
__label__neu	"""Now, as the child grows older and the need rises for these products, i.e. strollers, car-seats, etc., does this product is still needed?"""
__label__neg	"""NO!"""
__label__neu	"""Why?"""
__label__neu	"""As I see it, it's during the 1st."""
__label__neu	"""6 months, that there's an urgent need to have something in place, helping the child's head in developing to a correct shape."""
__label__neg	"""Thus: I am not sure of the product's usefulness."""
__label__pos	"""This set is wonderful."""
__label__pos	"""Lots of different colors and textures."""
__label__pos	"""A little of everything."""
__label__pos	"""Perfect for when baby starts to get tired of their hands and feet as toys!"""
__label__neu	"""I recently ordered this for our son."""
__label__pos	"""He loves it!"""
__label__pos	"""The second I gave it to him he started jabbering at it and trying to get the whole thing in his mouth."""
__label__pos	"""The crinkly wings make great noise and the colors are very vibrant."""
__label__pos	"""The reason I ordered this instead of another similar toy is because of the rings that hang from the bottom."""
__label__pos	"""At 3 months old his coordination is really starting to develop and it is easy for him to get and keep a hold of the rings."""
__label__pos	"""I would highly recommend this toy!"""
__label__neu	"""I received my Boppy as a gift."""
__label__neu	"""I don't breastfeed, so I really don't use it as much as other people probably do."""
__label__pos	"""It is nice to use to prop up my arm when bottle feeding."""
__label__pos	"""It is also nice to prop my daughter in."""
__label__neu	"""I could live without it though which is why I didn't give it 5 stars."""
__label__pos	"""This is the best car seat out there in my opinion."""
__label__pos	"""It is super easy to install with either latch or seatbelt."""
__label__pos	"""It is the easiest car seat I've installed."""
__label__pos	"""I like the side impact protection."""
__label__pos	"""I feel that my daughter is very safe in this seat."""
__label__neg	"""It is a bit tall, so if you are using it rear facing it does take up a lot of space."""
__label__pos	"""My daughter loves this car seat compared to a cheap seat that was our extra for the grandparents car until recently."""
__label__pos	"""This seat's seated shoulder height is higher than our cheap seat."""
__label__pos	"""That is why we had to replace the grandparents car seat."""
__label__pos	"""She is still in her Boulevard, but she is too tall for the cheap seat now."""
__label__pos	"""1st of all very portable, easy to use, and great low price."""
__label__pos	"""I currently expecting my 2nd child and was thinking of getting an electric pump, but after reading the reviews and the time it takes to express milk; I thought to myself why waste money if it's going to take the same amount of time."""
__label__neu	"""I was in the hosptital last year for a few days, in order to keep my milk supply, they gave me a Medela pump and let me used their (rental unit) Lactina."""
__label__pos	"""It works fine but cleaning the tubes and getting it set up is a hassle."""
__label__pos	"""I will consider renting it if I have low milk supply problem but I would not spend the money on the Medela pump."""
__label__pos	"""This product gets the job done."""
__label__pos	"""Does what it says."""
__label__pos	"""All you have to do is add water and pop it in the microwave for 2 mins."""
__label__neu	"""I wish it were a bit smaller, but I suppose its size accommodates large bottles."""
__label__pos	"""I put bottles, pacifiers, breast pump parts in it without a problem."""
__label__neu	"""I got this for my son when he was about 2 months old."""
__label__pos	"""Instantly he was entranced by the star's lights and music."""
__label__pos	"""Now, at 3.5 months, he loves hitting and grabbing the hanging toys."""
__label__pos	"""The really nice thing about it is that you can remove the star and attach it to the car seat or stroller for entertainment while out and about."""
__label__pos	"""It's been a great toy for him to play with independently."""
__label__pos	"""He can spend over 30 mins at a time playing by himself."""
__label__pos	"""The loops also let you change the toys frequently to prevent boredom."""
__label__pos	"""I would recommend this product to anyone having a baby."""
__label__pos	"""We've already gotten our money's worth out of it."""
__label__pos	"""The flip action is so easy to use that even your toddler (or your foot) can do it to make diapers and smell disapper."""
__label__pos	"""(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.)"""
__label__pos	"""And practically speaking, stratch another item off that long baby shopping list--with this you can forget the diaper pail refills and just use the good old kitchen garbage bags that are sitting under your sink."""
__label__pos	"""My daughter loves this mobile."""
__label__pos	"""She's still in the bassinet, but in the middle of the night or just when she's cranky, I can put her in the crib, turn on the mobile, and she stops crying."""
__label__pos	"""She is just so enticed by winnie the pooh and all the characters."""
__label__pos	"""She really enjoys herself!"""
__label__pos	"""Great product!"""
__label__pos	"""My daughter has used this for 3 months and loves it, very easy for her to hold."""
__label__pos	"""Cup has never leaked and is easy to clean."""
__label__pos	"""we have 3 of them and have tried other but these seem to be the best"""
__label__pos	"""The voice activated feature is great!!"""
__label__pos	"""And for what it offers, the price is very attractive."""
__label__pos	"""Four sounds, light, etc. - you will be glad you bought it."""
__label__pos	"""Our daughter can't sleep without it now :)"""
__label__pos	"""I ordered this for our 4 month old son and when it arrived I opened it up myself and didnt read the directions at first I got frustrated since I couldnt get it together then read them and voila it took me and a freind about 3 minutes to set it up!"""
__label__pos	"""Our son is past the stage where he will stay put in a floor bouncy chair so he loves the freedom of lying in this stretching out,and kicking."""
__label__pos	"""We loved it so much we ordered one for my mother in law so she can have in her house when he comes to visit."""
__label__pos	"""He also takes naps in it, we are hoping to travel with a smaller version of this pack and play soon..."""
__label__pos	"""will let you know how that works out."""
__label__neu	"""We have 2 toddlers and have bought many gates."""
__label__pos	"""This is by far the most attractive and easy to use gate of all that we bought."""
__label__pos	"""It is very slim so it is not very distracting and easy to use."""
__label__pos	"""This is our third one and I couldnt be happier."""
__label__pos	"""I was actually able to get them to work on stairs without adaptor plates but it takes some creativity."""
__label__pos	"""This is a perfect tub for any baby...."""
__label__pos	"""newborn and up."""
__label__neu	"""I have never used the hammock feature since the tub has a padded bottom."""
__label__pos	"""When our daughter was a newborn we placed her in and there she stayed, never slipping, while we washed her."""
__label__pos	"""She is now 7 months old and can sit up which makes bath time fun."""
__label__pos	"""The color changing plug has also been helpful."""
__label__neu	"""My girlfriend had her baby 11 days before me and she had purchased a different kind of tub."""
__label__pos	"""She then had to purchase another tub once her baby could sit up."""
__label__pos	"""I'd rather invest the extra money of a 2nd tub in my daughter's college fund."""
__label__neg	"""If I could give it 0 stars I would."""
__label__pos	"""I was really excited about getting this swing for my baby shower."""
__label__pos	"""My husband set it up and it was adorable."""
__label__neg	"""We put our son in it for all of 10 seconds, took him out, packed it back up and returned it."""
__label__neg	"""The speed of the swing is absurd."""
__label__neg	"""The lowest setting was almost catapulting my newborn out of it."""
__label__neg	"""I thought maybe the speeds were backward, so I put it on the last speed, and it was insanely fast."""
__label__neg	"""When we returned it, my husband told the cashier at babies r us that Six Flags should buy the rights to this swing, and that it tried to kill our son."""
__label__neg	"""He was a little dramatic, but this swing in my opinion is very dangerous and I wouldn't recommed it to anyone."""
__label__neg	"""If you do buy it, good luck and I hope you have better luck than we did."""
__label__pos	"""What more can you ask for?"""
__label__pos	"""This is one of those baby products!"""
__label__pos	"""It's VERY easy to use: so easy to use, you will learn to use it (believe me, this is important) &quot;in your sleep&quot;."""
__label__pos	"""It is inexpensive too: just shop around for other sterilizers and you will see this is the best one you can get for this price."""
__label__pos	"""Finally, and perhaps most important of all: this is an essential piece of baby gear."""
__label__pos	"""Sure, you can boil those bottles and those pacifiers, but let's face it: this is the 21st Century, and you might as well make use of your microwave."""
__label__pos	"""Excellent product."""
__label__pos	"""It makes nursing so much easier!!"""
__label__pos	"""I suggest bringing it to the hospital."""
__label__pos	"""I wish I had."""
__label__pos	"""I will for the next one."""
__label__pos	"""Helps keep mom comfy during long nursing sessions."""
__label__pos	"""Can also be used to help prop baby up when they begin to learn to sit or for them to lay in when they are little."""
__label__pos	"""Great gift idea."""
__label__pos	"""this is the best product."""
__label__pos	"""I bought it after redaing several reviews and am very happy that i got this tub for my little one."""
__label__pos	"""she loves it."""
__label__pos	"""I haven't used the straps for the teething toys yet, but the soft rail cover is perfect for my daughter."""
__label__pos	"""I would cringe when I would see her gnawing on the rail."""
__label__pos	"""This cover puts me at ease."""
__label__pos	"""It's easy to install, remove, and wash."""
__label__pos	"""Velcro lines the entire bottom of the cover."""
__label__neg	"""The only thing I would have changed is the length."""
__label__neg	"""Once installed, it's about two inches shorter than my daughter's crib rail."""
__label__neu	"""I used the Avent bottles for expressed breast milk; the #1 stage nipple took my daughter 45 minutes to finish and the #2 stage nipple took her only 15 minutes but she had horrible gas pains after the feeding."""
__label__pos	"""I read the reviews of these bottles and purchsed one to try it out and it worked like a charm."""
__label__pos	"""It took her only 15 minutes and no gas pains and very little spitting up!"""
__label__pos	"""I am selling all my avent bottles on ebay!"""
__label__pos	"""This teether is not only safe (free of chemicals, etc) but it serves the purpose better than any other teether out there!"""
__label__pos	"""It is easy to hold for baby, it is easy to reach any area of baby's gums (by teething on a leg for the back of the gums, an ear for the front of the gums, etc) and the material is on the softer side-unlike most teethers which seem to be too tough...."""
__label__pos	"""and the giraffe is cute for a boy or a girl!"""
__label__pos	"""we lost our first one at the zoo and just bought a second."""
__label__pos	"""our baby loves it so much, we gladly paid the $20 again to bring her much needed relief from teething pain."""
__label__pos	"""thank you so much vulli!"""
__label__pos	"""this will be a gift i give at all future baby showers."""
__label__neu	"""I purchased this for my 9 month old daughter who fights me every time I try to clip or file her nails."""
__label__pos	"""So I thought this will help."""
__label__neg	"""It turns out that it takes too long for his to file her nails down."""
__label__neg	"""(That's why I took off a star)."""
__label__neu	"""So I still clip them and then use this to make it smoother."""
__label__pos	"""I definitely like using this electric nail filer than a regular emery file from Babies R Us because I always file too much and end up messing up her nails."""
__label__pos	"""I can't seem to go wrong with this one."""
__label__pos	"""I'm sure this would have been an awesome nail filer if she was just an infant when her nails were still very soft and flexible."""
__label__pos	"""Too bad they didn't have this 9 months ago!"""
__label__pos	"""We didn't want more furniture if we could help it and this was a good compromise."""
__label__pos	"""This fits right on your chair, or you can use it on the floor."""
__label__pos	"""It has 3 positions, so it was easy to use when he was just starting solids."""
__label__pos	"""The tray is easy to put on and take off and the whole thing is easy to clean"""
__label__pos	"""These covers are fine."""
__label__pos	"""They are not soft like other covers but they do the job they are supposed to do and fit my tall sided changing pad, which I love."""
__label__pos	"""We love this gate, it is so easy to install."""
__label__neu	"""I just got rid of our superyard gate."""
__label__pos	"""That was not very good to use because you have to climb in and out of the gate."""
__label__pos	"""If you have an active child like mine, you will have to go in and out a lot."""
__label__pos	"""Several times i trip over it and it's not fun when you bang your legs into the gate."""
__label__pos	"""It is plastic but still it hurts!"""
__label__pos	"""Since we just change to this hands free gate, we are so relieved."""
__label__pos	"""It's worth every penny!"""
__label__pos	"""Avoid nipple confusion and use avent!"""
__label__pos	"""My 6 month old baby has been using this since he was only a few days old and there is no problem!"""
__label__pos	"""I breastfeed, but for the first 5 days when my milk hasn't come in, I used avent."""
__label__pos	"""My baby didn't have a problem switching from breast to bottle at all."""
__label__pos	"""Even today I give him juice using Avent and my son has no problem switching."""
__label__neu	"""But to backtrack to the birth of my son."""
__label__neu	"""The hospital bottle fed my son after taking him away from me because I had a c-section."""
__label__neu	"""The hospital used those Similac ready made formula that comes in their own bottle."""
__label__neu	"""Between that nipple and the Avent nipple my baby became nipple confused."""
__label__pos	"""It was a horrible experience getting him used to the Avent nipple, but once he did it was smooth sailing like I mentioned above."""
__label__neu	"""Learn from me!"""
__label__neu	"""If you plan on using Avent, bring some bottles with you to the hospital and instruct the nurses to check with you before bottle feeding your baby."""
__label__pos	"""Trasfer the formula to the Avent bottle and you'll avoid nipple confusion!"""
__label__pos	"""I have a Medela breast pump, and this feeding and storage set is so helpful and easy to use!"""
__label__neg	"""My baby is only 2 months old (weighs 14 pounds) and the infant insert is already so difficult to use."""
__label__neg	"""As a petite woman, it is difficult to lift the baby entirely over my head so that I can slide him inside the infant insert..."""
__label__neg	"""and when I do, the infant insert keeps folding up or his legs keep getting caught, which requires me to do it over."""
__label__neg	"""I had to do this so many times that my baby even threw up."""
__label__neg	"""It may be easy to put the infants in if they weigh less than 7 pounds because they are small but I had difficulty putting my baby in even when he was a newborn at 8 pounds."""
__label__neu	"""I had a fever in the hospital and they did not allow me to feed my baby until my fever broke."""
__label__neu	"""So as a result, they gave her a bottle in the nursery."""
__label__neu	"""Needless to say, weaning her to my breast was not easy and very, very frustrating."""
__label__neu	"""To further complicate matters, when my milk came in, I was so engorged that it was taking her twice the work to get anything."""
__label__pos	"""I was using a mini electric to relieve the engorgement which was not working well at all."""
__label__pos	"""I was fed up and I decided to pay the extra money to buy this pump because of all the great reviews."""
__label__pos	"""I am so happy I did because I was able to relieve the engorgement enough so that she was able to feed."""
__label__pos	"""I was able to wean her to the breast in less than a day after using the pump."""
__label__pos	"""And, when she is done with one breast and doesn't want the other, I am able to empty it in less than 10 minutes (sometimes even just 5 minutes!)."""
__label__pos	"""I highly recommend this pump because it saved my baby from being on formula."""
__label__pos	"""I used this throughout my pregnancy, and in those final days when you are so big and your belly is so heavy . . ."""
__label__neu	"""you can careless how big and this darn thing is!"""
__label__neg	"""My husband named it ""Leroy"" because it often was like having a 3rd person in the bed . . ."""
__label__pos	"""but it saved my back and hips."""
__label__pos	"""It was a wonderful present to receive in the beginning of my pregnancy and I recommend it to anyone who wants to congratulate a friend, daughter or sister, etc."""
__label__neg	"""The only thing I found which was untrue was using it to nurse after, it is way to long for that."""
__label__pos	"""I tried wrapping around me and then I was pushed forward and I was uncomfy, but the baby was fine ;-) I just passed it on to a non-preggo cousin that has back problems."""
__label__pos	"""I purchased this car seat for my daughter who just turned 1 & we are very satisfied."""
__label__pos	"""She loves her new big girl seat & my husband and I love how safe it is & the fact that it converts so she can use it until she's about 8 years old."""
__label__pos	"""The price was great, too & we've never had problems with any of our Graco products."""
__label__pos	"""It's a great seat- I highly recommend it!"""
__label__pos	"""this beats having to boil or nuke bottles to sterilize them hands down."""
__label__neu	"""pour in water, add rack of bottles, put on lid, press button."""
__label__pos	"""that simple."""
__label__pos	"""only thing i don't like is on the 24hr setting it beeps every 6hrs when it runs again."""
__label__pos	"""If you are really, really, REALLY hard pressed for space, then maybe this tub is for you..."""
__label__neg	"""except that you'll only use it for 3 months  because it is so small and then it will sit in storage wasting that valuable space."""
__label__neg	"""As with most tubs, this holds maybe a quart of water, which means, only babies bum is wet, how fun is that."""
__label__neg	"""And as soon as baby can sit, that is if she hasn't outgrown this small tub by then, she will not want to lay down at the angle this tub puts her at."""
__label__neg	"""Save space by getting a little bigger tub that will spend more time holding your splashing baby than sitting under your sink: I have the Newborn to Toddler Tub by The First Years--my baby is a year old and I still use it (she is petite, but I'm sure anyone can get at least 6-9 months out of it.)"""
__label__neu	"""I got this as a gift at my shower.."""
__label__pos	"""Itis beautiful, and if you have the money to spend, then go right ahead and get one."""
__label__neg	"""I personally would not have purchased it, because before my baby reached three months she had already outgrown it."""
__label__neu	"""Thank heavens she was starting to sleep in her room, else she would be in bed with us every night, which I am not too keen on."""
__label__neg	"""Yes, it is beautiful, but I guess I wouldn't pay so much for something which will be outgrown so fast."""
__label__pos	"""For my first baby I had the maya ring sling and I decided to try this one with my second child and boy am I glad I did!"""
__label__pos	"""This one is MUCH more comfortable than the ring sling."""
__label__pos	"""The ring sling digs into my neck whereas the sleepy wrap stays evenly on both shoulders."""
__label__pos	"""I have nursed my son while walking around a store and nobody new what I was doing."""
__label__pos	"""I don't think I'll be able to nurse him descretely for much longer as he grows but for a newborn its perfect."""
__label__neg	"""The baby can face in and out and only up front."""
__label__neg	"""The maya ring sling can be used all over: front, back, and side."""
__label__pos	"""But for the new baby stage I prefer the sleepy wrap and my son likes it too, he will sleep in it for a long time."""
__label__pos	"""I loved this!"""
__label__pos	"""I wasn't good about keeping it updated, but it's a great keepsake if you do."""
__label__pos	"""This is a great carrier!"""
__label__pos	"""It is half the price of the Baby Bjorn and it is so conveniant."""
__label__pos	"""I read a lot of the other reviews and read how other buyers complained about the straps but really, there aren't that many and it's super easy to adjust."""
__label__pos	"""The other great part is that it's a one size fits all so you and your partner can use it without having to buy two that are different sizes or worry that you bought the wrong size."""
__label__pos	"""My only complaint is that the front doesn't fold down."""
__label__neg	"""My little girl is 3 months and she is really curious and likes to face out but she can't because she's not tall enough."""
__label__neg	"""The front comes up to the middle of her face."""
__label__neu	"""She is little for her age."""
__label__neg	"""(She's only in the 15% for her height) but if it folded down like a lot of the others she would be able to."""
__label__pos	"""That's it though."""
__label__pos	"""Don't spend the extra money, buy this one and save."""
__label__pos	"""Don't be scared by other reviews saying it's complicated to use because it's not."""
__label__pos	"""We didn't even look at the directions and we figured it out!"""
__label__pos	"""We have these in our church nursery and they are really fun cars!"""
__label__pos	"""When I work in there I play with them with the little ones and we race them."""
__label__pos	"""They work great on the carpet there, although it is very thin and flat."""
__label__pos	"""I liked them so much that I bought some recently for my daughter (4) and son (11 months) and we do the same thing with them at home on the tile - race them."""
__label__pos	"""My son loves crawling after them and trying to get them to ""go"" on his own."""
__label__pos	"""He also loves banging them around and they've held up really good."""
__label__pos	"""They are soft rubber material so he can chew on them too."""
__label__pos	"""Fun, fun, fun!"""
__label__pos	"""These are absolutely necessary to get your co-sleeper to be level with the bed if you have a thick mattress (which most of them are these days)."""
__label__pos	"""I used every single one of them."""
__label__pos	"""They seem like they wouldn't be very sturdy/stable, but once the co-sleeper is strapped to the bed, it doesn't move at all."""
__label__pos	"""When our son decides he's hungry, he does not want to wait for the traditional method of placing the bottle in a bowl of warm water."""
__label__pos	"""This warmer is so fast!"""
__label__pos	"""It's ready in less than 4 minutes (we allow for it to cool a bit before taking it out)."""
__label__pos	"""Once you figure out how much water you need to fill for your type of bottle/milk, it works like a charm!"""
__label__pos	"""We use Dr. Brown's Wide Neck bottles and they fit just fine (as long as we remember to remove the straw first, otherwise the milk rised out)."""
__label__pos	"""This seat is so multi-functional."""
__label__pos	"""We use it instead of a high chair (we put the straps around a chair we have at home) and feed our daughter in it."""
__label__pos	"""When we first got it (~5mo), our daughter loved to sit and play in it."""
__label__pos	"""She loved to chew on the toys and toss around the cups!"""
__label__pos	"""Now that she's older (8 mo), we use it at feedings and to keep her occupied for a little bit when we are doing something around the house."""
__label__pos	"""The tray slides in and out easily to get the baby out."""
__label__neu	"""We were visiting friends who have a Bumbo..."""
__label__pos	"""it just looked uncomfortable (her thighs barely seemed to fit and she was just 6mo old!)"""
__label__pos	"""and it was MUCH harder to get her in and out of it and I HATED the plastic Bumbo tray that supposedly snapped in place..."""
__label__pos	"""it was so hard to use and caught her hands once, making her cry."""
__label__pos	"""\This seat is cheaper and more importantly, WAY more functional!"""
__label__pos	"""I love that it grows with my baby and plan to use it for a while..."""
__label__pos	"""This monitor is great."""
__label__pos	"""After reading reviews before registering when I was pregnant I crossed my fingers and registered for this monitor."""
__label__pos	"""We'll the research paid off, we've been using it for 8 months now and no problems what so ever."""
__label__neu	"""You get a little interferrence now and then but I'm sure thats normal."""
__label__pos	"""We couldn't be happier."""
__label__pos	"""My favorite feature is the ability to listen constantly to every little noise (best for when your a brand new paranoid mommy) or you can set it to mute out the background noise and only hear when the baby actually stirs in the night."""
__label__pos	"""Either way I recommend it."""
__label__neg	"""Would not stay on the table."""
__label__neg	"""The baby has no trouble peeling it off in the few places where it does stick, either."""
__label__neg	"""Besides, this ruins the table's finish."""
__label__neg	"""Overall, a waste."""
__label__pos	"""My husband and I love this baby carrier, but even more important- my 3 month old daughter enjoys it."""
__label__pos	"""We purchased it because we enjoy hiking & wanted to bring her along with us."""
__label__pos	"""The Synergy is great because its breathable so we can use it during the summer."""
__label__pos	"""Its really easy to adjust between users, I read that some people have trouble with that, but we haven't had any problems & we both use it regularly."""
__label__neg	"""We also purchased the bib which is a life saver because of all the drooling she does."""
__label__pos	"""I would definately recommend this carrier, it is expensive but for us its been a great investment."""
__label__neu	"""I am using this for the floor when my son lays down."""
__label__pos	"""It keeps him much cooler than laying on a blanket and adds a little bit of a cushion without being squishy."""
__label__pos	"""Very colorful and textured so my son likes playing on it."""
__label__neg	"""This product has no real educational value."""
__label__neg	"""The dye inside the foam does fade a bit when wiping it down with soap and water so I make sure it's absolutely dry from cleaning before I put my son on it."""
__label__pos	"""He can't really chew on it so I don't see it as an issue."""
__label__pos	"""We love these Avent bottles."""
__label__neu	"""Yes, you do have to ensure that the lids are ""primed"" (slightly wet the nipple, insert into cap, and pull up gently), and are on properly (tight but not too tight)."""
__label__pos	"""Of all the different bottles we tried, our son took to these the best."""
__label__pos	"""This one has the handle which makes it easier for real young ones to grip."""
__label__pos	"""Highly recommended!"""
__label__pos	"""these bowls are awesome."""
__label__pos	"""i love the 3 different sizes."""
__label__pos	"""i use the smallest one everyday to pack my daughter's snacks like diced fruit or veggies."""
__label__pos	"""i use the other two frequently when packing her food to go."""
__label__pos	"""i have no problems w/it suctioning to the table as long as i wet the bottom of the bowl."""
__label__neu	"""here is a tip when placing it: wet the bottom, place 1/2 of it on the table and push down firmly and then push the other 1/2 down onto the table."""
__label__neu	"""this will give it the strongest grip."""
__label__neu	"""to remove, just use the tip of your finger."""
__label__neu	"""of course if your toddler keeps yanking at it then it will come off."""
__label__pos	"""you have to have realistic expectations for this bowl."""
__label__pos	"""that probably means your child is done eating anyhow."""
__label__pos	"""we take one bowl to restaurants and it's perfect for serving whatever we are eating."""
__label__neu	"""the second she starts trying to pull it off, i remove it."""
__label__pos	"""yes, sometimes the lid is hard to snap but you just have to get the right angle."""
__label__pos	"""(btw, the disposable table toppers are also great for traveling.)"""
__label__pos	"""This is a great seat protector."""
__label__neu	"""Our son spilled a milk shake in the car and it dripped through the car seat onto the mat."""
__label__pos	"""The mat saved our upholstery and cleaned up with a damp rag!"""
__label__pos	"""Great!"""
__label__pos	"""It is very thick and sturdy, and the car seat does not slide when placed on it."""
__label__pos	"""It also keeps your vehicle seat from getting indentations from the car seat as well."""
__label__pos	"""It also covers the whole seat top to bottom."""
__label__pos	"""I accidentally bought a Kiddopotamus cover for our younger son thinking it was this one and it doesn't go all the way up the back of the seat to protect it from indentations from the car seat..."""
__label__pos	"""plus it's not as thick as this one."""
__label__pos	"""The fleece (polyester) that lines the inside comes off so easily."""
__label__pos	"""My little one had it all over her hands."""
__label__pos	"""I didn't want her to swallow it or inhale it so I sent it back."""
__label__pos	"""I use the Bundle Me Lite and that works great..."""
__label__pos	"""no fuzzies that come off."""
__label__pos	"""This placemat works very well; it catches most of the food that doesn't quite make it into our one-year-old little guy's mouth."""
__label__pos	"""Cleaning the floor isn't such a chore now."""
__label__pos	"""The suction cups work..."""
__label__neu	"""we have a farmhouse-style tile-top kitchen table..."""
__label__neu	"""just don't put the suction cups on the grout lines."""
__label__pos	"""No bad plastic smell."""
__label__pos	"""It rolls up easily and neatly for travel."""
__label__pos	"""Washes fine in the soapy sink with all of his other stuff..."""
__label__neg	"""one particularly messy incident with pasta and marinara sauce did stain it a bit, but this has faded now over several uses and washes."""
__label__pos	"""Highly recommended."""
__label__pos	"""Caveat: wait until your ready to serve to put it on the table..."""
__label__pos	"""if your little one is like ours, he/she will find it extremely amusing to pull up and roll the mat."""
__label__neu	"""We bought this for my son when he was about 2 months old."""
__label__pos	"""He would just lay in it and would be entertained for a long time, which bought me time to do housework around him, etc."""
__label__pos	"""You can take the hanging pieces down and hang up other objects so that there's always variety."""
__label__neu	"""I'd say he lost interest in it though at about 7 months when he learned to crawl."""
__label__pos	"""I bought mine used on ebay and it was worth the $35 I spent."""
__label__neu	"""I wouldn't spend much more than that."""
__label__neu	"""I bought this glider in the espresso/beige for my son's nursery."""
__label__pos	"""It is big, soft, cushiony, and looks nice."""
__label__pos	"""I like that with these colors I can use it in another room once we don't have a nursery anymore."""
__label__pos	"""Quality-wise, it is just about as good as my $600 custom made Dutalier glider that's in my daughter's nursery."""
__label__neu	"""Oh please!"""
__label__neg	"""Although Serta's Organic Contour Pad is free of phthalates and polyurethane foam, it IS treated with harmful flame retardant (see tag on back stating compliance with California law #133) and has a vinyl cover which contains PVC that can leach dangerous chemicals that at low levels to affect reproductive, endocrine and immune systems."""
__label__neg	"""How is this organic?"""
__label__neg	"""Try again Serta."""
__label__neu	"""My one year old loved to rip off his old bibs, plus they had some cloth in them so they took a while to dry, and they had those flip out pockets that sometimes flipped shut."""
__label__neu	"""We got sick of that, so decided to be a little more spendy and try these."""
__label__pos	"""THey are awesome!"""
__label__pos	"""No velcro, so the little guy can't rip it off (although sometimes that frustrates him too)."""
__label__pos	"""They are easy to rinse off and wipe dry, so they are ideal for restaurants."""
__label__pos	"""The pocket is big and molded, so it can't sort of glue itself shut when something wet comes along."""
__label__pos	"""We honestly should have bought these in the first place."""
__label__pos	"""Don't make the same mistake we did..."""
__label__pos	"""spend less, buy these now instead of the cheapo kind."""
__label__neu	"""My son first had this in the NICU when he moved out of his isolete and into a crib."""
__label__pos	"""He would stare at this rainforest and seemed really engaged so we bought one so he would have it at home too (my husband wanted him to have something familiar at home- so cute!)"""
__label__pos	"""Now he is a little over 6 months old (he was a preemie so he is almost 4 months adjusted) and he still loves it."""
__label__neu	"""I don't use it at night for him to fall asleep, in fact, I turn him the other way in his crib so he doesn't accidentally turn it on in the middle of the night."""
__label__pos	"""It works great if I need to put him in his crib to get something done for a few minutes and sometimes I use it during the day for naptime because it is already bright in the room."""
__label__pos	"""I have never changed the batteries but I use it one time a day at the most."""
__label__pos	"""It is really cute and my son is already figuring out how to turn it on for himself."""
__label__pos	"""As long as you don't plan on using it as your nighttime ""mobile"" then it is awesome!"""
__label__pos	"""(A side note- it doesn't attach to my crib because of the chunky rails around the top but my mom attached it to the bumper and it is very secure.)"""
__label__pos	"""You don't always want your kid gnawing on plastic and this is a good alternative."""
__label__pos	"""It is well made and colorful, and the different textures, sounds, colors, and movement really keep a baby entertained."""
__label__neu	"""The beads that form the rainbow portion of the ring are sort of strung on the ring instead of glued solid."""
__label__pos	"""Just one more element for entertainment."""
__label__pos	"""I am giving these as a gift along with the matching diapers - they look like really good covers."""
__label__pos	"""Very bright and colorful."""

__label__pos	"""He is actually enjoying bath time for the first time!!!"""
__label__pos	"""he is playing and kicking the water, which he has never done before.."""
__label__pos	"""he was always scared of the tub before..."""
__label__pos	"""I am so glad we got this!!!"""
__label__pos	"""I love it!!"""
__label__pos	"""And I feel safer using it than the old types of seats since this one attaches to the side instead of being in the tub where there is a risk of it tipping over."""
__label__pos	"""I picked this up at a local baby store for less than the price listed here today, but this is a good product that does the job of keeping up to three bottles' worth of formula separate."""
__label__pos	"""I'm pretty fond of all Avent products and this doesn't disappoint."""
__label__pos	"""When you pour one section of formula out into the bottle you sometimes get a tiny bit of powder from another compartment, but largely I have not had trouble."""
__label__pos	"""Now that our baby is a bit bigger it's also good as a snack carrier (Cheerios and the like) -- it's great to stretch out the usefulness of a baby product!"""
__label__neu	"""First, to all the parents who are sucking on the bottle to 'get it started' for your babies - STOP."""
__label__neu	"""LOL, all you have to do is squeeze the nipple once or twice, which pushes the air down and pulls the liquid up."""
__label__neu	"""If you read the insert that comes in the package, you would discover that for yourself."""
__label__pos	"""The Podee has been a lifesaver for us."""
__label__pos	"""It's great for traveling."""
__label__pos	"""We use it when our baby is in her car seat or stroller."""
__label__pos	"""It's great for late night feedings when you're drowsy and baby is hungry."""
__label__neu	"""How many times have we all nodded off a bit and dropped the bottle?"""
__label__neu	"""Too many times to count."""
__label__pos	"""Now, I can hold and rock my daughter comfortably while she eats without worrying about nodding off and upsetting the mood."""
__label__pos	"""Everytime I am out in public and my daughter is in her stroller happily sucking away on the Podee, people are amazed by this device, most have never seen it before, and everyone wants to know where to get it!"""
__label__neu	"""I have a 2.5 month old and 22 month old."""
__label__neu	"""I also run a Home Daycare."""
__label__neu	"""I have used the Original Diaper Genie and the Diaper Dekor."""
__label__neu	"""Both left a lot to be desired."""
__label__pos	"""But I love this product so far."""
__label__pos	"""There is no twisting."""
__label__pos	"""The refills are easy to put in and seem to last a while."""
__label__pos	"""Most of all: NO SMELL."""
__label__pos	"""I have been using it for several children of several ages, eating lots of different stuff: formula, baby food, table food."""
__label__pos	"""It works the best of anything I have used so far."""
__label__pos	"""These are some of the more expensive bottles on the market, but they are so worth it."""
__label__pos	"""My baby rarely even has to be burped after eating with these, and I love that there's never built up pressure in the bottle."""
__label__pos	"""The only thing I would change is the travel discs that are inserted so there's no leakage, either make the cap seal off the nipple, or put a little handle on the disc, they can get stuck up in the cap sometimes."""
__label__pos	"""This is just a minor inconvenience though, and doesn't take away from the awesomeness of the bottles."""
__label__neu	"""I got two of these from someone who's twin granddaughters never used them."""
__label__pos	"""I figured they were cute and she didn't want much for them."""
__label__pos	"""I'm really glad I got them."""
__label__pos	"""They are sturdy, my daughter has been using them to stand on for a while, long before she started potty training."""
__label__pos	"""About a week ago we actually started trying to potty train and these come in really handy."""
__label__pos	"""I have one in each bathroom and she can go use it, lift up the lid, take the ""cup"" and pour it in the potty and then return it to the chair."""
__label__pos	"""Its a simple design so its super easy to clean."""
__label__pos	"""She just used it as a seat on the big potty and it worked really well."""
__label__neu	"""It will take some practice for her to scoot all the way back on it."""
__label__neg	"""I think it could use something to make it slip a little less."""
__label__neg	"""It could be that mine is missing something though."""
__label__pos	"""Overall we both like this potty and would buy it again."""
__label__neg	"""I don't have this model, but the one with the blue bubble shower cap, and it doesn't seem to matter when reading the other reviews of this model because the mildew problem is still the same!"""
__label__neg	"""What were these manufacturers thinking?!"""
__label__neg	"""The design leaves MANY crevices where mold develops (under the flip top, the spout area, in and around the inside..)."""
__label__neg	"""I have to clean it out every week if that, and even then, some of the crevices are too small for even a toothbrush to reach, so now I will have to resort to soaking it in a diluted bleach solution."""
__label__neg	"""The only positive to say about this spout guard is that, yes, it does protect your child from bumping his head, but when they're toddlers, you will cringe to see them try to drink water out of the flip top and suck on it if there is MILDEW growing on the duck!"""
__label__neg	"""All in all, this is a horrible product!"""
__label__neu	"""We bought this last week for my 6 month old daughter."""
__label__pos	"""She LOVES it."""
__label__pos	"""Immediately she started bouncing away."""
__label__pos	"""She loves the toys on this too."""
__label__pos	"""We also have the Evenflo Exersaucer, and she didn't care as much for that one."""
__label__pos	"""It's supposed to bounce, but it is so hard for her to pounce in it since it's all plastic and you have to go in a downward motion to get it to bounce."""
__label__pos	"""The Jumperoo is suspended, so she is able to kick off with her legs and get it going."""
__label__pos	"""I highly recommend it!!"""
__label__neu	"""First, I have to say if you are considering getting a Keekaroo high chair, do it!"""
__label__neu	"""You will not be disappointed."""
__label__neu	"""I absolutely love this chair."""
__label__neu	"""It's sturdy and attractive and much less expensive than the trendy Tripp Trapp."""
__label__pos	"""That being said, get this cushion."""
__label__pos	"""It's a really nice addition to the chair."""
__label__pos	"""It's super easy to clean."""
__label__pos	"""Just wipe it down or for more deep cleaning, you can remove it and hand wash it in the sink."""
__label__pos	"""It looks super comfy for baby."""
__label__pos	"""Mine is always happy in her chair."""
__label__pos	"""Also the cushion looks very nice."""
__label__pos	"""As another reviewer pointed out, it doesn't look like cheap plastic."""
__label__pos	"""Highly recommended baby product!"""
__label__pos	"""this changing cover has worked well with our changing pad helded up in the wash from so many poopie diapers..."""
__label__pos	"""which is a nice pad along with our changing pad (which we whip clean before use  and after use.."""
__label__neu	"""over the pad its self (which sometimes my nephew sticks to without a oniez on!)"""
__label__pos	"""I bought this for my son because they have similar ones at his day care that he loves to play with."""
__label__pos	"""This one is even better though, because it also rattles!"""
__label__pos	"""It's so easy for him to hold and play with."""
__label__pos	"""A great toy!"""
__label__neu	"""I used this for a short time."""
__label__neg	"""It was more of a pain for us."""
__label__neg	"""I hated that you had to keep on top of it or you would never know how long it was in there."""
__label__neg	"""A timer would have been nice (and cheap enough to add)."""
__label__neg	"""I hated how I had to unplug it and plug it in every time I wanted to use it."""
__label__neu	"""Yes, it may be the best there is out there, but that doesn't mean too much."""
__label__neg	"""It still has many flaws."""
__label__neg	"""Now I love Avent items but this one they dropped the ball on."""
__label__neg	"""There is so much they could have done with this that they didn't."""
__label__neg	"""Oh well."""
__label__neu	"""My daughter is a month old and she has been sleeping on it since we got home from the hospital."""
__label__pos	"""I like it because she looks comfy on it and it keeps her on her side."""
__label__pos	"""She is starting to get a little long for it, but that's OK because she sleeps just fine."""
__label__pos	"""She hasn't had a problem sliding down at all and even though I'm a worried first time mom, I put her to sleep on it while she's in her bassinet."""
__label__neg	"""I only gave it 4 stars because it's looking kinda haggered."""
__label__neu	"""My wife picked up this little floating thermometer for our baby's bath."""
__label__neu	"""The attempt was to get and keep the temperature just right and to serve as a cutsie-poo toy that might interest the baby."""
__label__neu	"""So far, he's shown no interest in the toy aspect, but it has worked well with the temperature part."""
__label__neu	"""The colorful little floating turtle can be turned on or off and gives a digital temperature readout."""
__label__neu	"""In addition, it has three little colored lights, or actually, one light with three colors: Yellow is too cool, green is just right and red is too hot."""
__label__neu	"""We keep the water running throughout the bath and rely on the colored light scheme for temperature control."""
__label__pos	"""It has worked very well."""
__label__pos	"""We've only had the thermometer for a month and it has performed flawlessly."""
__label__pos	"""I'm surprised at the many negative reports."""
__label__pos	"""We've had no problems."""
__label__pos	"""I hope ours continues to perform well."""
__label__pos	"""I'd give it 4 stars from our experience."""
__label__neu	"""Gary Peterson"""
__label__neu	"""I have tried both, the Boppy pillow and My Brest Friend."""
__label__neg	"""For breast-feeding newborn babies I think that My Brest Friend is a lot more comfortable to wear."""
__label__neg	"""Also, it fits better around you when you seat in a glider or rocking chair."""
__label__pos	"""But the Boppy also gets the job done."""
__label__pos	"""The reason I think the Boppy is a must have is because you will be using it a lot when your baby starts tummy-time and it is also great for when they are almost sitting down by themselves."""
__label__pos	"""It provides the support they need, while allowing for some independence."""
__label__pos	"""I have two of them and find myself using them all the time."""
__label__pos	"""After much research I felt good about buying this mattress, even online and sight unseen."""
__label__neg	"""But after just one week of use it literally split at the seam."""
__label__neu	"""Here's what happened: My husband was flipping it over to determine which was the more firm side, when he noticed a long, loose thread."""
__label__neu	"""He went to cut it and it pulled in his hand, tearing the entire vinyl side apart on top and side so that the foam core was completely exposed."""
__label__neg	"""We have reached out to the vendor and our next step is to reach out to the manufacturer to try to refund our purchase -- not interested in a replacement! -- but it's completely not worth the big price tag for such poor quality in our opinion."""
__label__neg	"""UPDATE: Vendor was horrible about any kind of compensation, and I wrote up a report and submitted to Consumer Reports."""
__label__neu	"""I don't know that they did anything about it, but I felt better."""
__label__neg	"""Went out and bought a springs-based baby mattress from one of the big-name brands and we have been using relatively happily since."""
__label__pos	"""This product isn't that bad..."""
__label__neg	"""however it is not smell proof."""
__label__neg	"""I love the fact that it will take any type of trash bag, but if you do not empty the pail out daily the smell leaks out into your baby's room and it does not smell pleasant."""
__label__neu	"""I have a small baby that I bought the Kooshies for."""
__label__neu	"""He came home at just over 6 pounds and 20 inches long (long and lanky), so the newborn size still seemed a little bulky (although he did not seem to care)."""
__label__neu	"""I tried to use both preemie and newborn sized disposable for the short term and for visits and they both leaked so badly that I had to change his clothes almost every time!"""
__label__neu	"""This is with three different people putting them on."""
__label__pos	"""As a result I bring the Kooshies with me even on the go!"""
__label__pos	"""They are soft and absorbant and leak far less than the two disposables I tried."""
__label__pos	"""TRY KOOSHIES,  YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!!!"""
__label__neu	"""UPDATE:Now that my baby is a little bigger (around 9.5 pounds, 23 inches), I am still using the newborn size with a folded liner in front."""
__label__pos	"""This significantly reduces leakage of urine on the overnight."""
__label__pos	"""Although the disposables are working better than they did, the Kooshies still work just as good, if not better."""
__label__pos	"""I still love the Kooshies."""
__label__pos	"""We purchased it because it was well rated and we like it."""
__label__pos	"""Easy adjustable and have support for the baby head."""
__label__pos	"""The belts provide comfort for the back and shoulders,easy to carry the baby and do some things"""
__label__neu	"""I purchased sheets for the Graco Pack-N-Play as well as other custom size sheets several times in different colors and prints."""
__label__neu	"""Washed them many times."""
__label__pos	"""I never had sheets fit so well and wash so well."""
__label__pos	"""I've been giving them for gifts."""
__label__pos	"""I will definitely buy from this seller again.,  Excellent communication with seller, super timely delivery and most of all the prices are unbelievable."""
__label__pos	"""I have both the kick and play and this and I found this to be MUCH better."""
__label__neu	"""Here is why:"""
__label__pos	"""1. the fabric is SO much softer"""
__label__pos	"""2. the music is much more entertainig and not annoying."""
__label__pos	"""Also the music isnt so loud like the K n P"""
__label__pos	"""3. There is 3 vibration modes, unlike the 1 with the K n P."""
__label__pos	"""Also, the vibraion turns off after awhile as to not wear out the battery."""
__label__pos	"""Also, the vibration is MUCH quieter with this one."""
__label__pos	"""4.  The base seems much more sturdy."""
__label__pos	"""5.  The mirror is much larger and the lights are more entertaining."""
__label__pos	"""6.  There is many different modes for interaction, unlike the KnP which only has 2 options."""
__label__pos	"""As you can see I REALLY love this and so does my 1 month old daughter."""
__label__pos	"""You just cant go wrong with this purchase!"""
__label__pos	"""I save $10 and bought it at Target ($39.99)."""
__label__pos	"""Bought this based on other reviews and figured for the price of a coffee and cookie if this didn't work it wouldn't be so bad."""
__label__pos	"""They fit snug, so you have to use some force to pull them out."""
__label__pos	"""I was afraid a couple would fit loose, but all fit snug."""
__label__pos	"""They're clear so can't tell they're on."""
__label__pos	"""Love it."""
__label__pos	"""Recommend it."""
__label__neu	"""This swing has been used for all 3 of my little ones."""
__label__pos	"""The rocking motion, music, and sounds have all been a lifesaver when my arms were just too tired to hold baby."""
__label__neg	"""If I could wish for anything..."""
__label__neg	"""I would want this to have a timer so that it would turn off if I dozed off..."""
__label__neu	"""other than that..."""
__label__pos	"""this is definitely a MUST have item."""
__label__pos	"""I replaced the older version with this one because of the music and mobile."""
__label__pos	"""This one also seemed to be more robust than the early version that I had reviewed."""
__label__neu	"""Found this at a local store for half the price after buying online."""
__label__neg	"""I thought I had a large or standard tub spout/faucet, but this is too big for it."""
__label__neu	"""It seems like it may stay in place okay anyways though, but haven't used it yet."""
__label__neg	"""This seat is not designed to fit over the tracks of the door, therefore it becomes unstable."""
__label__neg	"""The seat does not swivel easily!"""
__label__neg	"""You really have to push & pull hard to get it to move at all."""
__label__neg	"""Also-I took mine back because my son kept getting his arm stuck between the seat and the arm that hooks over my tub!"""
__label__neg	"""No serious injuries to him, but he did get a bunch of scratches from the sharp seam on that arm."""
__label__neg	"""All in all-not a good design at all."""
__label__neg	"""I would say, buy anything else but this."""
__label__neg	"""This was not a very wise purchase on my part."""
__label__neg	"""I wish I'd done a little more research when looking for a bouncer (why this even comes up in a search for bouncers is beyond me..."""
__label__neg	"""it doesn't bounce!)."""
__label__neg	"""My son only used this a handful of times."""
__label__neg	"""The vibrating made him instantly upset, and while it's a nice feature that the music shuts off on it's own, there should be a setting to make it stay on for longer if you so choose."""
__label__neg	"""There was NO bouncing with this chair, so he just kind of sat there..."""
__label__neg	"""bored."""
__label__neg	"""I used it more as a place to set him while I did a quick chore or two around the house."""
__label__neg	"""In the end I think this chair is WAY overpriced for what it is..."""
__label__neg	"""basically a stationary seat with some very soft cushions and a little vibration and music."""
__label__neg	"""I say pass..."""
__label__neg	"""you can find better for cheaper."""
__label__pos	"""To be honest, we loved our infantino soft carrier."""
__label__pos	"""We used it regularly when our babies were newborns ..."""
__label__neg	"""but by the time my babies hit 12-13 lbs, this carrier became uncomfortable for me, pulling on my shoulders and causing me to arch my lower back - not good!"""
__label__neu	"""My husband still could use it till the babies hit about 15lbs, but this time around, we just went for the baby bjorn."""
__label__pos	"""So - if you are looking for something for the first 2-3 months, this is awsome - the baby is snuggled and cozy against mommy's (or daddy's) chest while leaving mommy's hands free - it is great for the transition for newborns."""
__label__pos	"""Again, we really liked it when our babies were small - if that's what you are looking for, this is the way to go..."""
__label__neg	"""if you want to continue using the carrier past 3 months, I would suggest looking at the more expensive Baby Bjorn for comfort..."""
__label__neg	"""This was the biggest disappointment."""
__label__pos	"""I used a friends electric pump (don't remember what brand it was) and a piece broke so I decided that buying a manual pump was fine since I only pumped to have some milk on hand for a babysitter if we went on a date or left the baby with his grandparents for any amount of time."""
__label__neu	"""Well."""
__label__neg	"""After about a month of rare use the star shaped piece that creates the vacuum started getting sucked down into the bottle."""
__label__neg	"""There was too much suction for it."""
__label__neg	"""It was so ridiculously frustrating to have to stop pumping all the time to unscrew the pump part off, fish in the milk for the piece, snap the top clip part off to reinsert it in place, fidget with the pump handle to get it back in place, pop the cap on, screw it back on, pump very carefully, and BAM- the piece is sucked back into the bottle; repeat."""
__label__neg	"""There is no way I could EVER recommend this product."""
__label__pos	"""This was a necessity (as much as I'd like to say otherwise) and I highly recommend it."""
__label__pos	"""I'm not a fan of fisher-price in general due to the fact that they are not the most conscientious company, but this swing is great!"""
__label__pos	"""The seat is comfortable and safe, the motor is strong and quiet, the mobile is a nice touch, and the seat cover is easy to clean."""
__label__pos	"""This swing soothes a baby's nerves when they are in their ""4th trimester."""""
__label__pos	"""My son napped in this swing regularly as a newborn and it did not hamper his ability to transition to the crib when the time came."""
__label__neu	"""Be very careful when taking the baby out of the swing when they are in the ""front to back"" swinging position as the baby can arch his back and cause a fall if you're not holding on to baby securely OR just leave the swing in ""side to side"" postion to be extra safe."""
__label__pos	"""We love this."""
__label__pos	"""I have pretty much stopped using my fancy mommy diaper bag and just use my husbands diaper dad backpack."""
__label__pos	"""It's so comfortable on your shoulders and fits a TON of stuff."""
__label__pos	"""We took it to Disney and put our food and camera and kid stuff in it."""
__label__pos	"""It's great in the rain and easy access to everything, including the wipes!"""
__label__pos	"""This potty rocks!"""
__label__pos	"""I was orignally ambivalent about the cartoon face but now I like it."""
__label__pos	"""The seat is removable and fits on an adult toilent for continuity in potty training."""
__label__pos	"""My son loves it."""
__label__pos	"""He wouldn't go near the old one with the big spash gaurd after he bumped up against it once."""
__label__pos	"""We got this one cuz the awful splash gaurd that is on most pottys is REMOVABLE!!"""
__label__pos	"""Yay!"""
__label__pos	"""Down with splash gaurds!"""
__label__neu	"""My son pees standing up like papa anyway."""
__label__neg	"""That is so funny that a previous reviewer called this the Pooperoo because my daughter poops almost everytime I put her in it!"""
__label__neg	"""And it really squishes up the back of her diaper because all her weight is pressing down right there - ew!"""
__label__pos	"""But anyway, this thing is AWESOME!"""
__label__pos	"""We bought it for my daughter right before she turned 4 months and, I swear, within a week of getting this for her my very ""colicky"" daughter was suddenly a happy baby."""
__label__pos	"""Before we had this, I was her Jumperoo - holding her for hours while bouncing on an exercise ball (not great on the back!)- and this seemed to solve all her problems!"""
__label__pos	"""She is now 11 months old and still goes in her Jumperoo about a half hour everyday to watch a Baby Signing Time DVD (and so I can take a shower!)."""
__label__pos	"""I'm surprised that even now that she is a skilled walker she still enjoys spending time in it."""
__label__neu	"""I'll be sad when she outgrows the weight limit!"""
__label__pos	"""This is great for babies learning to crawl and beyond."""
__label__pos	"""They can crawl and explore and have fun, and are completely safe."""
__label__pos	"""I put mine in my office and I can work but still be with my baby at the same time."""
__label__neu	"""If the sound is too loud, I have a suggestion - put some duct tape over the speaker (it's on the backside of the panel)."""
__label__neu	"""That will mute the sound by about 50%."""
__label__pos	"""It's lightweight, so if they hit their head toppling over, it doesn't hurt because it's hollow."""
__label__pos	"""And despite being so light, it's really sturdy."""
__label__neu	"""I suggest just buying 2 to put together, rather than buying extensions."""
__label__pos	"""You can bend it to fit any area."""
__label__pos	"""I just think this is an absolute must have for those with babies."""
__label__neg	"""My 11 month old can take these off with no problem."""
__label__neg	"""They're junk."""
__label__neg	"""Don't bother."""
__label__neg	"""Just use the old-fashioned, flat covers instead."""
__label__pos	"""Keeps my baby entertained."""
__label__pos	"""Lots to look at."""
__label__pos	"""It's her favorite car toy."""
__label__neg	"""I thought I would be receiving the iQ24, but I received a large size plastic container type thing that goes in the microwave."""
__label__neg	"""It is pretty much like a big tupperware container that you put bottles in and then put in the microwave to sterilize."""
__label__neu	"""The directions say to wash the bottles with soapy water before using this contraption..."""
__label__neg	"""so really I'm not sure why I'd need it."""
__label__neu	"""I don't have a dish washer so I guess it makes sure your bottles are sterlized properly, but if you use really hot water and give it a good wash then you wouldn't really need to go this extra step."""
__label__pos	"""But if you don't have the time or really need the bottles to be extra safe/clean, then I suppose giving them a quick wash and popping them in this container for the microwave could be helpful."""
__label__neu	"""I first got BabyBjorn when my son was just a month."""
__label__neg	"""But I returned it soon after I bought it."""
__label__neg	"""The baby was so soft and I had a hard time to put him into the BabyBjorn by myself."""
__label__neg	"""Plus, Houston is very hot, wearing BabyBjorn in the summer wasn't comfortable for me."""
__label__neu	"""When my son was 3 month old, his neck was a lot stronger."""
__label__neu	"""I wanted to try it, again."""
__label__pos	"""He really loved it."""
__label__pos	"""He enjoyed so much when I walked with him."""
__label__pos	"""He could look around and see the surroundings."""
__label__pos	"""I would say he liked this more than his stroller."""
__label__pos	"""Although this product does have good back support, at 6 month now, my son is more than 20 lb."""
__label__neg	"""My back cannot really support this weight for very long..."""
__label__pos	"""Very sturdy and safe gate."""
__label__pos	"""Pricey, but worth it for the security of not having your child falling down stairs."""
__label__neu	"""We've only used this tub a handful of times because our son is only 3 weeks old."""
__label__pos	"""I have not had any problems with the tub leaking."""
__label__neu	"""But like I said, we've only used it a handful of times."""
__label__neg	"""I definately don't think this tub is appropriate for small babies."""
__label__neg	"""The tub has absolutely no support for his head OR his body."""
__label__neg	"""It takes my husband AND I to bathe him b/c the tub offers no help."""
__label__neg	"""It would be just as easy to put him in our full size bath tub."""
__label__neg	"""I wouldn't recommend this tub for small babies."""
__label__pos	"""My son absolutely loves this swing."""
__label__pos	"""For my baby shower, I ended up registering for a much more expensive/over the top swing that my son ended up hating."""
__label__pos	"""They have this Fisher Price Papasan swing at the daycare he attends and the teachers kept telling me how much he loves it, so i bought one."""
__label__pos	"""I wish I had registered for this in the first place!"""
__label__pos	"""The rotating mobile is adorable and keeps him entertained whenever I turn it on."""
__label__pos	"""The seat is very cuddly and washing the cover is a breeze."""
__label__pos	"""I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!"""
__label__pos	"""These pads have come in very handy."""
__label__pos	"""I've used them as liners in baby's co-sleeper, placed them under baby's head while feeding, etc."""
__label__pos	"""Machine washable, and dry quickly when hung."""
__label__pos	"""Great essential product."""
__label__neu	"""My Mom bought this rocker to keep at her house for my baby."""
__label__pos	"""Since we live far away, she figured that she'd get more use out of this rocker than a traditional bouncer."""
__label__pos	"""My two month old daughter really likes it."""
__label__pos	"""She doesn't love her bouncer at home (we have the Ocean Wonders bouncer)."""
__label__pos	"""But she enjoys this one a lot more."""
__label__pos	"""She likes to look at the toys and she likes the rocking motion she makes when she kicks her legs and waves her arms in excitement."""
__label__pos	"""It looks very sturdy and will be ""her chair"" at Grandma's house for a while."""
__label__pos	"""We wish we purchased the rocker for her at home rather than the traditional bouncer."""
__label__neu	"""However, there are two reasons for the four stars:(1) The cow is facing the parents and not the baby."""
__label__neg	"""The baby cannot enjoy the adorable face."""
__label__neg	"""We tried to face it the other way, but when you pull the cord for music, it just pulls right off of the velcro strips you use to attach the hanging toys."""
__label__neg	"""(2) The music the cow plays is super annoying."""
__label__neg	"""The notes are really tinny and it repeats one note for a really long time."""
__label__neg	"""Sweeter music would be better."""
__label__neg	"""Also, the music doesn't last long enough and when your baby is too young to pull the cord herself, you constantly have to pull it for the baby."""
__label__neg	"""This is not as big as you think."""
__label__pos	"""Thank goodness they make this size!"""
__label__pos	"""I pump all of my daughter's milk now and this makes it easier!!"""
__label__pos	"""Less Pain"""
__label__neg	"""Save your money and go to a local Walmart and get the bottle warmer by Parents choice."""
__label__neu	"""It allows the bottle to be stored on low for 8 hours and actually will boil water if need be!"""
__label__neu	"""I bought this for my first son three years ago."""
__label__pos	"""He loved it and I'd have to restart it for him over and over (with or without the remote) because it captured his interest so well."""
__label__pos	"""The motor (the purple ball-shaped section) died within the first three months, but when I called Tiny Love, the company that makes this, they sent a new one completely free of charge, and it continued to work well."""
__label__pos	"""The music is lovely and you can set it to just one tune or to cycle between the three different songs."""
__label__pos	"""The animals are fabulous to look at - black and white plus bold colors, with buggy eyes to boot."""
__label__pos	"""Now, my second son is enjoying it."""
__label__pos	"""As a matter of fact, now that it's up again, my three-year-old likes to turn it on to watch and listen too."""
__label__pos	"""I'd have given it less stars for breaking down, but getting free replacement parts and great customer service won back all the stars!"""
__label__pos	"""At first I thought I was being a tad frivolous by registering for this, but I'm so glad I did!"""
__label__neu	"""We have hard wood floors."""
__label__pos	"""We use this on top of our daughters play mat so that she can lie on something padded while she bats at the hanging toys on her gym."""
__label__pos	"""She loves lying in it and looking around the room, and it slightly elevates her head so she's not flat on her back."""
__label__pos	"""Not a must-have, but it's certainly a nice to have!"""
__label__pos	"""The pump, while a bit nerve-wracking to first aseemble all the pieces, hoses and containers, was very easy to use."""
__label__pos	"""I was amazed at how much milk I got at the first sitting!"""
__label__pos	"""This is an investment, but well worth it."""
__label__pos	"""When I was purchasing it, a woman at the store said she had bought the newer 'delux' model that Madela just came out with, and it made her nipples bleed."""
__label__neu	"""Ack."""
__label__pos	"""She ended up with this one, too, and highly reco'd it."""
__label__pos	"""This is a must-have for working mothers."""
__label__pos	"""I only work part-time, but this is a lifesaver for having enough milk to work, go out, or even milk with cereal."""
__label__pos	"""Well I actually read from the site that the Diaper Genie was good and bought it."""
__label__neu	"""Well.."""
__label__neg	"""nope."""
__label__neg	"""Here are the things that stink (no pun intended) about it.."""
__label__neg	"""1.  You are supposed to be able to twist the dial at the top to seal the diaper up."""
__label__neg	"""At almost every playgroup I go to (and my diaper Genie as well) the top has not sealed the last diaper so when you go to put your new diaper in, you get the wonderful aroma of aged poop."""
__label__neg	"""Lovely!"""
__label__neg	"""2.  The blade that is supposed to cut the bag so that you can empty the contents has never worked the first time."""
__label__neg	"""You have to sit there and push the button over and over again."""
__label__neg	"""It is pretty silly."""
__label__neg	"""3.  The replacement bags are expensive and they have different types for different ages in order to be more complicated."""
__label__neg	"""I guess one has to be picky when it comes to diaper trash bags!"""
__label__neg	"""4.  All diaper trashcans are going to smell."""
__label__neg	"""Both Diaper Champ and Genie cut down on the smell but you are asking for a miracle if you think you are never going to smell poop in your baby's room."""
__label__neg	"""Anyways, after buying the Genie, I bought the champ and I am perfectly happy with it."""
__label__neg	"""Plus it is kind of fun flipping the top to get the diaper in."""
__label__neg	"""(simple pleasures!)"""
__label__pos	"""I just got these in the mail today and I am so excited to try it."""
__label__pos	"""I was worried I thought that it would be small, but it is actually pretty big."""
__label__pos	"""Looks like it will work really well for catching the milk."""
__label__neu	"""I will update when I get to use it."""
__label__pos	"""These are great toys to entertain your new baby."""
__label__pos	"""Just hang them from the bar on their infant car seat and they will be entertained while you do small errands around the house or at the market."""
__label__pos	"""My kids loved to bat at these bugs and each bug makes a different noise too!"""
__label__pos	"""I LOVE this product."""
__label__pos	"""My sister (mother of 2) recommended this to me and I am so grateful."""
__label__pos	"""It is not anymore difficult than emptying my kitchen trashcan and it smells a lot better!"""
__label__pos	"""This is a must have for any new parent!"""
__label__pos	"""I feel this is one of those special things - most people haven't found yet, or don't know about."""
__label__pos	"""We used this lounger sooo much with our son."""
__label__pos	"""It helped keep him propped up, so that he wasn't lying down flat."""
__label__pos	"""It was so cozy for him."""
__label__neu	"""We placed it inside our co-sleeper, initially, and later took it with us when visiting Grandma."""
__label__pos	"""You can set it on the bed or sofa and it creates an instant bed for any newborn."""
__label__neu	"""Of course, we always kept an eye on our son, too."""
__label__neu	"""He wasn't left on the sofa."""
__label__neu	"""One of us would be sitting next to him."""
__label__pos	"""But, it was an alternative and it also kept him from lying down flat."""
__label__pos	"""We then had our lap free for a moment to read or relax."""
__label__pos	"""We consider it a ""must-have."""""
__label__neu	"""bought this for our 2 year old as he has been sleeping in a sleepsack since he was a teeny little guy."""
__label__pos	"""he is tall for his age & will be able to wear this for a LONG time, it is big & roomy."""
__label__pos	"""we love all the sleepsack products & I was happy to find one in this size!"""
__label__pos	"""I have yet to use this bag, but I think it's a marvellous design and will attach it soon to my stroller, once the weather warms up."""
__label__neu	"""These locks took some time to install, however when you follow the instructions it goes very smoothly."""
__label__pos	"""The time now was well worth the ease in the future."""
__label__pos	"""Plus, after my daughter has outgrown the need for cabinet locks I can put them in their inactive mode."""
__label__pos	"""This is great because when we have future company we can reactivate them and the home is childproof again."""
__label__neg	"""Just be careful on cheap cabinets because you can drill through the entire door!"""
__label__pos	"""Definitely a wonderful investment."""
__label__pos	"""Easy to slide baby in & out of the carrier."""
__label__pos	"""Comfortable for mom & baby."""
__label__pos	"""My baby usually falls asleep while I carry her around in this when in the stores."""
__label__neu	"""I recommend practicing putting baby in & taking her out before actually going out with it for the first time."""
__label__pos	"""Also nice that instructions are printed on inside of carrier."""
__label__neu	"""I nursed our son for about 7 weeks without this, like many mothers, slouching and what not was killing my already injured back, a friend of mine had one and i tried it..."""
__label__pos	"""loved it!"""
__label__pos	"""Ordered one for myself and cant do without."""
__label__pos	"""Even ordered an addiotional one for my grandparents house that we are going to in the next week in another state!"""
__label__pos	"""Highly recommend and I will definantly be using this for our other babies to come!"""
__label__pos	"""Thanks Medela for once again, making an outstanding product..."""
__label__neu	"""also..."""
__label__neu	"""If anyone is having problems with there child- reguardless of age-- lactching on or nipple soreness or whatever......"""
__label__pos	"""I recommend the medela nipple shield, I used it for latch on problems and immediately my son nurses just fine, its for temporary use but I have been using it non stop sense my son was born.."""
__label__pos	"""keeps me from being sore!"""
__label__pos	"""You can buy it at Target or anywhere Medela products are sold."""
__label__pos	"""I own the pump in style advanced..."""
__label__pos	"""get this one, its worth every penny!"""
__label__pos	"""Fits very snug on my table and nicely padded."""
__label__pos	"""My daughter doesn't hurt herself on the coffee table now"""
__label__pos	"""i got this product so i don't have to fill in the whole bath tub for my baby son, as well as it seems like a good transition from the infant tub to the bath tub."""
__label__neg	"""However, the fact that the cap won't close anymore, totally defeates my whole environmentally conscious purpose!"""
__label__neg	"""so, I do not recommend it..."""
__label__neg	"""sorry, but it's low quality"""
__label__pos	"""My baby always smiles and laughs when she looks at this mobile."""
__label__pos	"""Even though I don't think it's particularly cool-looking, she does, and that counts!"""
__label__pos	"""I love how this has music and a spinning action above her."""
__label__neg	"""The ony thing I changed was instead of the brightly colored plastic thing that spins going face up, I put it so it faces where she can see it."""
__label__neg	"""That makes more sense to me."""
__label__pos	"""You can see in the pic what I mean, other than that it is great."""
__label__pos	"""This was one of the best purchases we've made!"""
__label__pos	"""Our 9 week old loves baths in this tub."""
__label__pos	"""He's very comfortable in it since it cradles him & I love the idea that it can be used for so long."""
__label__neg	"""We purchased it directly at the store which I see was wise since shipping can be so expensive."""
__label__neg	"""It is very big compared to the other tubs out there, but we just store it in our bathtub when it's not in use."""
__label__neu	"""We had been letting my son fall asleep with us in a family bed, but after a year of this..."""
__label__neu	"""my husband and I decided it was time to at least let him go to bed earlier than we did so that we could have some alone time."""
__label__neu	"""Putting him down in his crib (in our room) didn't work..."""
__label__neu	"""he'd cry and cry."""
__label__pos	"""Enter the Leap Frog Dreamscapes Soother."""
__label__pos	"""After about two nights, he stopped crying when being put in his crib..."""
__label__pos	"""because he was looking forward to the ""Goodnight Toes"" story."""
__label__pos	"""I only wish we had bought this sooner."""
__label__pos	"""Thanks Leap Frog!"""
__label__neg	"""We have this blanket in 3 of the different fabric choices, and this one in particular shrunk the most in the wash (the fleece is much better, but too warm for Arizona...)."""
__label__neg	"""It is definitely hard to get the velcro fastened around our tiny 2 month old."""
__label__neg	"""We also have the cotton jersey ones, but this only comes in large, which is HUGE!"""
__label__neg	"""I wish there was a size medium, which would be perfect."""
__label__pos	"""I do love the price and the fact that you can fasten it into a carseat."""
__label__neg	"""It has definitely helped calm our newborn on car rides, but unfortunately won't fit her too much longer..."""
__label__pos	"""Love this sterilizer."""
__label__neu	"""I had been using the reusable steam sterilizer bags...."""
__label__pos	"""what a waste of space!"""
__label__pos	"""This thing holds so much more than the little bags and sterilizes in the same amount of time!"""
__label__pos	"""I give it 4 stars out of 5 only because it is hard to fit breast pump shields/pieces and bottles and nipples in the same sterilizing ""batch"" but otherwise I love this thing."""
__label__pos	"""The little latches on the sides never come undone unless I open them."""
__label__pos	"""Easy to use, simply add 7 oz of water in the tray, close it up and microwave for 2 minutes."""
__label__pos	"""Then open with the steam side away from you and hang your things up to dry."""
__label__neu	"""I use the Munchkin fold up drying rack too."""
__label__pos	"""This sterilizer holds Avent bottles (even the 9oz) perfectly!"""
__label__pos	"""The manual suggests an arrangement that will hold 4 bottles, 4 nipples, 4 screw on collars, and 4 lids, and that works out well, even with Avent."""
__label__pos	"""got this for son when he does his art classes it is great planning on getting another for home"""
__label__pos	"""My daughter just love it."""
__label__pos	"""She can sleep in too!!!"""
__label__pos	"""OH..."""
__label__pos	"""Great Price too!!!"""
__label__pos	"""Absolutely recommend it."""
__label__pos	"""I've tried the washable breastpads and they're no good!"""
__label__pos	"""You soak right through them."""
__label__pos	"""The Avent pads were relatively inexpensive and work wonderfully!"""
__label__neu	"""I buy the 100ct two boxes at a time."""
__label__neu	"""You can ask my husband - I've purchased at LEAST 5 potty seats since getting our son to use the potty."""
__label__neu	"""I've returned 4 of them immediately after seeing how the design of the seat would not work for our son (I would have a little Bellagio Fountain spraying on my floor instead of the toilet)."""
__label__neu	"""The one seat that did end up staying in our house seemed great at first, but I later discovered that there were gaps on the bottle of the seat that captured urine and required constant cleaning."""
__label__neu	"""So I sucked it up and threw down the money for the more expensive Baby Bjorn."""
__label__pos	"""WHY didn't I buy this sooner!?!?"""
__label__pos	"""This is the best potty seat I purchased."""
__label__pos	"""There are absolutely no hidden gaps or fabrics that can soak up or trap urine."""
__label__pos	"""It is adjustable to fit into any type of toilet seat."""
__label__pos	"""There is a small splash guard (more like a ridge) in the seat so no ""fountaining"" can occur."""
__label__pos	"""Everything that I've complained about in the previous potty seats is addressed with the Baby Bjorn - it works fantastically!"""
__label__pos	"""Highly HIGHLY recommended."""
__label__pos	"""this product saved us a lot of grief."""
__label__pos	"""baby would not nap without it for the first couple months."""
__label__neu	"""Battery life is decent, but wish they had a AC plug in model."""
__label__neg	"""also the music shut off every 7 minutes, should play for longer."""
__label__pos	"""The legs started bending a little too, towards the end, but over very happy we got it."""
__label__pos	"""you won't regret it either if you baby has some trouble sleeping."""
__label__pos	"""Do yourself a favor and get these Playtex bottles to begin with."""
__label__neu	"""I started with Avent bottles (because Avent also offers sterilizers, bottle warmers, etc....)"""
__label__pos	"""But Avent bottles were AWFUL."""
__label__pos	"""They leaked and it was impossible to screw the lids on correctly."""
__label__neu	"""So I got Dr. Brown bottles."""
__label__neg	"""They were pretty good and they didn't leak..."""
__label__neu	"""but it was a big hassle to wash (it takes forever to wash so many little parts with the tiny brush they give you)."""
__label__pos	"""So I switched to Playtex after finding out that it offered BPA-free disposable liners."""
__label__pos	"""I am so happy I switched."""
__label__pos	"""It doesn't leak!"""
__label__pos	"""And my life is so much easier since all I have to do is wash the nipples...."""
__label__pos	"""and the baby likes it."""
__label__neu	"""I bought this when my daughter was a couple weeks old."""
__label__pos	"""I had a hard time getting her to nap/sleep anywhere except my arms, but she did nap many times in this adorable basket."""
__label__neg	"""The only con I would say is that the handles are pointless, and I never used the hood."""
__label__pos	"""Now at 4 months old she's probably too big for it but we've been using it as a one-stop place for toys, diapers, ointments, burp cloths, etc."""
__label__neu	"""etc."""
__label__pos	"""It is VERY cute no matter how you use it!"""
__label__neu	"""My daughter started using this gym when she was just over 2 months old."""
__label__neu	"""She would only play for about 5-10 minutes at a time she would mostly look at everything and hit things by accident."""
__label__neu	"""I always placed her feet on the crackly leaf."""
__label__neu	"""I added a few different toys like jacques the peacock and celest - sun/moon toy with a teething star that hung almost to the bottom, and her zebra."""
__label__pos	"""At 3 months she got a lot more use out of it like 20 minutes or more a day she could grab onto the teething star and the zebra and spin the parrot."""
__label__neu	"""she started shifting herself around to get to different toys."""
__label__pos	"""By 4 months she was would stay and play for an hour or more..."""
__label__pos	"""and she started rolling over - i think it had to do with all the kicking and arm swinging from playing in the gym it just really helped develop her muscles."""
__label__neu	"""She is now 7 months old and does not play in it so much (I keep it set up in the living room so she can crawl to it and play  when she wants) just yesterday I found her sitting up in there now playing with the butterflies!"""
__label__neu	"""This is the second swaddling blanket I have bought."""
__label__pos	"""Both helped my baby sleep better and longer."""
__label__neu	"""The first one was a different brand and used Velcro to keep it swaddled."""
__label__neu	"""The Velcro didn't stick well for long."""
__label__neu	"""It only somewhat keep my baby swaddled."""
__label__pos	"""This one does not use Velcro and stays swaddled all night."""
__label__pos	"""It signals my baby that its bedtime and keeps that jerk reflex from waking him up."""
__label__pos	"""We get much longer periods of sleep as a result."""
__label__neu	"""I have been using the Genie for the first four months of my daughter's life."""
__label__pos	"""It is great to have in the early days when you are dead tired and changing a poopy diaper every hour."""
__label__pos	"""I don't empty mine until it is full and have never had a stinky house(I am a clean freak)."""
__label__neg	"""That being said, I am now selling mine b/c I don't want to buy the expensive refills anymore."""
__label__neu	"""She only poops once a day or so-I just put it in a plastic bag and straight into the outside can."""
__label__neu	"""The pee pee diapers go into the regular trash b/c that goes out every other day anyway."""
__label__neu	"""Every dollar counts when you are a SAHM!"""
__label__neu	"""I had trouble with my first monitor which was the Summer Video Monitor."""
__label__neu	"""The picture quality was poor and it was always staticy."""
__label__pos	"""I didn't want to blow off another $100 bucks on monitor so I tried this one for $29.99."""
__label__pos	"""So far I haven't had any problems with it."""
__label__pos	"""The sound quality is excellent."""
__label__pos	"""There's no static at all and it's so clear I could hear the clock in my babies room."""
__label__pos	"""We're so use to hearing that static noise that my husband and I keep testing it to make sure it's working since it's so quiet and static free."""
__label__pos	"""I also love the fact that it works on batteries so I can roam around the house with it clipped to my belt or I can plug them in to save the batteries."""
__label__pos	"""Overall, this is a great monitor and a very great price."""
__label__pos	"""Remember, price doesn't always equal quality..."""
__label__neu	"""I learned the hard way."""
__label__neg	"""I returned the headrest that I received at my baby shower."""
__label__neu	"""I found that the items I needed to use it with (the carseat, the stroller, the swing, etc.), came with their own headrest."""
__label__neg	"""Also, parents should know, that when I had my carseat checked by the sheriff department's trained carseat safety deputy, I was told NOT to use one of these in a carseat UNLESS the seat comes with one that is made to specially fit that seat."""
__label__neg	"""Using one in a seat that it wasn't made for can cause your child to fit improperly in the seat, putting them at greater risk for injury."""
__label__neg	"""The product may be a fine one, but I found an &quot;extra&quot; one to be unnecessary."""
__label__pos	"""This warmer is small enough to go back and forth with my daughter to her sitter's every day in her diaper bag."""
__label__pos	"""I would leave it there, but my husband uses it if she gets hungry and Im not home from work yet."""
__label__neu	"""I get a brown residue on the bottom, but I attribute that to the water quality, because I get it on my steam sterlizer, which is a different brand."""
__label__pos	"""This is a very nice product."""
__label__neu	"""You're not supposed to keep your baby in a snowsuit while it's in a car seat because it interferes with the tightening of the harness straps."""
__label__pos	"""This solved all my problems."""
__label__pos	"""With my first daughter I was constantly having to take her out of her snow suit and then put it back on her when we got to where ever we were going."""
__label__pos	"""It was a pain in the butt."""
__label__pos	"""I got smart with my second daughter and bought this."""
__label__pos	"""I will be using this again when my third daughter comes in a few months."""
__label__pos	"""I love this caddy."""
__label__pos	"""It saved me alot of space."""
__label__neg	"""The only thing that I was disappointed about is that the changing pad has a stain on it (it's underneath the plastic)."""
__label__neu	"""I received the GRACO dual receivers as a baby shower gift."""
__label__neg	"""This monitor was not very good."""
__label__neg	"""It had so much static."""
__label__pos	"""It did its job, so I kept it."""
__label__neg	"""However, I refused to take it with me traveling."""
__label__neu	"""I travel to Indiana because my younger sister lives there."""
__label__neg	"""She has a two story house and when I would put the baby down I couldn't hear her cry from downstairs."""
__label__neu	"""I went to the store and found this monitor."""
__label__pos	"""It was only $20 so I figured if it worked even half as well as the GRACO it would be okay."""
__label__pos	"""Let me tell you, it is great."""
__label__pos	"""I could hear the TV in the next room."""
__label__pos	"""I could hear the fan rotating."""
__label__pos	"""I could even hear her roll over."""
__label__pos	"""On top of that, I could see her larger movements with the lights."""
__label__pos	"""When she cried all the lights glowed."""
__label__pos	"""I was tempted to take this monitor back home with me and bring the one I have in my house to Indiana my next visit."""
__label__pos	"""This is a great monitor, don't be fooled because it is cheap that it isn't good."""
__label__pos	"""It is great."""
__label__neg	"""When I was pregnant with my daughter, everyone told me how horrible the Baby Bjorn was for the baby and on your back."""
__label__neu	"""So I looked into other carriers and the one that recieved 5+ star reviews (and was about $150) was the Ergo Baby Carrier; my sister had had one when my two nephews were little and it was great!"""
__label__pos	"""She ordered me one as a gift and I HATED IT!!!!"""
__label__neu	"""It was so big and bulky that I only used it once and it was trying it on!"""
__label__neu	"""I then went without a carrier, but my daughter had bad gas when she was younger so we would get tired of holding her."""
__label__pos	"""My husband brought home one of these Baby Bjorn Carriers and it saved our lives!"""
__label__pos	"""She loved to be in it and it was not painful on our backs at all!"""
__label__pos	"""Our daughter is now 11 months and we still use it, she is only like 16 lbs, and she still loves it!"""
__label__pos	"""Her face lights up when she sees it because she knows she is headed out on the town!"""
__label__pos	"""Thanks Baby Bjorn for making this great product!"""
__label__pos	"""Okay, so this was delivered quickly, and it took me less than 10 minutes to set up."""
__label__pos	"""At first I overtightened it, and it wouldn't shut, so I loosened it and everything was fine."""
__label__pos	"""I decided to forgo the padded discs that you can screw into the wall to keep the gate in place, because I thought my daughter wouldn't be strong enough to dislodge it."""
__label__neg	"""WRONG."""
__label__neu	"""After about two weeks of pretty much leaving it alone, she decided she wanted to come into the kitchen, and she wanted to do it NOW."""
__label__neg	"""So she gave the gate two or three really good yanks, and the bottom came loose, followed by the top, and the whole thing needed to be put back up."""
__label__neu	"""So this time I marked where I wanted to screw in the padded discs, because not having a gate at all is NOT an option (we occasionally need to put down mousetraps, and don't want her to get to them and hurt herself)."""
__label__pos	"""Marking and installing the discs took less than five minutes, and this time around, installation was a snap."""
__label__pos	"""The gate has stayed in place for about two months now."""
__label__pos	"""She can yank on it all she wants, it isn't going anywhere."""
__label__pos	"""I'm much more impressed with this gate than I was with the Summer Infant play yard."""
__label__pos	"""I would recommend this to other parents."""
__label__neg	"""This diaper stacker is a joke."""
__label__neg	"""The diapers come out 3 at a time, the shelf for the wipes container will buckle if you have a full container, and the plastic is very flimsy."""
__label__neu	"""I brought this because of the great reviews this product got."""
__label__neg	"""After just one day of using this I decided to pack it up and return it."""
__label__neg	"""I don't believe this product is ment to withstand the test of time."""
__label__pos	"""My baby loved this when she first sat in it."""
__label__pos	"""She sat for almost an hour in awe."""
__label__neg	"""As time passed she was not entertained for long."""
__label__pos	"""It is very calming and now I use it for when she is sleepy."""
__label__neu	"""I bought this changing table with the matching Delta Jenny Lind crib from another store (shop around for the best price)."""
__label__neu	"""When they arrived, my husband and I set up the changing table first."""
__label__pos	"""It was very easy for us to set up (although I think it would be quite difficult for just one person to do)."""
__label__pos	"""I did feel like the wood was going to crack at times, as in some places it must be strained to fit together while you tighten the screws, but it held up in the end, and is actually much sturdier than it looks like it is going to be when you take it out of the box."""
__label__neu	"""Are there nicer, sturdier products out there?"""
__label__neu	"""Absolutely, but you're going to pay for the difference."""
__label__pos	"""Overall, we are very pleased with the value of the product for the price."""
__label__neg	"""However, as a side note, the oak crib did not match its ""matching"" changing table."""
__label__neu	"""The changing table is a nice reddish oak, while the crib was very blonde."""
__label__neg	"""We took the items back to exchange for a matching set, only to receive another unmatched set."""
__label__neg	"""Please be aware of the color differences if you are considering purchasing the set."""
__label__pos	"""I went on reviews when I bought this and it is so easy to use, better than any plastic tub out there."""
__label__neu	"""I have a 3 month old and have basically used the plastic tub a total of 3 times."""
__label__neu	"""The big tub is just so much easier and nicer and there isn't any preparation, everything is there, it's easy to fill and drain and always worked well with my first child."""
__label__pos	"""This pillow keeps my son safe and comfortable, it dries up really well and he can also lie in it on the bathroom floor while I fill the tub."""
__label__pos	"""My husband can even bath him and he looks really comfy in it."""
__label__pos	"""He lies snugly on it while I soap him up and don't have to worry about a slippery baby falling out my hands or hitting himself against the tub."""
__label__pos	"""Well worth the money!"""
__label__pos	"""I think I've tried all (at least most) breast milk bags, and these are worth the extra money -- my favorites."""
__label__pos	"""They are easy to pump directly into."""
__label__pos	"""For comparison, the First Years bags are flimsy plastic (one actually ripped); the Lansinoh bags are nice material but big and bulky (can't attach to pump mechanism)."""
__label__pos	"""Lansinoh claims ""can store flat,"" but so can the Medela bags."""
__label__pos	"""Lansinoh bags do hold more, but I don't find that to be an advantage (all I usually need is 5 oz at a time)."""
__label__pos	"""I do like the double zipper on Lansinoh, but with the Medela, all you need to do is check the seal by squeezing milk upward."""
__label__pos	"""I've never had a problem with Medela Pump & Save and would recommend these above all."""
__label__neu	"""I bought one used from a coworker."""
__label__pos	"""My first daughter loved the swing so I figured this would be a good investment."""
__label__pos	"""I love that the seat is more upright than laid back."""
__label__pos	"""It's easy to fold, lightweight and works wonderfully."""
__label__neg	"""The only thing I would change is the swing seems to move very slowly (I have new batteries)."""
__label__neu	"""Of course, I did get mine used so this could be due to that??"""
__label__pos	"""My 6 month old's favorite toy by far."""
__label__pos	"""I love that she is non toxic, no BPA or other bad chemicals."""
__label__pos	"""She has so many places to chew and she is the perfect size for my little one's hands."""
__label__pos	"""A must have!"""
__label__pos	"""I love this bag."""
__label__pos	"""It's cute, but not too cute."""
__label__pos	"""And, it's very functional."""
__label__pos	"""I just travelled alone with baby by plane across country and fit everything we both needed in this bag."""
__label__pos	"""The flaps across the top with the zipper on them can spread out to make the bag much bigger when needed or sag in and let the two sides of the bag come together for a smaller purse-like big, if you can picture what I mean."""
__label__pos	"""The side pockets are great for all my personal belongings since I don't care to also carry a purse these days."""
__label__neg	"""The Skip Hop diaper changing pad was a little too big and bulky to fit nicely in the outside pocket that I believe is made for that."""
__label__pos	"""But, my JJ Cole changing pad fits great in there."""
__label__pos	"""Overall, I""m very pleased."""
__label__neu	"""FOLLOW UP 6ISH MONTHS LATER: Bag has been awesome, big, stylish, and very functional, but I must have overloaded it and blown out the fabric."""
__label__neg	"""Fabric blew out in seemingly non-load-bearing place, which is strange."""
__label__neu	"""I'll try to get them to warranty it, at which time I'll follow up again."""
__label__neu	"""I am all about ease of clean, and this cover while very easy to clean it is not optimal to place it in the drier (even on low)."""
__label__neg	"""With each washing it got smaller and smaller and it made the contour of the pad malform a bit at the corners."""
__label__neu	"""My suggestion, don't put it in the drier and it stays perfect (learned with the 2nd one we bought)."""
__label__neu	"""I was given this toy at my baby shower by a relative with young children."""
__label__neu	"""I assumed her kids liked this toy and that's why she'd given us one (I hadn't requested it on our registry)."""
__label__neg	"""Unfortunately, our baby has never been interested in this toy."""
__label__neu	"""I'm rather surprised because her Leap Frog Learning Seat is one of her absolute favorite things."""
__label__neg	"""However, I can understand why she's not interested in the Dreamscapes Soother."""
__label__neg	"""Personally, I don't find that there's much to look at - the flat lighted pictures that spin around are nothing compared to the three-dimensional, moving fish and real bubbles in the Ocean Wonders Aquarium (my daughter's very favorite crib toy)."""
__label__neg	"""Moreover, the sound of the pictures moving is VERY loud."""
__label__neg	"""When we first used this toy (at night), my husband and I wondered if it was broken - that's how loud and grating the sound was."""
__label__neg	"""We figured out, however, that it's simply the noise of the pictures turning."""
__label__neg	"""Unfortunately, to cover up that horrible noise, we found we had to turn the volume up way too loud for sleeping purposes."""
__label__neg	"""Overall, I wish I'd kept the box because I am so dissatisfied with this toy that I would return it if I could."""
__label__neu	"""Our daughter started using this bouncer at about 2 months."""
__label__neu	"""First, she just stared at the fish and listened to the music."""
__label__neu	"""Gradually, she has begun playing with the swinging parts and she can make it work on the ""baby"" setting."""
__label__neg	"""Still, we have another bouncer that has hanging objects but no music and it seems to give her more active, thinking exploration than this bouncer."""
__label__pos	"""I bought this for my car - so far I haven't had any problems with suction, etc."""
__label__pos	"""My daughter seems to like it."""
__label__neg	"""I didn't get the fuzz or the odor with this as the other user did."""
__label__pos	"""I'm interested to see how it's waterproof because it's not lined with anything waterproof, but then I like that as an organic product."""
__label__pos	"""The mattress already has its plastic cover, I don't need yet more plastic!"""
__label__pos	"""It is waiting for baby to arrive so it's not tested but so far I'm pleased with it as a cover for the mattress."""
__label__pos	"""It's well constructed."""
__label__neu	"""I added this to my baby registry as a ""test"" to see if it was really worth buying a ""swaddle specific"" blanket."""
__label__pos	"""I'm so glad that I did, I use this constantly and ended up buying 2 more."""
__label__pos	"""My daughter is almost a year old now and I still use them, every night."""
__label__pos	"""My brother had 2 kids before me and was a HUGE swaddle fan so recommended it highly."""
__label__pos	"""This blanket is perfect for swaddling (it keeps the swaddle tight, very important!)"""
__label__pos	"""but it's also large so you can use this as a great cover for breast feeding, covering baby, floor cover, etc."""
__label__pos	"""We got these bottles because they are supposed to be the closest thing to breast feeding, and they advertise a 'slow-flow' nipple."""
__label__neg	"""Needless to say, the milk just ran down our baby's chin every time."""
__label__neg	"""The slow-flow is not slow enough for a baby who is accustomed to breast feeding and having to work at gettimg milk out."""
__label__neg	"""They are way too expensive and didn't work well for us."""
__label__pos	"""These bowls are great!"""
__label__pos	"""They are so colorful and cute!"""
__label__pos	"""I bought them today and they work great on my son's highchair tray."""
__label__pos	"""These will be most helpful when my son begins to feed himself, as he is starting to show interest in doing."""
__label__neg	"""The only draw back on the bowls is that they cannot be microwaved due to the permanently attached suction cup on the bottom."""
__label__pos	"""They are dishwasher safe though!"""
__label__pos	"""I think the sleep sacks are wonderful!"""
__label__pos	"""They wash great and kep baby very comfortable whilemaking it easy for night time changes."""
__label__pos	"""They are versatile for all weather temps too as can be layered over warmer jammies, onsies, etc...."""
__label__neg	"""Personally I think bottle warmers are a waste of money."""
__label__neg	"""If your baby is hungry they want to eat now and don't want to wait for a bottle to warm up in this thing."""
__label__neg	"""It takes too long."""
__label__neg	"""I got one for my shower and I'm so mad that I threw the box away because I wish I could return it."""
__label__neg	"""I have always just warmed the bottle in the microwave."""
__label__neu	"""So many people are against that but as long as you shake up the bottle before you feed the baby there's no problem."""
__label__neu	"""Only an idiot wouldn't check the temp before feeding their baby anyway."""
__label__neg	"""SAVE YOUR MONEY AND JUST USE THE MICROWAVE."""
__label__neg	"""It's so much faster!!"""
__label__neu	"""We bought this when my son was big enough to be stable in it."""
__label__pos	"""It helped give him standing time."""
__label__pos	"""Play with toys and it was convenient to feed him in."""
__label__pos	"""He loved to bounce side to side and it never got close to falling over."""
__label__pos	"""He also loved to bounce up and down."""
__label__neu	"""Unfortunately once they can move they no longer are interested in it and we have another useless piece of furniture to store but for the money (my mom got it for us) it was useful for a time."""
__label__pos	"""These toys are wonderful."""
__label__pos	"""They fit little, chubby hands and keep my son's interest."""
__label__pos	"""He loves the bright colors and he especially loves to teeth on the fish."""
__label__pos	"""The butterfly stays cold for at least an hour after taking it out of the freezer."""
__label__pos	"""He loves both sides of it and will talk it."""
__label__pos	"""These are also great to throw in the diaper bag, because they are small."""
__label__pos	"""We also keep at least one in the car for him to play with in his carseat."""
__label__pos	"""Definitely a 5 star product!"""
__label__pos	"""My son has had this seat since before birth and uses it everyday."""
__label__pos	"""He's been sitting up for months and still uses this chair."""
__label__neu	"""Of course, he's strapped into it for obvious safety reasons."""
__label__pos	"""I like the kickstand which reclines the chair for extra stability."""
__label__pos	"""My baby LIKES this bouncer."""
__label__pos	"""She likes to look at the fish and bubbles while sitting in it."""
__label__pos	"""The vibrations are pretty good too."""
__label__neu	"""The only thing that would make this bouncer better would be for it to rock on it's own when the baby moves."""
__label__neg	"""You have to use your foot or hand to jog the seat back and forth to calm the baby or to keep the baby entertained."""
__label__neg	"""And that could be a lot when you need to run and get things done."""
__label__pos	"""But then again I guess it would be a rocker and not a bouncer, so if you have time to sit in front of the baby and bounce the bouncer back and forth and sing this is great, if you have to get things done put the baby in the swing.."""
__label__pos	"""Nature's Touch is the BEST!"""
__label__neu	"""Want to get some house work done, but the baby wants you to be held?"""
__label__pos	"""Slap this carrier on and you can do anything!"""
__label__neu	"""When they're real little and have no neck control they have to face your chest."""
__label__neg	"""My baby screamed the entire time."""
__label__neg	"""I thought I had wasted my money on this thing."""
__label__pos	"""But at 2-3 months he was able to turn around and look at the world."""
__label__pos	"""And he has been cruising around with me ever since."""
__label__pos	"""This is the BEST crib sheet out there!"""
__label__pos	"""It can be simply used by itself by just fastening the straps to the sides of the crib or can be used with a more decorative sheet simply placed snugly in place over it."""
__label__pos	"""My daughter is now 6 months and has leaked out of her diaper on occassion, the mattress that she sleeps on cost around $120.00, so thanks to this sheet the mattress still looks the same as it did when we brougt it home."""
__label__pos	"""My 21 month old son has had this album since he was seven months old, has played with it daily and it has survived in excellent condition."""
__label__pos	"""He chews on it, throws it, and sleeps with it; the photos are very well protected."""
__label__pos	"""The thing I liked best about this album was watching my son progress from pointing out the cute animals to learing the sounds they make as well as thier colors, and then to recognizing the people in the photographs."""
__label__pos	"""This has become my son's comfort object."""
__label__pos	"""He sleeps with it, takes it to daycare, and had to have it during a short stay in the hospital."""
__label__pos	"""It is easy to clean and for that, I am very pleased."""
__label__neu	"""I was on the fence about buying this toy due to its price, but one day I went shopping at the farmer's market and EVERY baby had one."""
__label__pos	"""So I thought, heck, all these kids like it, why not give it a shot?"""
__label__pos	"""And you know what- my daughter does like it!"""
__label__pos	"""It smells rubbery (not plasticky) but that doesn't seem to dissuade the little ones."""
__label__pos	"""It has many parts that are easy for little hands to grip (all the legs and the neck), and good places of harder rubber to chew (the ears and whatever those little vestigial horns are between the ears), and it even squeaks like old-school dog toys."""
__label__pos	"""What's not to love?"""
__label__neg	"""Just the price!"""
__label__pos	"""While one does not need to purchase the BF bottle brush (Munchkin's is more than adequate - better even - at $3 or so), I've found the nipple brush is very useful."""
__label__neu	"""Munchkin's bottle/nipple brush Munchkin Bottle Nipple Brush -1 Piececonsists of stiff bristles."""
__label__pos	"""While this is fine for silicone nipples, BF's specialized vent has the aforementioned ""mini-nipple"" which is very delicate."""
__label__neu	"""I've always been afraid that even gentle brushing with the bristle brush would tear the slit (the silicone is very thin here)."""
__label__neg	"""Thus, if one wants BF's soft foam nipple brush (which does indeed work well), one will pony up $14.99 list for not only the nipple brush, but also the bottle brush."""
__label__neg	"""They are not sold separately."""
__label__neg	"""They are made of cheap foam with plastic handles - that's IT! - and they wear out quickly."""
__label__neg	"""Outrageous to all intelligent parents out there."""
__label__neg	"""The cost of producing these has to be infinitesimal."""
__label__neg	"""Why gouge the consumer for brushes to clean BF's bottles?"""
__label__neg	"""Insulting and greedy, and counterproductive to generating brand loyalty."""
__label__pos	"""My daughter really liked to use this product."""
__label__pos	"""She sucked the fruit right out and screamed for more."""
__label__pos	"""I wasn't something we needed to use for too long but for the time we did she really enjoyed it."""
__label__neu	"""We have 2 sets of twins, 8 months old and 3 years old."""
__label__neu	"""Surprizingly we dont have many gates, just 4, one for the top and bottom of each staircase."""
__label__pos	"""These work very well."""
__label__pos	"""They were easy to install and do not leave marks on teh walls."""
__label__pos	"""They are easy for me and my husband to open and close (even with babies on the hips) but too difficult for my 3 year olds to operate."""
__label__pos	"""They are very safe and hold up to much abuse, including my 3 year olds grabbing the bars and shaking it."""
__label__pos	"""It serves its purpose, though I didnt try it in a doorway."""
__label__pos	"""I dont need any others seeing tha tmy house is VERY baby proof."""
__label__pos	"""but these are nice looking easy to use and very sturdy."""
__label__pos	"""We registered for this product after hearing raves from other people."""
__label__neg	"""We could not be more disappointed."""
__label__neg	"""Among other things, we were never able to figure out how to get this thing to work."""
__label__neg	"""My husband and I have four masters degrees between us, and my father is an engineer."""
__label__neg	"""And yet we still could not figure out how to get this thing to work."""
__label__neg	"""Out of depseration, we took the genie to the local baby store and after 45 minutes even the staff could not figure this product out."""
__label__neg	"""How much genius does it take to make a diaper pail this complicated."""
__label__neg	"""We are much happier with the diaper champ."""
__label__pos	"""Positive Aspects:"""
__label__pos	"""1)  It LOOKS happier and more kid-friendly than most of the other options out there..."""
__label__pos	"""I didn't want to put my kids in some institutional-looking cage."""
__label__pos	"""2)  Easy to assemble/disassemble - but not so easy that the kids could do it"""
__label__pos	"""3)  Lightweight, so you can move it around the house without even having to take it apart"""
__label__pos	"""4)  Configures to all kinds of angles, so you can fit it where you need it"""
__label__pos	"""5)  Good door lock - don't think even older toddlers (under 3) could unlock it"""
__label__pos	"""6)  Comes with extensions..."""
__label__pos	"""and can accomodate as many as you need."""
__label__neg	"""Friendly Toys Little Playzone Extension KitDrawbacks:"""
__label__neg	"""1)  The built-in music buttons have REALLY annoying, short little songs - there is no way to turn the sounds off or even turn them down"""
__label__neg	"""2)  Lightweight (a pro and a con) - once your kids get any sort of strength, they can push the walls around, and even push the whole thing over."""
__label__neg	"""I don't know if this holds true if you use the suctions cups on a hard wood floor, as I only ever used it on carpet and grass"""
__label__neg	"""3)  As a whole, the toy panel is a bit of a disappointment - if I could find a similar playzone without the built-in toys, and pay less for it, I wouldn't miss the toy panel for a second (nor would my kids)."""
__label__pos	"""Our baby, now 5 months old, loves his Pupsqueak and has since he was 4 or 5 weeks old."""
__label__pos	"""The soft plush, the bright colors, that cute bark, the squeak, the rattle, those crinkly ears--what's not to love?"""
__label__pos	"""He loves to touch and pat it all over, pulling and grabbing each part to make all the sounds."""
__label__pos	"""He loves to chew on the attached bone and squeeze it to make the crinkle sound."""
__label__pos	"""Like all Lamaze toys, it's well designed and well made."""
__label__pos	"""It even has a handy clip on top of the head to attach it to your carrier, bouncy seat or diaper bag."""
__label__neg	"""The only negative is it must be spot cleaned; my baby drools all over it, so when I wash it, it's out of commission until it dries completely, which is usually the next day."""
__label__pos	"""But that's the same with all soft toys that can't be machine washed, so it's not a serious drawback."""
__label__pos	"""Baby is not nearly as gassy since we switched to these bottles."""
__label__pos	"""Also very easy to clean."""
__label__pos	"""I love Bumpkins bibs!"""
__label__pos	"""Washable, lightweight, quick-drying, great for home, restaurants, travel."""
__label__pos	"""Never had one stain, used them with beets, tomatoes, paint, food color, Easter egg dye, you name it (although after a few years, the white trim is just a little off-white now, but that is to be expected!)."""
__label__pos	"""I use this model for an art smock, but would absolutely bring it along for Christmas dinner or any other dress up occasion with a messy meal!"""
__label__pos	"""I have three different Bumpkins styles, this one, the one like this with short sleeves, and the regular bibs."""
__label__pos	"""I absolutely love them, best parenting investment ever!"""
__label__pos	"""This swing is excellent."""
__label__pos	"""We have had absolutely no problems with it."""
__label__pos	"""My DS used it for the first three months of his life A LOT!"""
__label__pos	"""Being able to swing front to back or side to side is great, if one doesn't work try the other."""
__label__pos	"""My son also loved the music, light and mobile."""
__label__neg	"""My son just turned six months old and we just put away the swing, not because of weight but because he is to much of a big boy to be in a swing (according to him)."""
__label__pos	"""I highly recommend this swing to anyone looking to buy one, you will not be sorry."""
__label__neu	"""Our 6 month old outgrew her 4 stage bath tub & I wasn't comfortable readjusting it to fit a toddler."""
__label__pos	"""This Eurobath is wonderful."""
__label__pos	"""It is VERY roomy & baby enjoys splashing around."""
__label__pos	"""There is plenty of room for her toys."""
__label__pos	"""It has a drain & I haven't had any problems with it."""
__label__pos	"""It seems like it would have been perfect to bathe an infant too (since it has the special design to do so), but I didn't have it at the time."""
__label__pos	"""I definitely recommend this tub!"""
__label__neg	"""I was going to buy a few Avent disposable bottles for travel, but having to buy separate nipples made it a waste of money."""
__label__pos	"""Then Avent came out with these!"""
__label__pos	"""I like how you can use the regular nipples and these are cheap enough you can just toss them (especially great when you find it two weeks later until the seat)."""
__label__pos	""":c)Also get the extra refill pack."""
__label__pos	"""You can use these all of the time."""
__label__pos	"""I also have the regular bottles, too, for home."""
__label__pos	"""Now that my baby has more dexterity, she loves to grab this and chew on it."""
__label__pos	"""I think once they hit the 6-month mark, they will enjoy it better."""
__label__neu	"""I bought this pump when my son was 3 weeks old."""
__label__pos	"""I've been pumping fairly regularly for 4 months now and wouldn't think of using anything else."""
__label__pos	"""I've returned to work and my son is exclusively breastfed."""
__label__neu	"""I had the idea that I would use this for the occasional pumping to get me started and then I would buy a hospital grade pump."""
__label__pos	"""I won't use anything else after my sucess with this pump."""
__label__pos	"""I can pump an 8-9oz bottle in 10 to 15 minutes with no problem."""
__label__pos	"""I recommend this pump to anyone who plans on nursing - short term or long term."""
__label__neg	"""Using any cellphone with 15 feet of either the monitor or the receiver creates a horrible interference noise."""
__label__neg	"""So if you ever plan on using your cellphone while your baby is sleeping, this isn't the monitor for you."""
__label__neu	"""I have several of these - one under the sheet on the crib and one under the sheet to my pack and play."""
__label__pos	"""LOVE THEM!"""
__label__pos	"""Great item to have!"""
__label__pos	"""So glad we got this adapter for our UppaBaby stroller!"""
__label__pos	"""It's an absolute necessity and I couldn't imagine not having it."""
__label__pos	"""It makes life so much easier being able to take the baby car seat out of the car and just click it on to the stroller."""
__label__pos	"""It makes everything so compact compared to the other travel systems out there i.e. Graco, etc."""
__label__pos	"""When the car seat adapter is connected, you will have plenty of room to get to the under carriage basket."""
__label__pos	"""The car seat is also at a great raised height so baby is nice and close to you."""
__label__neu	"""We are using the Chicco KeyFit 30 car seat."""
__label__pos	"""Nice thing as well is that the stroller will fold with no problems while the adapter is attached."""
__label__pos	"""The adapter is easily attached and detached from the stroller for times when you want to put on the other Uppababy parts like the bassinet or seat."""
__label__pos	"""I love this ""baby gate."""""
__label__pos	"""I actually bought it because my 75 lb labradoodle was jumping over our other baby gate on a daily basis & I wanted to keep him out of our dining room."""
__label__pos	"""This is the tallest baby gate I've seen - definitely too tall for my dog to get over."""
__label__pos	"""I also like that you can open the gate & walk through."""
__label__pos	"""It's too complicated of a mechanism for kids to figure out (not that they'd be able to reach it...), but easy for parents to use & can be done with one hand."""
__label__neg	"""While easy to do, it is a bit cumbersome to open/close the gate, since you have to push a button while you lift the plastic handle, & then you have to lift the gate up as you push it open."""
__label__pos	"""I don't need to use the gate often, though, so it's OK with me."""
__label__pos	"""Although it does take a bit longer to open/close, it is definitely much more secure than my other baby gates."""
__label__pos	"""It was really easy to install, too."""
__label__pos	"""I thought the price was a bit steep for a step stool, but man is it well made!"""
__label__pos	"""This step stool will not budge, with all the rubber grips it has."""
__label__pos	"""It's also a lot nicer looking after it's been used a while because the black rubber on the top wears so nicely."""
__label__pos	"""I looked at another step stool in the BRU store when I bought this, and its rubber already looked icky just from people testing it out."""
__label__pos	"""This Baby Bjorn one is also very strong, even for heavier children."""
__label__pos	"""I'm very pleased!"""
__label__pos	"""Certainly not worth $40. It's cute because it matches my baby's stars/moonbeams nursery theme but it's not the best quality."""
__label__neg	"""You have to assemble the hanging moon & stars yourself which is a bit tedious."""
__label__pos	"""I have to say, my baby loves looking up at it & enjoys the music."""
__label__pos	"""He kicks his legs & coos like crazy."""
__label__neg	"""But..."""
__label__neg	"""the music plays only a short time, which is a pain because I have to keep winding it."""
__label__neg	"""A mobile should have music that lasts longer than this!"""
__label__pos	"""I call this the best $40 I ever spent since it is so versatile."""
__label__pos	"""It's one of the things I can't do without now."""
__label__pos	"""I used it when my son was a newborn to carry him around the house - it gave me back my mobility since I could carry him around and do things such as make my own breakfast and eat!"""
__label__pos	"""My son is now 4 months and I still use it."""
__label__pos	"""I don't bother taking a stroller anywhere I just tie the wrap and go."""
__label__pos	"""He LOVES it."""
__label__pos	"""He gets a great vantage point plust it gives him the nice rocking motion they love."""
__label__pos	"""Even when he's fussy - I put him in this and he calms down."""
__label__pos	"""You cannot go wrong with this."""
__label__pos	"""Tying it is also a breeze - I did it the first time and it was so easy."""
__label__pos	"""Only advice - tighter is better so tie it as tightly as you can and it'll be so much easier and safer with baby inside."""
__label__pos	"""Enjoy!"""
__label__pos	"""I admit it: I am impressed with Avent bottles!"""
__label__pos	"""They are easily one of the baby products capable of handling extremes without a blink."""
__label__pos	"""Example: microwave sterilize them and after a couple of minutes, pour a stream of recently boiled water; mix with formula and put next to the ice bin in the freezer for five minutes."""
__label__pos	"""Do this with your average bottle a few times and be ready to say bye-bye to them, but Avent bottles hold on strong and in the process also happen to offer the best bibs in the market (the ones that best mimic the nipple, thus giving your baby the least gas, if you feed the bottle perpendicular to his/her mouth)."""
__label__pos	"""No wonder they've been voted among the best baby products for several years in a row!"""
__label__neu	"""My son has had acid reflux since he was a few days old, and after dealing with 2 months of severe spitting up I finally saw an ad in a magazine and bought these bottles."""
__label__pos	"""What a lifesaver they have been!"""
__label__pos	"""Within days, he was spitting up less and had less gas too."""
__label__pos	"""It was such a noticeable difference that it had to be the bottles."""
__label__pos	"""I could tell using Dr. Brown's that my son wasn't taking in as much air as he was with the Avent bottles we had been using."""
__label__neu	"""I do suggest, however, that you read carefully and follow the directions included with these bottles."""
__label__neu	"""For example, if you are going to put them in a bottle warmer, you MUST take the nipple off first or the liquid becomes piping hot and even explodes through the top."""
__label__pos	"""Other than that, they are very easy to care for."""
__label__pos	"""I thought cleaning them was no more difficult than any other bottles..."""
__label__pos	"""the extra steps are worth it to me."""
__label__neu	"""Our daughter has severe acid reflux that has been treated with medication since she was a month old."""
__label__neu	"""And she's on lactofree formula."""
__label__pos	"""But even with the meds and special formula she still had a terrible time with gas and spitting up until we found these!"""
__label__pos	"""We started with Avent and loved them until we found the Playtex Ventaire but Dr. Brown's beats them both hands down!"""
__label__pos	"""They stopped her spitting up and gas almost instantly and she is now coming off of her medication."""
__label__pos	"""They work wonderfully!"""
__label__pos	"""All the pieces are a pain to keep up with and the dishwasher rarely gets the inserts clean but they are well worth the handwashing."""
__label__neg	"""We also had trouble finding the replacement parts for the wide neck bottles."""
__label__neg	"""But we were able to orer some directly from the company."""
__label__neg	"""Also make sure not to overfill them or they will leak."""
__label__pos	"""But the pros far outweigh all of the cons!"""
__label__pos	"""I received this for my baby room at my shower, I love it so much."""
__label__pos	"""The wipes fit perfectly on one side of the caddy, and we always have diapers and other items on the other side and in the drawer."""
__label__pos	"""It is nice to be able to grab it and go, and also to have all of my diaper changing things in one area."""
__label__pos	"""If I could give it 6 stars, I would."""
__label__pos	"""It was the first toy my son paid any attention to at all, starting around when he was 3 weeks old."""
__label__pos	"""Just when I was starting to feel desperate for him to have some fun on his own, I turned on this mobile and bingo!"""
__label__pos	"""I was shocked."""
__label__pos	"""He enjoyed the sights and sounds for 20 minutes!"""
__label__pos	"""Since he loved this mobile so much, I tried another mobile."""
__label__pos	"""No dice."""
__label__pos	"""He only liked this one."""
__label__pos	"""Something about it absolutely mesmerized him."""
__label__pos	"""We have had it now for months and I have moved it to be used more as ""nursery decor"" since he's too old to have it where he might pull it down."""
__label__pos	"""This is a wonderful product."""
__label__pos	"""Great gift for a shower, or for entertaining a very picky little baby!"""
__label__pos	"""This is a great bath toy organizer."""
__label__pos	"""It is the first and only one I have purchased after reading several reviews."""
__label__pos	"""It sticks perfectly on the tub and has been up for at least 2 months with no problems."""
__label__pos	"""It fit all my son's toys easily with room for more."""
__label__pos	"""I like that it is easily washable and can be taken off the wall with the little plastic hooks."""
__label__pos	"""It seems very sturdy and would probably hold a lot more weight if we had heavier toys."""
__label__pos	"""A great buy!"""
__label__pos	"""***************Update- 2 years later******************We've been using this for 2 years now."""
__label__pos	"""It has never fallen off the wall!"""
__label__pos	"""We have used it in 3 different tubs."""
__label__pos	"""The longest we have left it on is probably 1 year."""
__label__neu	"""I have washed it in the washing machine a couple of times, just to make sure it is not getting gross."""
__label__pos	"""It held up just fine in the washer."""
__label__neu	"""(I did not put it in the dryer, though!)"""
__label__pos	"""It still holds tons of toys and it keeps things looking neat and tidy."""
__label__pos	"""I still think it was a great buy!"""
__label__pos	"""Unquestionably the best bathtub to keep your little baby secure while you use both hands to bathe him."""
__label__pos	"""I was so nervous to give my baby a bath by myself, but after we went and bought this tub, I've never been more confident about it."""
__label__pos	"""The hammock makes him feel very secure."""
__label__pos	"""Great product!"""
__label__neg	"""I found the nipple to be way too hard for my newborn son to suck."""
__label__neg	"""I then ran out and got the Munchkin Tri-flow."""
__label__pos	"""You can change how fast the milk flows out of the bottle as you baby grows and the nipple is much softer!"""
__label__neu	"""Munchkin also sells just the nipple that is compatable with the Avent bottle."""
__label__pos	"""So, if you've already purchased the avent bottles your money has not gone to waste!"""
__label__neg	"""The only problem is that the Tri-flow is still fairly new and is very hard to find!"""
__label__neu	"""Good Luck!"""
__label__pos	We're looking forward to using the aquarium high chair later on as well.
__label__neg	Would not buy again.
__label__pos	It turned out to be perfect.
__label__pos	Handy, Cute, Entertaining
__label__neu	With my first child her swaddling always came undone when she was carried or being passed around to friends and family.
__label__neg	Great, but not for us
__label__neg	Potentially unsafe plastic!
__label__neu	(1) cleaner (2) adjustable size.
__label__neu	We've had these locks on both our toilets since the baby was just over a year old.
__label__pos	He also struggled badly with reflux and had to sleep at a 45% angle at all times and this swing was one of the few places where he would sleep for long stretches.
__label__neu	I really wanted to like and keep this tub, and at first, I did!
__label__pos	perfect
__label__neu	We bought this for our infant carrier and it hangs very low and close to our baby's face.
__label__neu	The batteries seemed to last for a while, and you can set the volume and the length of play.
__label__pos	He seemed to delight in the fact that by waving around his arms, he could hit the toys and cause the music and lights to go off.
__label__pos	Plus, the fabric is so lightweight (but not sheer) and BREATHABLE (perfect for hot, humid weather).
__label__neg	The plastic case is awful
__label__pos	GREAT MONITOR @ Great price
__label__neu	There's no way of getting out of this one.
__label__pos	Great for breastfeeding beginners!
__label__pos	Easy to Use
__label__pos	Best pack n' play!
__label__neu	The only thing keeping me from rating 5 stars is the battery.
__label__pos	I liked that it could be folded, but I never actually put it away unless we have company since I use it daily.
__label__neg	"All I got is that ""the materials in our products meet global phthalate and BPA requirements"", a remarkable statement given that, to the best of my knowledge, there are no such global requirements (every country has their own widely varying safety standards, and the US regulations in particular are ridiculously out of date with the current research that suggests that even small amounts of BPA are harmful)."
__label__pos	Love it, love it, love it!
__label__neu	I purchased this product 2 years ago for my son.
__label__neg	Would have given this 5 stars but this is not as soft as I had hoped...maybe expecting alot from terry cloth.
__label__pos	Next day I picked up at BRU (I had to get the extender peice too) and installed it.WONDERFUL.
__label__neu	Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it would be nice to have a feature that allows the monitor to switch over to the room where noise is recognized.
__label__neu	I got this sterilizer after the birth of my daughter and trying to wash all my avent bottles and nipples.
__label__neg	This rack leaves alot to be desired to say the least.
__label__pos	My DD is always interested in her even tho she hangs off of her car seat all the time and she sees her often!
__label__pos	It plays really nice, soothing music along with nature sounds.
__label__neu	We love the sounds although the Whale recording is a short loop and not as good as we had hoped.
__label__neu	Nice but Organic?
__label__pos	Good brush for little ones to carry around
__label__neg	What a waste of money.
__label__pos	Very sensitive, but has a control for that as well.
__label__pos	So rarely can you find everyone you need all in one product.
__label__neu	After sterilizing it, I just leave it in the sterilizer.
__label__pos	I LOVE this sheep!
__label__pos	I don't know what we would do with out it.
__label__pos	Easy to change bags.Stable when changing bags (others are not!!!)
__label__pos	Speedy way to sterilize
__label__pos	I like this video monitor, it has good sound and good video.
__label__pos	I used it every day until he could sit unassisted.
__label__pos	This is a great diaper pail.
__label__pos	Works great for me
__label__pos	She doesn't like it when we don't have it with us and she has to lay on my boney arm!
__label__pos	I bought 2 packs of 4 and used them constantly.
__label__pos	This item is so helpful.
__label__pos	We love this sterilizer.
__label__neu	Comparison with regular Gerber premiums
__label__pos	Everything else in the set was used and I even bought an additional matching blanket.This set is wonderful for a boy or a girl.
__label__pos	This is a cute distracting toy.
__label__pos	This sheet fits my Graco pack n play well and feels soft and cozy against the skin.
__label__neg	Check out Nicki's Diapers (google it) for much more selection and better prices.
__label__neu	Its best to put the bags of breastmilk in here, it warms super fast.
__label__neu	When my daughter first came home I used them under her, on my counter near the sink to sponge bathe her.
__label__neg	Leaks?
__label__pos	My daughter is now 10-months-old and larger than average but I can still swaddle her with fabric to spare.
__label__pos	After using it for only 2 days, my nipple had healed sufficiently, and I no longer needed to use the shield.
__label__pos	Anyway, nice to have at least a couple in this set to use on bottles I already had.
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT!!!
__label__pos	It is a very safe seat and easy to install.
__label__pos	She loves it, it keeps her busy, and I get some time to do a chore or two around the house.
__label__neu	!
__label__neg	However, it only entertained him for a couple of months because they get over the need to jump.
__label__neg	They do not fit together well either.
__label__pos	The price was right.
__label__pos	Indispensible, Portable and Affordable
__label__pos	Especially good for traveling
__label__neg	But it's so noisy!
__label__pos	Absolutely L...o....v...e this pillow.
__label__pos	It is very quiet as well.
__label__neu	You get what you pay for
__label__pos	This product has not only made bottle cleaning easy but it also allows for a convenient place to store them.
__label__pos	Now that it's together I can't wait for baby to try it.
__label__pos	THIS PRODUCT IS VERY EASY TO USE AND PERFECT FOR TRAVELING BUT THE 2 STINKY THINGS ABOUT IT IS THAT THE BASKET IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET TO WHEN THE CARSEAT IS ATTATCHED.
__label__neu	Then just slipped it back up and clipped it again when putting it back together.
__label__pos	SO CUTE!
__label__neu	Just flip the handle and the diaper is gone!Now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will!
__label__pos	It really makes baby comfortable.
__label__pos	I keep my warmer by the changing pad, and I always have very warm, moist wipes to tend to my baby...just like a gentle wash-cloth!
__label__neg	They are still very cute from a distance, just be forewarned about the quality!
__label__pos	But it is convenient and compact and it does do it's job even on the wideneck bottles.
__label__pos	It's especially helpful since she has reflux, because it keeps her propped up at an angle.On a side note, she loves the aquarium crib soother too.
__label__neg	My baby was only 2 months and I already had to move the water tub out of the bigger tub to make room for baby, and my baby's legs were still cramped.
__label__neg	It's terrible.I sat for about 15 minutes trying to pump either breast & I think I succeeded in getting a drop to appear on one nipple!
__label__neg	Our baby loves to kick on the changing table, but she has reflux and kicking flat generates a lot of spitup, plus it doesn't allow us much freedom.
__label__pos	It says that it holds about 20 diapers, but when your baby is little, and using diapers through size 2, you can turn them sideways so that you can actually fit in twice as many in two rows instead of just one.
__label__pos	This is GREAT if you have an infant and toddler!
__label__pos	I love that you can attach this to a crib, or when your baby gets older they can simply snuggle it.
__label__pos	"Also, especially if it is a ""big boy"", like ours, having him on it makes it easier to hold him."
__label__neu	Still, I wipe it down and run it through the dishwasher every once in a while, so no biggie.
__label__neu	For additional [money] you get a few more extra items, all secured in elastic loops in a compact pouch.
__label__neg	Even the slow-flow nipples were too fast for my 1 week old.
__label__pos	The vibration soothes her to sleep.
__label__neu	There are several different materials on the quilt, which adds texture.
__label__pos	We highly recommend this to all moms and dads' cars as well as grandmas and grandpas too!
__label__neu	It took me 2 months to fully recover.
__label__neu	She ride both faceing in and out.
__label__pos	I just hold it further away from her and she likes to look at it.
__label__pos	I love how much cushion is all around.
__label__pos	It is also important to note that the Snuzzler meets all official flammability requirements.
__label__neu	My 2nd daughter is currently 4 months old.
__label__neg	We hated that thing!
__label__neu	There are screw on handles and sippy tops you can buy.
__label__neg	There is one spot where the blue paint peeled just a bit.
__label__neu	It goes in the washer and the dryer.
__label__neu	I've used it several times to take him for a walk, and I've also worn it when my husband and I have gone to an art fair.
__label__pos	These are the perfect size for my 6 month old's hands.
__label__pos	I know as he feels better he is going to enjoy his new & safe play space even more.Thank you Amazon for this colorful playpen choice at the lowest price and your excellent service.
__label__neu	!
__label__neg	It takes a while to get it on, wrapped, and cinched where its comfortable, so slinging it on and off is not only not an option, you tend to dread the idea.Another point I will add is I used this right after having my baby, so I still had that 6 month pregnant-looking belly.
__label__pos	SO BEAUTIFUL!
__label__neg	~*My baby used to sweat in 25 degree weather with just his clothes and this bundle me.
__label__pos	It is also good to help them sit up later.
__label__pos	Perfect for the park, beach, or even at amusement parks to stake out your place.
__label__pos	Other than that, I have had no issues.
__label__neu	I rather prepare a few carrots, a few apples and oranges, and other small recipes, than have a whole lot of one thing.
__label__neu	This is one of those rare occasions.
__label__neu	We initially bought this booster because we were going to be travelling abroad and had no way to get a high chair to where we were going (expensive, and cumbersome).
__label__neu	my son couldnt care less about this teether.
__label__neg	What a perfect place for mildew.
__label__neg	They do still tend to spit up and have alot of gas from the other end, so I'm not sure about how much gas these bottles actually reduce.They are rather time consuming to clean because of all the parts.
__label__pos	Best Bottles!
__label__pos	He's napping in it right now.
__label__neg	Then we tried the blue swivel seat, The whole thing flipped over with her in it and our tub was not textured, all she was doing was kicking her feet.
__label__neg	I wouldn't recommend if you're trying to child proof from toddlers.
__label__pos	The lights are a little bright--but the monitor works well with our two story house.
__label__pos	expensive, but one of the items i use at least every other day.
__label__pos	This tub has gave me so much confidence that after the first bath, I didn't need to ask my husband to stand around, because all the nervousness was gone... the person who created this design had new mothers like me in mind... thank you, thank you, thank you...
__label__pos	Nice product...
__label__pos	These blankets are simply perfect and exactly what I was looking for!!
__label__pos	He does like to just chill out in it especially later in the evening as it gets closer to his bedtime.As others have mentioned it does swing very fast even on the lowest setting.
__label__pos	After having it spit up on and stained, it zipped off and washed up beautifully!
__label__neg	The con is that you either have to get your child to hold still while you sweep it across their temple/forehead, or you have to learn to be quick and hold your hand steady while the child moves.
__label__neu	Hard to find item...
__label__neu	But even if you aren't successful... who cares?
__label__pos	Life is a lot easier when you have this swing.
__label__pos	use this all the time!
__label__pos	She's 4 months old and we still use it.
__label__pos	The pads in the tub are soft and they are mold-resistant.
__label__pos	I like the terry cloth on the inside.
__label__pos	The vibrating seat puts him to sleep every time too.
__label__pos	I know, that's awfully old to be swaddled, but she has severe eczema and during a flare-up, these are wonderful at keeping her hands restricted (at least for a while) and calming her down.
__label__neu	Does it have all of the bells and whistles the Bugaboo does?
__label__pos	The safest option!
__label__neu	I always wrapped my daughters arms accross her chest because she liked to suck her fingers.
__label__pos	My milk supply was never huge so this was the only pump that allowed me to even get one bottle's worth of milk.I bought a cheaper one first but ended up wasting my money because it took forever to even get one ounce.
__label__pos	SUCCESS!
__label__neu	You can see everything that your child is doing.
__label__pos	It worked great!
__label__neu	You can use it in a tub or sink, but the other infant tub works best for me.
__label__pos	The tray is dishwasher safe and the whole seat is very easy to clean without troublesome nooks and crannies to trap caked on baby food.
__label__pos	Plus, having the matt ensures we always have a clean surface for our baby's food, and makes cleaning up and leaving very quick and easy when mealtimes are over.
__label__pos	I thought that the loud bubble motor sounds would bother her, but it has been just the opposite.
__label__pos	I love that it is portable, it can convert to a freestanding bassinet, also serve as a changing table, and later a playpen!
__label__pos	My mom bought one for her house and after I saw how much my son liked it I immediately went out and bought one for myself.
__label__pos	Love it!
__label__pos	Although I didn't really need the mesh part (for when you do sponge baths - it's just easier to do on a towel), we really enjoy this tub.
__label__pos	I bought this for my new daughter and she seems to love it.
__label__neg	I found it to be a bit hard so I purchased a little pad and cut it to fit.
__label__neu	You must jiggle it to make it work- Static/noise appearing in the signal when nothing else has changed (e.g.
__label__pos	But the best part are the clearly marked nipples.
__label__neu	I know I will be using these for a LONG time.
__label__pos	I wanted something that didn't require batteries, but something that would require her attention and help develop her senses.She absolutely loves this mobile.
__label__neg	I gave up after a few weeks and just took the unit off the organizer, and super-glued a regular wipe container on top of the organizer, that I just keep buying refills for.
__label__neu	If you buy this it could go either way.
__label__neg	It is rechargable, but Phillips had to send me a replacement because battery life was terrible and the replacement isn't any better.
__label__pos	This mirror works great in the back of our compact car and in the back of our large truck.
__label__neu	okay gate
__label__pos	This bib is nice because it's 100% plastic and surface washable.
__label__pos	it took me about three nights to find my favorite position with the pillow, but now i use it every night.
__label__pos	I love it as well!
__label__pos	I put them on her feet and she loves them.
__label__neu	... what can I say... Online, these baskets looked adorable and the review was a good one.
__label__pos	A blessing for cracked nipples!
__label__pos	Awesome!
__label__pos	I like to go shopping with her in it so that my hands are free.
__label__neu	"And to Todd Peterson ""tmphuskers"" who was/is cutting after each diaper...um...you don't do that."
__label__neu	They are very hard plastic.
__label__neu	Towels do not and are usually cotton which is extremely flamible.- It is now 8 months later.
__label__pos	It doesn't take up a lot of space and is super easy to travel with, the detachable play tray is awesome and my little one loves it.
__label__pos	Great, but watch your kiddo
__label__pos	i have not had any technical problems with it so far, 3 weeks of use, so i keep my fingers crossed.over all it's a very nice mobile, and having two kids, i've been through quite a few, still haven't found the perfect one, but this is the closest i've found to perfect.
__label__pos	I LOVE this!!
__label__pos	I had a premie and it fits her fine.
__label__neu	After reviewing many online reviews for tubs, I chose this one for my registry.
__label__neu	It might not be appealing to some beacuse of its plain look but I keep mine in the corner next to my crib.
__label__neu	I was given this as a baby shower gift.
__label__pos	I appreciate that the sterilizer doesnt take up much cupboard space and holds alot of bottles, nipples,pacifiers, etc.
__label__neg	First of all, and the greatest problem, my son freaked out when I put him inside of this.
__label__pos	Our baby started out with the Flutter & Chime bouncy chair (love this chair also) but at 3 months she started to pull her head up and I worried she would soon tip it over.
__label__pos	Best in its category!
__label__neg	So he'd play for about 30 secs then run off, waste of money for us.
__label__pos	"A fitted sheet for the cosleeper's ""mattress"" is included, and it is quite soft material compared to other sheets on the market.If you are tight on space in your bedroom, I recommend the mini version."
__label__neu	It didn't take long after bringing home my baby to start noticing the squeek, squeek, squeek when the swing is in motion.
__label__neg	I am keeping 2 as they get the water out ok, others ended up in a garbage can.
__label__neu	I have never had this problem, maybe it was corrected?
__label__pos	Great swing
__label__pos	I am pleased that I can avoid cold wipes especially in the middle of the night or after a particuarly bad BM.
__label__pos	So easy to use and much more accurate than the ear thermometers (dont EVER buy one of those, theyre a complete waste of money and dangerous to your baby by being so inaccurate!!)
__label__pos	It is great for when I have to shop alone, because I don't have to worry about putting his infant car seat into a shopping cart, which gives me extra room for purchases.
__label__neg	The Dr. Brown's were even worse becasue of the inside pieces.We never really were able to get stable enough to use in the folded position and we were never able to get anyting to hang on the hooks without falling either.
__label__neg	I really want to use this sling, but I feel like he's either too deeply inside the sling and he will suffocate or by adding a blanket underneath him, he's too close to the edge and will tumble out.
__label__neg	It was a disaster (think screaming, cold, baby).
__label__neu	We just use the hottest water that comes out of the tap, and it is about 130 degrees F, the milk is warm in a few minutes even from frozen.
__label__pos	I am going today to buy two more for him to use at daycare.
__label__pos	In addition, the design allows you to use the set through your child's toddlers year.
__label__neg	And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used.As she entered into toddlerhood we started having some bad diapers just becasue of her cutting teeth and diet changes.
__label__pos	What a great concept.
__label__neu	And it seems like the more weight he gains the more creeks there are.
__label__neu	She is also 26 inches now and just barely fits in it.
__label__pos	But to be honest I didn't try any other type of a bottle since this one works so well.
__label__pos	This swing is worth the money.
__label__pos	The company is great too.
__label__pos	It is a great way to get more use out of those bottles.I noticed that there are extra parts available for this pump.
__label__pos	I have read other reviews about the safety issues of this chair, but when used properly for the appropriate age - it is very safe!!
__label__pos	It is one of the few things I would not want to live without.
__label__pos	It is so easy to put on.
__label__pos	This one is truly outstanding and so much more attractive than the set I had liked before.
__label__pos	I also find it safer to use over the microwave sterilizer which i think can leech the plastic..especially not everything I have is bpa free.5 stars undoubtedly!
__label__neg	Cute, but that's about the extent of it
__label__neu	Well I did and I am completly satisfied.
__label__neu	Also, moisture seeped in between the handle and I suppose mold is forming now--I wouldn't know though.
__label__neg	It leaked and it was not a good size for my little man.
__label__neg	The only thing I was not too thrilled about was the mattress it comes with.
__label__pos	Unlike all the others, it zippers up simply for storage and comes with its own straps so you don't have to put those yucky store ones on your baby.
__label__neg	Very frustrating!
__label__neu	I keep this in the bathroom at all times.
__label__neu	Strangely enough, so does my 4 yr old, who I had to locate and retrieve the toys from several times the first day.
__label__pos	The materials are very soft to the touch and the color scheme is not achingly ugly.
__label__neg	It is really better suited for a pet than a baby or toddler.
__label__pos	Cheap but well loved toy in our home!
__label__pos	I like that I can go into small shops or the park without taking a bulky infant car seat.
__label__neg	They work pretty well, but after awhile my little guy figured out how to just push it down so that it opens up.
__label__pos	I bought this for my son when he was about a month or so old, and he really liked it.
__label__neu	Our rolling carry-on is old and did not feel stable enough with all that weight, so I just strapped on the car seat (Evenflo Triumph Advance Deluxe Convertible) and usually used my sling to carry my son.
__label__neu	I don't know about everyone else, but I only run my dishwasher at most every other day, and I didn't have enough bottles to last that long when she was eating every couple of hours.
__label__pos	The padding on the strap is great - very plush, and has a no-slide grip - kind of like felt, but not exactly.
__label__pos	The price was unbeatable and I didnt realize when I bought it that it converts to a toddler bed and it came with a trundle drawer which was a nice little surprise.
__label__pos	I use these all the time!
__label__neg	can't get it just right
__label__pos	At 6 months they still remained a favorite because they were the perfect teething toy.
__label__pos	I love the tempurature feature, we heat with a pellet stove and it makes it easy for me to monitor at night that the kids rooms are warm enough.
__label__pos	Plus, it's pretty!
__label__pos	A friend of mine suggested this tub because of the &quot hammock feature.&quot  Your baby is cradled in a &quot hammock&quot  that attaches to the tub, making it super easy to bathe your newborn.
__label__pos	It may not work for everyone, but for the first few months, it was a lifesaver for us, AND NO TEARS!!
__label__pos	It doubled as a toy when he was in the car seat.
__label__neu	My newest technique is simply to use tap water already at my baby's favorite temperature and put it in a thermos.
__label__pos	Would be nice if the white container was made with a little cushion for the small tush, but it's nice in that it's easy to clean and easy for the little ones to sit on.
__label__pos	It distributes the weight well.It also made is possible to hold my daughter at the same time (in my arms on in the Baby Bjorn).Good product!The only complaint is the space (which hasn't been a problem yet).
__label__neu	Anyhow...
__label__neu	"The ""pouch"" part of it is pretty useless, but it doesn't matter."
__label__neg	However, the spray button is the biggest PAIN!!!
__label__pos	Spend A Little More For This Slipcover!!
__label__pos	I really wish they made muslin blankets for adults (maybe they do?
__label__neg	The insulating bag rips!
__label__pos	Absolutely adorable!
__label__pos	This is the greatest thing that you can get!
__label__pos	:-)
__label__pos	I highly recommend this.
__label__pos	When folded down on the stroller it is very flat.
__label__pos	This sterilizer is absolutely wonderful, especially if you take your baby on the road, i.e.
__label__pos	I purchased this rocker to get more use from it, and I am very pleased.
__label__pos	I highly recommend this for babies learning to use sippy cup.
__label__pos	They are LARGE, which is what I love best.
__label__pos	Worth the money, for us at least.
__label__pos	I love looking at this swing  it's enchanting.
__label__neu	We've had the toilets locked so long that it's never paid off for him to try to play in there and he can't get into it even if he tries.I have to get more, I broke one on accident.
__label__neg	!UPDATE:Discontinued use after calcium deposits and slight odor.
__label__neu	My 12 month old has no problems sitting in it.
__label__neg	There is room for 2 large bottles, but i think it would be better to just buy a lunch bag and use it with removable freezer packs that take up less space.
__label__pos	But it was an amazing asset for us for months, so I'd still consider buying it again...
__label__pos	This is the only bottle our family uses, we used them for our son and now our newborn little girl.
__label__neg	BEWARE-Not like the old spouts
__label__neu	I do NOT like the warmer, but the organizer is fine.
__label__pos	It pumps pretty quickly and is easy to travel with.
__label__neu	I ordered the larger one in the cotton version.
__label__pos	Perfect for the Busy Mom
__label__pos	My 3-week old loves the Baby Einstein Play Gym!
__label__neu	We had a first years tub for our two older sons, but when Fisher Price came out with the Aquarium tub, we just had to get it.
__label__neu	No matter how well I swaddled him with receiving blankets, he would wiggle his way out.
__label__neu	I can't imagine going home from the hospital without being able to see our newborn along the way.
__label__pos	The cushioning on the kneeler is awesome and I also really like the elbow rest.The hanging organizer has two pockets which fit our daughters bathwash and bubble bath.
__label__pos	I would not recommend this as the only stroller you own, but is perfect for a second car or for grandma's house.
__label__neg	This leads me to believe that the plastic is indeed unsafe.
__label__pos	It's cute, soft, comfortable and does the job.Some people think that these harnesses are treating your kid like a pet.
__label__pos	What's great about this product is that you can adjust it to anyone's needs.
__label__pos	Considering the age of them I think that they've been a good value for us.
__label__pos	And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space.
__label__neu	My baby is due in 8 weeks and I just set up the cosleeper by myself.
__label__neg	Baby destroyed.
__label__pos	This product was a real life-saver for me!
__label__pos	This one has nice music (ok...it is not the best music ever, but he's a baby and it is calming enough) and the screen makes lovely light pictures for him to look at.So far...this mobile has been great!
__label__neg	As for the starter kit, it's odd that this is the only time you can get the flat lids that fit the bottle (for freezing or refrigerating without the nipple on).
__label__pos	It holds lots of diapers and I do not have to spend money on refill bags.
__label__pos	Great new bathtub!
__label__neu	I would pick her up, feed her and place her back to sleep without ever leaving my bed.
__label__pos	Great Color and Great Set
__label__neu	It was a difficult first baby shots day and he was hurting on both legs.
__label__pos	Greast monitor with no interference!
__label__pos	My baby was able to nurse just fine while I was wearing this.
__label__pos	Awesome mirror
__label__pos	Ok, once its on and done, I love it.
__label__neu	and theres still empty pockets.
__label__pos	Great Nightlight!
__label__pos	If you intend to go back to work, this is not the pump for you, but for everyone else I'd say this is a wise investment.
__label__pos	We have used it since she was able to take a bath, and she's 4 months old.
__label__neu	In hindsight though, we could just fill up the bottom of the sink with hot water.
__label__pos	It now has a system to cut the bag on the inside of the pail, which is nice, and it has a lock for the inner lid of the pail.
__label__neu	Stylish but big
__label__neg	This version is too thin to serve as either a burp cloth or for diapering.
__label__pos	My baby still loves it at 9 months!
__label__neg	What a waste.
__label__pos	A good idea.
__label__neu	i was looking for a stylish bag that suits the purpose.
__label__pos	It was the only toy that his weak and uncoordinated grasp could master and I particularly love the padded links because they were gentler on his gums.
__label__neu	This monitor has zero interference.
__label__pos	Alot of moms have reported that their babies no longer have latching problems etc after using this bottle.
__label__pos	I love this pack n' play.
__label__pos	But I tried it again with her at about 3 weeks and she loves it.
__label__pos	Favorite bottle for breasfteeding
__label__pos	It is utterly safe, sturdy, and reassuring to toddlers.
__label__pos	The little balls for rattling are kinda fun, too.
__label__neg	The Avent nipples are TOO HARD for a breastfed baby.
__label__pos	This is a baby that wants to constantly be held but he will happily play in his bouncer for 10 or so minutes at a time.
__label__neu	Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).
__label__pos	I'm told this is very sturdy for a swing, so I guess for a plastic one that can hold only 25 lbs.
__label__pos	the remote works great and what i love the most is that the box can be set to activate the music manually, or that the music can only be activated by the remote.
__label__pos	I definitely recommend this.
__label__neu	We prefered a basic blanket
__label__pos	a definate need for pregnancy
__label__neu	I wish I'd just gone straight to this one.I really agonized about whether to spend the money on this one or go with a cheaper one.
__label__neu	"I am able to carry him comfortably for as much as 2 hours and he weighs over 12 pounds (I'm only 5'2"".)"
__label__pos	I have had this from the day my daughter came home from the hospital and it has held up in the wash. No major accidents on it but the few there were are due to my not folding up the stinky diapers all the way or her spitting up.
__label__neu	The other tub he cried like life as we know it was ending.
__label__pos	I have been wanting to get this product for a while.
__label__pos	He loves to chew on them and suck on them (ew!).
__label__pos	I just add water whenever I add wipes  it's a no-brainer!
__label__pos	but WOW what awesome CS.
__label__neu	Also!
__label__pos	So much easier to find the exact food I am looking for.
__label__neg	"I was hesitant to buy too since the ""sheet"" is expensive and hardly a ""sheet"" at all."
__label__pos	It saves time and space (very compact and flat when folded up) and is holding up great.
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	It was great when my daughter would wake up for her middle-of-the-night feedings.
__label__neu	Water gets in, but you won't get it out.
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	This mirror works when I thought it wouldn't.
__label__neu	I bought numerous other brands of sippy cups, and most of them he can't manage to get any drink.
__label__neg	We also had to buy 4 of these toeven find one that wasn't broken when we took it out of the box.
__label__neu	I like it, my daughter hates it....
__label__neg	Has pockets and dividers... should work well!UPDATE - my zipper broke shortly after I had this and before it was 18mo old the clip broke.
__label__pos	We just had a new baby boy and I feel like a new mother!
__label__pos	I highly recommend this chair for both safety and enjoyment.
__label__neu	I switched to this bottle after failed attempts to use the Evenflo glass bottles.
__label__pos	In comparison, The stuffing on the Boppy my sister loaned us was pretty flat after she used it for only one child.You can even use it standing up or when you move around since the strap goes around your back.
__label__neg	I agree with other reviewers that it would be nice if it were slightly larger so it could be used longer.
__label__pos	my daughter loves the animals and it is really very stimulating in color design and motion.
__label__pos	It actually helps babies to breastfeed better.
__label__pos	good product for the most part
__label__neu	He's now 29 months and he doesn't mess with the toilets.
__label__neu	The weight of the child will dictate how fast it swings.
__label__pos	We can't express how much we LOVE the Dr. Brown's bottles.
__label__pos	Moms and dads you need this swing!!
__label__pos	..and durable!
__label__pos	They would finish a bottle in about 1/2 the time and no more caving in nipples or leaks.
__label__pos	I've been using bag #2 for two kids for a year now and it's great.
__label__neu	We hung these bugs on my daughter's car seat and swing when she was just two months old.
__label__neg	That is TOO expensive.
__label__pos	Easy to clean, dishwasher safe.
__label__neu	!
__label__neu	He can be entertained for 15-20 minutes if I need a moment to get dinner ready or anything.
__label__neg	Really wanted to like this tub but finally returned it
__label__pos	The service by target is very good.
__label__neu	Once they're a little bigger you can do away with the hammock and they get to submerge a little more in the water while still sitting up.
__label__pos	Plus having the baby within my arm's reach to soothe also added more hours to my sleep, which I desperately needed since I was the only one at home to take care of the baby (hubby had to go back to work after the first week).Adding the extensions does make the bed more shaky, but it's not going to collapse or tip over, especially when the cosleeper is right next to the adult bed.
__label__neg	not space efficient
__label__pos	I really wish we could have used this seat so hence the five stars.
__label__pos	I bought this for our 8 month old and she likes it a lot.
__label__pos	My baby would not sleep for more than 2 hours in a stretch, but the first night I used this, he slept for 4 hours straight.
__label__neg	But just so you know, a newborn can't sit very comfortably in it (give it a few weeks), and they will out-grow it by 5 or 6 months.
__label__neu	It's a lot faster and easier than trying to mess with the Genie.
__label__pos	this monitor does not make any distortion noises or anything of that sort.
__label__neu	*~
__label__pos	Cute toy.
__label__neg	In the first couple of weeks when he was 6-7 pounds, it wouldn't velcro small enough to be snug.
__label__neu	Patty Panda!
__label__pos	It is super convenient and easy to clean....think machine wash :-).
__label__neu	I got this because I knew eventually I'd have to warm bottles even though I am breastfeeding.
__label__pos	This seat is great!
__label__neg	However, the same brand, with the absorbent center pad, is much better.
__label__pos	I love that it turns off on its own, so I don't have to remember to do it.
__label__neu	My son would just pull these off the table.
__label__pos	Great functionality!
__label__pos	Great tub and worth every penny My son loves to take his baths in this since the sling makes him feel safe.
__label__neu	I got this for Christmas from my Mother-in-Law.
__label__neu	Snuggly Ride
__label__pos	The only one that is safe and works.
__label__neg	The mesh seat wicks the water all over, so she was sitting in a very wet chair.
__label__neu	It's great for the baby who loves to stand all the time and the parent who just can't hold her enough.The one problem that we had with the toy is that her hands would get stuck in the leg holes even when we were keeping our eyes on her.
__label__pos	Diaper Champ works well for me.
__label__neg	nice bottle warmer but not fast enough for my baby
__label__pos	My baby is 8 months (not sure why they labeled this 6 months...) and this is one of her favorite teethers.
__label__pos	We've had this mobile for about 2 weeks now...no battery changes needed and it is working just fine!
__label__neg	We threaded a towel between the cushion and seat support and let it drag on the floor for the first 4 months to slow it down.
__label__neg	This product is not recommended unless you don't mind it breaking every 12 months.I've owned two now that start off working pretty well.
__label__neg	Yes, I do realize it's not a walker but to take from one room to the next, wheels would be great.
__label__pos	It is generously sized but not overwhelmingly huge.It is made of a thin cotton, so isn't over hot to wear.
__label__neu	If this cost $[...] i may consider buying it.
__label__pos	I would definately recommend this!
__label__neu	I washed all my bottles with soap before putting them in the sterilizer just in case.Also, now that my daughter has moved on to sippy cups, I use the sterilizer to clean those annoying spill proof valves that are impossible to get clean and aren't supposed to go in the dishwasher.I did use it occaisionally for my breast pump parts as well and it worked great for them, I just didn't get to breast feed for very long :(It saves time, energy and water!
__label__neg	I ordered this seat but we are having to return it because it doesn't fit in the '02 Mercury Sable, or the '03 Sable.
__label__neu	We tried the other mobile at night, but he really couldn't see it--even with a night light.
__label__neg	That's my only complaint, but of course that meant we couldn't really use it.
__label__neu	It might just be my protruding belly and waning strength though....
__label__neu	My pantry was a mess before I got this.It was a little tricky at first to put it together (the instructions don't specify that you should twist the shelves to lock into place).
__label__neg	Anyhow the cheaper ones never really took off, the sleeves on the Carter's ones never fit him properly and were too warm, the bags were also not that big and constricted him so using them was always a battle.
__label__neu	Anyway my now nearly 6 month old loves grabbing things and after a night episode where he wrapped the blanket around his face twice the next day I was at babiesrus to check the Halo sleepsacks out.
__label__neg	We don't use it for sleep assistance currently.
__label__pos	My girl is 2.5 months old and large (15 pounds) but she fits in this thing perfectly just now.
__label__pos	Great!
__label__neg	:(
__label__pos	Thank you, Thank you....Inventor of this Chair!
__label__pos	Works great
__label__pos	Calming and Soothing!
__label__pos	It is much easier for those middle of the night diaper mishaps, to just go in and unsnap the top sheet and put baby back to bed.
__label__pos	This is a must purchase for your Bob as the cooler weather approaches.
__label__neu	I tried all the others.
__label__pos	The cover for the tray is nice since this booster was travelling with us, and it kept the actual tray clean for my son's finger foods.
__label__neg	Not to mention its bulkyness.We returned it and bought Nursery and Bath Care Set by Summer Infant Products.
__label__neu	I bought these bottles with the hopes that they'd reduce my baby's gas and fussiness.
__label__pos	So having the cosleeper at my level really helped me.
__label__pos	The attached cups are good too for rinsing the soap off or just letting your baby play and have some fun.
__label__pos	Once i tried these bottles, we were home free!
__label__pos	Wonderful bottle for breast or bottle fed babies.
__label__neg	I'll keep trying because this product seems like a great idea and it was not cheap, but perhaps it's just a little too much work for a newer baby.If this company or any other consumer, has any ideas on how to improve my situation with this sling,I would love to hear from them.
__label__neu	I seriously considered comments and reviews when deciding which items I wanted, which I could live without, and what was an absolute must have.
__label__neg	My only complaint is that the color is not really a sage green--it's a bit lighter and brighter, like a pale grass green.
__label__neg	On hot summer days, I can't use it because it will overheat the baby.
__label__neu	One day I filled it with scalding hot water (without my baby in it, of course) to see if it would change color and it didn't.
__label__pos	"My husband is 6'4 and big and he can make this work for him to take ""piggy"" out for a walk."
__label__pos	i love the colors, its a unisex bag, whicj i like , so i can use it with next baby.
__label__neg	This swaddler never fit our son so that it kept his arms in well enough to work.
__label__neu	All those cute receiving blankets are really useless for anything other than wiping up drool.
__label__neg	Health risk
__label__pos	I LOVE this as an unconventional bathtub!!
__label__pos	This cover started out as my favorite.
__label__pos	My son loves this bouncer.
__label__neg	It gets 4 stars because I think it takes way too long to heat up a bottle.
__label__pos	The best is that as a new born (before one can master the art of concealing breast feeding), you can use this to hold and feed your little one.
__label__pos	It is very easy to use once you get the hang of it.
__label__neu	Baby Trend will expect you to send the pail and the original receipt back to them for repairs if the filter comes out.
__label__pos	And the soft blue light and gently moving animals help distract baby long enough for him to forget that he doesn't want to go to sleep and drift off into dreamland.
__label__neg	)Also, the quality of the liners is pretty shabby... Expect the seams on the liners to be frayed, uneven, and single-stitched.
__label__pos	Ameda customer service was good when I had a problem.
__label__neu	She started at 3 weeks after i tried breast feeding.
__label__neg	Wish it came with a travel pouch/carry handle b/c I take it with me for overnight traveling
__label__pos	"I bought one for each of my two triplet boys.Pro: Color stays well, nice deeper pockets, not a ""just barely fits the mattress"" style.Con: A little loose."
__label__pos	There is also a line called Daisy Gear which offers a similar line of products as well as some as the same.. just to let anyone know.I LOVE THIS BACPACK!
__label__neu	!
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	The strap holes are a good enough size to fit just about any strap.
__label__neu	But better a little loose than so tight you have to stretch it on.
__label__pos	the pillow is so wonderful that i even have an extra large suitcase that i pack it in when traveling for work.
__label__pos	Whenever we go out to eat, we take this in.
__label__neu	Works well on contoured pad....
__label__neu	Of course not.
__label__neg	Now, that he is six months he doesn't really seem to like swinging at all.
__label__pos	This is a great booster:-The seat is padded and comfortable-It's very easy to clean and (so far) doesn't stain-The bottom doesn't scratch your chair-Straps to the chair and has an optional lap belt-The funky colors are kind of cool (I have the orange)Overall a really well designed seat: functional and stylish.
__label__pos	Add to this that I'm able to talk to her even though I'm somewhere else in house or yard -- just what I needed!Setup was quick and easy.
__label__pos	And the back support is a life saver since my 5 month old is already 18 lbs.So...take my advice.
__label__neu	Concerned about the chemicals in plastic bottles?
__label__neu	I name all of my DD's toys but I think this is this toy's actual name: Patty Panda.
__label__pos	Makes night-time crib linen changes easy and fast!
__label__pos	I can't say enough good things about this item.
__label__pos	Fantastic!
__label__pos	This bag is beautiful!
__label__neg	My son outgrew his small once, so I've ordered a larger one.
__label__pos	baby loves it!
__label__pos	We've been at a loss for someplace to rest her other than our arms during waking hours.
__label__neu	Purchased this item when I had my second child so that I could monitor them visually as well as audibly.
__label__pos	Our son loves his bed
__label__neu	We set it on his dresser.
__label__neu	I do hand wash so I think they last longer than if washed in a dishwasher.
__label__pos	I love my inclined to sleep.
__label__neu	Finally, after about 3 weeks of pain I decided to try this product.
__label__pos	Overall, I think it is a good product and would buy again.
__label__pos	This is a great little pump.
__label__neu	Whether you are using these diapers for diapering or for burp cloths, I suggest you look at the version with the padded absorbent center.
__label__neg	Oops!
__label__pos	No hot spots as microwaves produce and you can even warm baby food jars in this as well.Only a few times I had put too much water in and the bottle had to cool before I fed my son.It's so quick and is perfect for feedings that every mom should own one, even if you think you'll breastfeed exclusively.
__label__pos	Worked great!
__label__pos	It also has a feature for responding to your baby.
__label__pos	But to me it's well worth the money.
__label__pos	its very good quality!
__label__pos	The flight attendants were happy to carry the car seat to an airplane seat, and I put my son into a regular seat (strapped with a SEAT BELT) while I installed the car seat on the plane.Sure it seems expensive for something so small, but it works!
__label__neu	!
__label__neu	So in the warmer months, I had to dress him in only a diaper shirt to prevent him from sweating.
__label__pos	It is definitely the best swing on the market with all of its bells and whistles, stability, versatility, and even looks.
__label__pos	Save yourself aggravation and make sure everything that goes down is bundled up neatly.
__label__pos	Any time we have a sitter we make sure they use this as well.It is SO easy and SO great to use.
__label__pos	I like the angle of the bottle.
__label__pos	She can't reach the ground yet but she sits in here for a long time and manipulates the toys.
__label__neg	I went back to the Vent Aire bottle I started out with.
__label__pos	My son really enjoyed it.
__label__pos	I've always been scared to use a thermometer rectally but I wasn't nervous with this one at all.
__label__neu	As the caregiver for an elder who's recovering from stroke, I need to monitor her condition constantly -- a difficult task when you're also taking care of additional household responsibilities.
__label__neu	finger brushes just dont cut it for me in teeth cleaning so i just gave that one for my daughter to chew on since its rubbery and she did enjoy chewing it, but i didn't really use it to clean her teeth.
__label__pos	That makes bath time so much easier.
__label__neg	Would be even better if it had wheels.
__label__neu	If you like sturdy, high thread count and a thick uniform cloth, get the Gerber premium prefolds.
__label__pos	Great bottle for breastfeeding, supplementing or formula fed babies
__label__pos	Perfect when they're newborn.
__label__pos	But once I figured it out, it works fine.This item works for jars only, by the way.
__label__pos	The rails come off easily for cleaning, and the stool can be moved easily just by squeezing the two rails together and picking it up.
__label__pos	Very stylish and seems to be very sturdy.
__label__pos	Great Mobile
__label__neu	I had been putting off getting a swing because they are expensive and I felt my girl would outgrow it very quickly but I was not getting anything done trying to keep her occupied and I cracked, ran out and bought this.
__label__neg	This rack didn't work with any of them!
__label__pos	It doesn't have video, but it has all the rest.
__label__neu	You'll need a cross-head screwdriver for the battery compartment.
__label__pos	I found the pumping mechanism very comfortable even when my nipples were very sore from initial breastfeeding.
__label__pos	Fits gerber bottles too.
__label__pos	I got these for my son when he was 4 months old and it was instantly his favorite toy.
__label__neu	Explore the outdoors......
__label__pos	"No 2am ""I'm cold"" crying, plus we don't have to worry about it ending up over his face."
__label__pos	Makes sheet changing so easy!
__label__neu	We purchased this and the wind/rain screen.
__label__pos	Whenever he gets fussy we can switch on the vibrating motion and it calms him for a while longer - at least until we can finish this review!It's one of our best baby purchases and we look forward to using it when he's a toddler.M...
__label__neu	She hasn't outgrown it yet, and has plenty of room.
__label__pos	"I was initially concerned about previous reviews that these sheets would be ""too thin"" but I also purchased a quilted mattress pad/protector and they are great together."
__label__neg	The entire back of Jacques' plumage consists of a variety of black and white patterns, which my son loved to stare at.He is now 7 months, and doesn't play with it as much as he used to since he is more into musical and talking toys, the jumperoo, and is busy crawling and cruising...but Jacques continues to never be too far from my son's reach.
__label__pos	Also fits on the Prince Lionheart diaper depot.
__label__pos	After looking at several different variations my husband and I decided to go with this one.
__label__pos	I wish I had used this after the birth of my first child, too, because I had the same issue with cracked nipples, but struggled with it much longer since I didn't know about this product.
__label__neu	I tried the cosleeper without it for a week and it was breaking my back to dip down to pick up the baby to breastfeed at night.Giving birth naturally injured my back/hip.
__label__pos	She sits and stares at the world from the seat and it always puts her to sleep.
__label__pos	They can be easily tossed into the washing machine, which is a must for any toy used by a teething baby.He also digs the crate they came in.
__label__pos	Now that he is older, he is really enjoying watching the leaves and birds rotate and watching himself in the relective mirror above.
__label__neg	But she just got fussier and fussier because she was spitting up everything at each feeding.
__label__pos	If I had to return all my gifts and keep one, this is the one I would keep.
__label__pos	We bought the dekor plus at babies r us.
__label__neg	After about 8 months, things start to no longer function:- Adjusting the volume button results in speak not working.
__label__neg	...in medical bills!
__label__pos	I nursed my twins for about 4 1/2 months, so I thought the Avent would be the best.
__label__pos	it startled her every time when she was about to fall asleep, so i took a rubberband and fixed it around the shapes so they wouldn't slide anymore.
__label__pos	Anyway I love this darling little girl.
__label__pos	It folds easily if you decide you don't want it out for some reason and it has an interior bag which doesn't collapse from the weight of a hefty bundle of clothing.
__label__neu	This system works great but is so bulky on my newborn.
__label__pos	It is really funny.
__label__neu	The pictures of this set on Amazon and kidsline do not do the set justice.
__label__pos	It is holding up so far in the wash, so the quality seems good.
__label__pos	Love Orbit
__label__neg	could not even try it it didn't fit on our crib.
__label__pos	I would tell others to get this booster, over others that are not as nice or entertaining, overall a great value, worth every penny.
__label__pos	This is a fabulously built seat though, but we're going to have to buy the Diplomat or Roundabout instead.
__label__pos	We had other, more conventional monitors, but as my son co-sleeps with us, we wanted to be able to keep an eye on him if we couldn't be in the room with him, as he falls asleep before us.
__label__pos	so they can be used on a regular basis even after your child is no longer interested in playing with them.
__label__pos	Soft & durable
__label__pos	A favorite of my boys
__label__pos	Much more freedom than being strapped in a stroller or on someone's back.
__label__neg	If you have a Babies R US near you, I recommend checking out the sets in person.
__label__pos	Even though it's not THE GREATEST, it works great for being under $20.
__label__pos	Now she uses the regular bath part and loves it.
__label__pos	I just got this today and I love it so far.
__label__pos	This set is the most complete one on the market and there will be no need to supplement it with anything else.
__label__pos	My 4.5 month-old daughter LOVES her exersaucer!
__label__pos	So far we are very satisfied customers and my husband can walk straight through the opening so the width meets our needs better than I anticipated.
__label__pos	I carry this matt (rolled up) in the basket of our stroller when we go out in case we eat out, and always make sure to take it when we visit friends and family.
__label__neg	"I just think the design on the ""dangly parts"" could be better."
__label__neu	As a new mom it is hard enough learning to hold a new baby let alone bathe her.
__label__pos	We recently took the system on a train ride and the carry bag that is included was great to have to tote the seat around in, the only negative is that the bag is a little tight to close.The only negative is that it is a little akward to fold, but that is very minor.Also, ours did not come with the 'Orbit' logo on the stroller bar.
__label__pos	Great gate for younger children/pets.
__label__pos	BY FAR THE BEST BABY ITEM!!!
__label__pos	Pleased with width of opening
__label__pos	We have this monitor and I could not live without it.
__label__pos	We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.
__label__neg	The only down fall of this monitor is that the lights do light up my room quite a bit, since we use a noise machine in the kids rooms.
__label__neg	I bought this one in pink-lavender stripes and found that it's impossible to use it correctly and very uncomfortable for the child in it (the whole body and especially the neck).
__label__pos	Its very adaptable with three different speeds (for different ages/stages), upright and laid back seating positions as well as three way turning.
__label__neg	does not fit on convertable cribs
__label__pos	This tub can go from birth to 2 yrs old.
__label__pos	just what i wanted
__label__neg	PLus,I felt like it was a big production to set the bath up at night.
__label__neg	lol I could see the suction was working, but not particularly strong & it didn't do a thing.I read the other reviews & I guess it depends on the person as some people obviously have no problems & others can't get the darn thing to work at all.
__label__pos	I am thoroughly pleased with this kit.
__label__neg	THe color feature isn't that great, but that isn't a big deal for me.
__label__neg	I will definitely purchase the next size.I have read the other review that mentioned the swaddler wrap getting bunched up around the neck and face.
__label__neg	I am having the hardest time installing the darned things.
__label__pos	An item I'm glad we bought
__label__pos	We got the dekor plus after using the small dekor for 10 months.
__label__pos	She's been sleeping sweetly now for over an hour and went to sleep the instant she was placed in this device.
__label__neu	My older son is now 14 years old and boy have baby products changed since then!
__label__pos	Child safety lock.
__label__neu	I can't believe there is so much controversy about bottle warmers and wipe warmers!
__label__neg	I can't see over it and doesn't squeeze into the backseat very well.
__label__neg	You twist the inside ring and ONLY cut when the Genie is full.
__label__pos	They even have variable flow nipples so you don't have to buy three sets.
__label__neg	I plan on calling the company for some tips in the morning.
__label__neg	We wanted pressure mounted gates but I was concerned that the opening of this particular gate would not be wide enough for my husband.
__label__pos	Baby (4 months) is not gassy at all.
__label__neg	I read about these when I was pregnant and thought, man, those are some overpriced blankets!
__label__neg	Does NOT stay up on all kinds of tile
__label__neg	All of a sudden, her hands were no longer playing with the toys or up in the air and we would peek under the jumparoo and see them dangling out the leg holes.
__label__pos	It is very easy to put on him (unlike some other over the head/arm cheaper harnesses) and is very soft and comfortable.
__label__pos	We had a little bit of trouble putting it together but in the end I feel like it is very sturdy and I am very pleased with the way it looks.
__label__pos	This swing has helped me get through a lot.
__label__pos	This never happened when we used it and I can't imagine how it happened to them.
__label__pos	The thermos keeps the same temperature for several hours (or I make the water really hot if I think that I won't be using it until later in the day).
__label__pos	It's comfortable and offers plenty of storage space.
__label__pos	there is no sleeping without it!
__label__pos	Although I know I wouldn't buy the Ocean Wonders Aquarium again, I would buy this one again.
__label__pos	I highly recommend this for young kids
__label__pos	He does get very warm in it, so I only use it for short periods of time when it is hot.
__label__pos	Once I got the hang of it, I found this pump to be lifechanging.
__label__pos	Beautiful Pack N Play, lots of features
__label__pos	This is really good for women who are used to sleeping on their back normally but have to start sleeping on their sides as they progress into their pregnancy(like myself).This pillow helps a great deal.
__label__pos	Bottom line: There is no perfect baby carrier for all ages and stages of development  but I think the Ergo is the best carrier out there for older babies.
__label__neg	I thought it was just a fluke, so I bought a second one and it does the same thing.
__label__pos	the best!
__label__neg	The new spouts are NOT like the old spouts, I just bought new cups and they don't let enough air into the cup, so the nipple inverts into the cup when the child is sucking liquid from it.
__label__neu	I cant imagine not being able to see my daughter at night if I hear her making noise.
__label__pos	It takes most of the weight off your back and it's very easy to take on and off.
__label__pos	Our babies first few months would have been MUCH more stressful without it.
__label__pos	I love the fact that the music isn't annoying.
__label__pos	my daughter is small, so it was pretty necessary for her comfort in the highchairs in restaurants and the grocery carts.
__label__pos	The thermometer is also a great addition if your child's bathtub doesn't already have one.
__label__pos	This solved my problems.
__label__pos	Flimsy arm rests
__label__pos	i can get about 4 diapers, towel, wipes, 2 change of clothes, baby cream.
__label__pos	Very Pleased!!
__label__neg	Used this once and gave it away
__label__neg	"He cried and hung on the side the whole time until I ""freed"" him."
__label__neu	"They might like the doorway jumpers for a little longer since they can actually ""go"" somewhere, but then I was concerned about safety with a doorway jumper."
__label__neg	Fisher Price could stand to make the metal bar thicker.
__label__pos	Great for diaper storage and such.
__label__pos	NOW THAT IS A BIG PLUS!!
__label__pos	This one definitely keeps them tightly wrapped no matter what.
__label__neg	The unit is supposed to snap on top of the organizer, but mine kept sliding off.
__label__pos	My 6 month old loves his cars!
__label__neg	I love the idea of this sling and it is sturdy and attractive, but my 10 week old son just cannot get comfortable in it.
__label__pos	I was thrilled to find that Amazon had these glass ones in stock.
__label__pos	Great bouncy seat!!
__label__pos	The only baby blanket I use.
__label__pos	Definitely worth the money.
__label__pos	I bought this because of the wipe warmer, but it is terrible.
__label__pos	I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road.
__label__pos	This is definitely worth the money.
__label__pos	One very cool feature is that all that extra stuff turns off by itself in about 10 minutes.
__label__pos	I imagine this toy will remain one of my son's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor.
__label__pos	I had originally chosen another bedding set because it looked so cute on-line.
__label__pos	Adorable Swing
__label__pos	The bear is quite cute and the white provides a nice contrast for easy eye focus  my little one will track it with his eyes whenever I hold it in front of him.The head crinkles quite nicely.
__label__neg	We returned it and found that just hanging little animals on the bar are better than swinging a heavy mobile an inch or two from her face!
__label__pos	I don't see how anyone lives without a bouncy seat.
__label__neg	I am returning this today to try a different brand!
__label__neg	The music is great quality, although i wish it had an even lower volume setting.
__label__neu	My last experience with baby swings was in the 1980's when they could hold the weight of a small adult.
__label__pos	My baby has loved this since she was about six months old.
__label__neu	It is an eye sore in the living room.
__label__pos	I am very pleased with it.
__label__neu	I would have given this item 5 stars was it not for how long it took to put the item together.
__label__neu	Before I became a mom, I thought I needed a huge bag but it turns out, I don't (not sure why).
__label__pos	I love this item.
__label__pos	It's great because she can hold onto it easily and the rattle inside intrigues her, she's always trying to get at it.
__label__neg	I could get cheaper ones at target and Carter's Baby and to me that was good enough.
__label__neg	Shabby-Chic...
__label__pos	This monitor has freed up our lives, and we will never part with it.
__label__pos	And I love the ceiling display.
__label__pos	They need to improve this tub.
__label__pos	~*DARN GOOD PRODUCT!
__label__neu	Just a tip!!
__label__neg	Not worth the money.
__label__pos	It is also a nice discreet bag to travel with.
__label__pos	A great toy all around!
__label__neu	My son screams waiting for the warmer to get done.
__label__pos	I got my money back on this Swaddlebees and bought two more covers (a thirsties and a prowrap) for two bucks more, and Nicki's offers free shipping on all covers.
__label__pos	A must buy!
__label__neu	I have researched every gate on the market at this point.
__label__pos	I've used it in a shopping cart and on a restaurant highchair and both went on with easy.
__label__pos	We are thinking about buying the ladybug now.
__label__neg	My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag.
__label__neg	It's very soft and fuzzy, and you can pick four different soothing sounds.
__label__neg	Babies often can't wait that long.
__label__pos	I charged the parent monitor overnight, installed lithium batteries in the baby monitor, and I was ready to go.
__label__neu	Me too!
__label__pos	The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto.
__label__pos	"BUY THIS AND DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON OTHER CARRIERS"
__label__neg	These bottles look so nice and are so durable BUT they only offer one kind of nipple and are not compatible with any other system, so if you child doesn't like thier nipple, you're heavily invested in a huge set that is useless.
__label__pos	Cute, durable and used teething toy.
__label__pos	The strap also provides back & lumbar support.
__label__neu	I did better with the plastic ones that stick.
__label__pos	My daughter who is now 8 weeks loves her swing.
__label__neu	sexy, huh?
__label__neu	Although quilts are not recommended in cribs, I throw mine over a rocker and it is a really nice addition to the baby's room.The item I did not use is the valance.
__label__pos	It is incredibly soft and the pink with polka dots matches our room perfectly.
__label__pos	It is a nice warmer though and I would recommend it to others just as long as their baby is patient enough to wait the minute or mintue and a half that it takes to warm up the bottle.
__label__neg	I didn't think I was particularly rough on the bag.
__label__pos	The backpack is cleverly designed to fit the motor and the collection kit in a compact manner.
__label__pos	When she is really cranky and we just can't walk with her anymore, we can put it in her and bounce her with our hands or feet to make her happy.
__label__pos	It is safe and at the same time glides both on carpet and vinyl floor.
__label__pos	Best Booster seat ever!
__label__pos	Instead of bending over, trying to hold them with the crook of your arm, plop them in the hammock and they get to relax and enjoy the warm water.
__label__pos	I used this product a lot when breastfeeding in public.
__label__neu	(So if you have a baby who fusses at it, avoid it for a few days and try it again for brief periods to get the baby used to it.)
__label__neg	I personally found it a little busy and there was only one, when I have 2 windows in my baby's room.
__label__pos	Excellent!
__label__neu	Our baby was able to bust out of a swaddle early on, even with the special velcro-ing (is that a verb?)
__label__pos	It is very durable and washes well, which comes in handy for spit up and diaper leaks.
__label__pos	I give this a 5 start plus.My 6 month old Grandbaby was put in this playpen yesterday for his first time.
__label__pos	Great product.
__label__pos	There was one missing part to the drawer but I emailed customer service about it and had the part shipped to me within a week so I was also very satisfied with the customer service aspect.
__label__pos	Loved it!
__label__neu	!
__label__neu	You can't help but get milk on it sometimes...or spit up.
__label__pos	Our baby (nearly 4months old) loves this seat as a place to hang out with parents as they do, well, whatever parents do.
__label__pos	The whales were a little disturbing and not my daughter's favorite, but the other three are great.
__label__neu	Superman had Kryptonite and my baby has swings.
__label__pos	LOVE
__label__pos	It seems to be very accurate, and gives a reading in seconds.
__label__pos	The only bad things is that it moves a little too easily when I put the car seat in the car, and I have to constantly adjust it when I get in the car to make sure I can see my son from the front seat.
__label__pos	All the extra compartments make this into a diaper bag if needed.
__label__neu	The silicone is the wrong texture too - nothing like the real thing.If you really like the look of Avent and think you want to use them, buy just one bottle and nipple to start until you are sure they work.In my opinion, a much better starter system is the Playtex (I use the Drop-Ins) - it comes with several different nipple shapes to try, including latex, which has a more realistic texture.I foolishly bought the Avent starter set because someone somewhere told me that they were the most breastfeeder friendly and that companies that make bottles AND formula only want to sabatoge your brreastfeeding efforts - - what a silly and paranoid accusation that turned out to be!
__label__pos	At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth.
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	The bumps really feel good on her gums.
__label__neu	The bottom of the chair sits an inch or two above the sink or tub- so in order to have the baby in any water, you need to fill up the sink quite a bit.
__label__pos	It is a terry like covering that fits perfectly over the top of Baby Bjorn.
__label__pos	My husband and I decided that we got more use out of this item than with any other thing we bought for our baby -- it was DEFINITELY money well spent!
__label__pos	This product is a must have for late fall/winter babies.
__label__pos	He's in it as we write this.
__label__pos	it grows with your baby
__label__neg	The insulating side compartment suddenly ripped so the foil was just peeling off.
__label__pos	Good Diaper Pail
__label__pos	I love this!
__label__pos	Soft and cozy
__label__neu	Do reduce burping but is it necessary?
__label__pos	Now I don't have to worry about warming my breastmilk for the babysitter or my husband to give my little one.
__label__pos	It is comfortable, cozy, warm, and easier to use than a snowsuit/coat.
__label__pos	If baby's diaper leaks it only gets on this sheet.
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	Great Potty Chair
__label__pos	THIS IS NOT A LOUD, ANNOYING TOY.THIS IS A PERFECT SIZE AND WAIT AND DESIGN TOY FOR BABIES AROUND NINE MONTHS AND UP.
__label__pos	I know the swing is only meant for occasional use but every couple of hours for a week did it no damage.
__label__pos	No problems with this monitor!
__label__pos	The feature that I loved the most was the baby hammock.
__label__pos	Great Animal Bedding
__label__neg	The hot sensor is silly though, we peeled it off.
__label__pos	This bottle was great for switching back and forth from breast, since I was unable to feed from the left nipple for quite a while.
__label__pos	I took it everywhere with us, and it kept him entertained.
__label__neu	If I'm going to be out, not using wipes at home all day, I unplug the warmer--according to the directions.
__label__neu	!
__label__neu	My husband thinks that Sophie is too girly of a name for a boy toy so he insists that we call him Jerry.
__label__neu	I must have hefted my pregnant self and my 10 month old over that gate a hundred times a day and it was taking a serious toll on my back and knees.
__label__pos	It works great.
__label__pos	What a lifesaver!!
__label__pos	Didn't work with any of the bottles we used
__label__pos	Great, Comfy Bouncer
__label__pos	This is almost a necessity when you purchase the Superyard XT.HINT: Do NOT buy two extensions, as the superyard becomes unstable with more than one set added (per manufacturers specifications).
__label__pos	MY 15 MONTHS AGE DAUGHTER PLAYS WITH IT.
__label__neg	The reason we changed it is because the inner lid stopped functioning properly.
__label__neu	I bought this gate yesterday.
__label__neg	Good seat but not for infants
__label__neg	BASKET IS HARD TO GET TO & ITEM IS HARD TO UNFOLD SOMETIMES
__label__neu	I was sent both this one and the microwave sterilizer.I just had a baby boy 2 weeks back so one can imagine my excitement and nervousness.I used the microwave sterilizer from avent again for 1 week and it was awesome.Extremely convenient and easy.ITs been a week now that i have received the iQ24 and I have been blown away by the features.This one too sterilizes in no time and 6 minutes in mode 1 with 90 ml of water and keeps everything sterile for 7-8 hoursMode 2 does the same with 200 ml of water keeping everything sterile for 24 hours.I love the easy operation and the fact that it holds much more than the microwave sterilizer.the only thing i didnt like is the fact that everything remains wet ..ofcourse its steam and it condenses..So far , I love it.
__label__neu	Rinse, wash, repeat).
__label__neu	It does work and is a good size, but it is so cold, utilitarian, and almost ugly in it's bare functionality.
__label__pos	We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it!
__label__pos	Gotta Get 2!
__label__pos	It takes AA that only with last 4 hours.
__label__pos	They were great before.
__label__pos	This mattress pad is waterproof.
__label__pos	love it
__label__pos	Very convenient.
__label__pos	Plus, unlike a bottle warmer appliance, there are no moving part or electrical components to wear out or break, so we expect we'll be using ours for years/babies to come.
__label__pos	Ash used the reclining part until she was about 6 months old and able to sit pretty well straight up.
__label__pos	I love this thing
__label__pos	I also have two at Grandma's for changing and laying on the bed.
__label__pos	I had originally registered for another tub bit it was a major dissapointment.
__label__pos	The classic organic toy crinkle bear is beginning to become a hit in my house.
__label__pos	since then, it works like a charm.
__label__pos	Glad I Got This One
__label__pos	There are many other accessories such as throw pillows, lamp, wall border, wall hanging, mobile, extra crib sheet, etc - that can be purchased separately.
__label__neg	She's not a big fan of her car seat, and despite being now 10 lbs and 24 inches, she's still a bit small to enjoy her Fisher Price vibrating chair/rocker--it reclines too much, and is a bit wide, so she slumps.
__label__neg	But by then they want to move-on to something they can sit-up in anyway.
__label__neg	I tried emailing Columbia about it but they never wrote back.
__label__neg	I changed the batteries for the second time and they ran out after ONE use!
__label__pos	Later it can be used as a step stool as they grow.
__label__pos	No odors have escaped the pail in 3 months.
__label__neg	The bottle brush is an inconsequential addition.
__label__neu	Dont know.
__label__neg	I was originally happy with my diaper bag purchase until after she was two months old.
__label__pos	Very pleased!
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	I ended up having to use it sooner than I thought, and was so glad I had it on hand.A few times I was not able to produce enough milk so had to supplement with a few formula feedings.
__label__neg	My son doesn't really like them anymore because it is too hard for him.
__label__pos	The neck loop is fastened by D-rings, allowing you to adjust it easily with just one hand.
__label__pos	I find it very useful when I have to take milk or liquid with me that I don't need right away.
__label__pos	I love the different sounds it makes and my baby loves watching the fish.
__label__neu	baby monitor
__label__pos	It is so clear I can hear my husband talking from a few rooms away.
__label__pos	My daughter had a hard time falling asleep almost anywhere but in her swing, she LOVES it!
__label__pos	Also, I love all the side pockets!
__label__pos	Originally, I had purchased a boppy covered in cotton patterned fabric.
__label__pos	The bag is also large enough for him to kick, lift his legs and move freely.
__label__pos	Since she was born in the winter, I gave her a bath in the bathroom so that I could get it really warm.
__label__pos	"In case anyone else is in that position, here are my two cents:GET THIS PUMP (OR ANOTHER HIGH-END ONE) IF...- You're going back to work- Your milk supply is medium to low- You plan to pump more than two or three times per month- You are opposed to giving your baby any formula, ever (with this pump you could build up ""reserve"" breastmilk in case of an emergency)TRY A CHEAPER ONE IF...- You have a very abundant milk supply- You only plan to pump one or twice a month- You wouldn't mind giving your baby formula if you had to be away from her for an extended period"
__label__neu	If you can get both, do it.
__label__pos	It's SO MUCH EASIER than using the restaurant booster.
__label__pos	Sturdy, tall, nice to look at and it opens effortlessly.
__label__pos	This bag has lots of pockets, is well-made and is stylish so I know many moms would love this.
__label__pos	Distributes the weight well- easy to carry!
__label__pos	The only real drawbacks are that it doesn't have any way to secure it to the changing table without the diaper depot... and it is a bit bulky.
__label__pos	"It was easy to assemble.When it arrived our son ""helped"" with assembling and transitioned from crib to bed without any tears."
__label__neg	I contacted my seller but never got any response as to why the logo was left off.
__label__neu	My son is a super busy-body.
__label__neu	blankets like the Kiddopotamus & Co. Organic Cotton SwaddleMe - Ivory.
__label__neu	I've unfortunatly had to use this recently for the 1st time.
__label__neg	The other thing that I don't like is that you can't see them in the dark, but I don't know if thats possible with any mirror.
__label__pos	Simple mobile, big smiles
__label__neu	Be aware.
__label__pos	This mirror is easy to install but it does throw you off b/c the straps are backwards but if you twist one then it works great.
__label__neu	Trust me, the bigger the better.
__label__pos	This toy is on the expensive side but I have to say that it is really worth it!
__label__pos	The diaper wipes dispenser was broken so I called the company, they shipped a new one out immediately!When my daughter gets older and less demanding (diaper bag wise) I intend on buying the Daisy Gear tote.This bag really has everything you'll need.
__label__pos	My son was a couple of weeks old and I was in LOVE with this cover.
__label__pos	The only drawback is that they're relatively expensive, but I guess that's the cost of convenience.
__label__pos	"I like that the pump itself is very small and you can put it in any bag, though this bag is nice and doesn't scream ""BREASTPUMP!!!"""
__label__pos	(altho her other rattles are certainly more effective, she does like to stop chewing and shake it, which is better than dropping it like she does with other teethers)The plastic case is a nice touch, too, keeps it clean if it falls into the dark depths of the diaper bag.
__label__pos	I actually like these bottles and we use these for formula and avent for breastmilk, just out of habit.
__label__neu	There is no need for boiling water or anything like that.
__label__pos	:) It never seemed to bother her, but we decided to stuff one of her blankets or a towel in front of her to fill the gap in the seat area so that her hands couldn't fall through anymore.I have a picture posted to illustrate what I am talking about.Despite this issue, I would buy this toy again without a second thought.
__label__pos	I love that there are slow flow, medium, fast and then sippy tops.
__label__pos	I keep the parent monitor with me at all times, and I'm able to hear the smallest sounds from my elder's room.
__label__pos	This mobile is calming & soothing.
__label__pos	I was very pleased at the comfort in the seat padding and the fact the seatbelts rarely twist.
__label__pos	I'll positively be back.
__label__neg	When we used those little floating rubber ducks that have the word HOT on the bottom that turn white when the water is too hot, the plug didn't turn white.
__label__neu	We thought about bringing the bumbo but didn't want to have to put him on the floor to feed.My son was 4 months, had been sitting up for a bit and enjoyed sitting and eating mushy foods.PROS: Very easy to clean.
__label__pos	It's lightweight, so carrying my sleeping infant in it to or from the car is easy.
__label__neg	My only complaint is that there is not a lot of padding on the seat and it felt really uncomfortable.
__label__pos	And, I didn't mind wearing it.
__label__pos	The velour fabric incredibly soft for my newborn (unlike the stiff cotton of the other one).
__label__pos	Wonderful!
__label__pos	THE BEST BOUNCER!
__label__pos	"I was against getting a lot of baby gear with lights and music and didn't register for it, but someone gave this to me, describing it as ""crack for babies."""
__label__neg	Do not waste your money!
__label__pos	I think that is a good recommendation - we ended up buying a better stroller (Uppababy Vista) to replace the graco quattro that came with the travel system.
__label__pos	The music is enjoyable (not tinny sounding like other toys) and there are so many different sounds and sound bits that I can't keep track.
__label__pos	These pads have definitely come in handy.
__label__pos	I use it with a large infant tub and my baby is supported wonderfully.
__label__pos	I have trouble squeezing these to make the water squirt out - no way can my kids do them!
__label__neg	I have noticed that if I move the camera to certain areas of the crib the reception will suffer so you have to get the camera in just the right spot.
__label__neg	I do have one word of caution: Make sure there are absolutley no diaper tape edges hanging loose when you flip the cylinder.
__label__pos	It's dark brown (not black) w/ the pink flowers.It comes with attachment staps so you can hang it on a stroller.
__label__pos	We have never had leakage problems.
__label__neu	I use tall kitchen trash bags.
__label__pos	My child loves this teether!
__label__neg	Also the on/off switch is impossible to use.
__label__pos	PERFECT HANDLES FOR LITTLE ONE TO HOLD THEM IN THEIR HANDS.I think it is also shown in BABY BACH....DVD by Baby Einstein.
__label__neu	The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are.
__label__pos	It makes it so easy to bathe my toddler and my infant at the same time in the tub!!
__label__neu	We decided we had to have something so we started researching.
__label__neu	Still waiting for baby to come...
__label__pos	Otherwise, product is great.
__label__pos	)My wife tried a boppy for the first month then got this, which she used continually for the next year.
__label__neu	My second daughter only liked these, if it wasn't mommy (if ya know what I mean).
__label__neu	We started with the Diaper Genie as most new parents do.
__label__pos	We use this mat everyday outside and it still looks great.
__label__pos	The only thing is that it fit my bassinet pad just a little loose, other than that this is a great product.
__label__pos	Unlike another reviewer, I like that fact that it doesn't prepare a large portion.
__label__neg	After four months I started having problems with my milk supply.
__label__pos	Great for the post-swaddling months
__label__pos	I'm so happy I took a chance on this product!
__label__pos	My 2 month old loves to look at lights, although these lights are quite bright for a small toy.
__label__pos	Still a great monitor.
__label__pos	It has great suction power and adjustable suction speeds, which makes all the difference.
__label__neu	I have inexpensive mattresses so this may fit snugger on a big thick mattress that you have to pay more for.
__label__neg	The bags never fit right and then it never spun right.
__label__neu	absorbant but bulky
__label__pos	So nice, even sleeping in it is easy.
__label__pos	Plenty of room to hold all of the baby's bath stuff and great to use to sit on while giving the little one a bath.
__label__pos	Worth every dime.
__label__pos	At nine months, she seems to have exhausted all of the activities provided, but it is a great place to put her when I jump into the shower because I know she is happy and safe!
__label__neu	It did not always stay on my nipple very well, but I may not have been putting it on correctly, I now realize.
__label__pos	Our son loved to cuddle down inside and fall asleep, and I never had to worry about the cold air getting to him.
__label__pos	Great Sterelizer!!!
__label__neu	to the grandparents' house.
__label__pos	I like them
__label__pos	And what's so special about this one is the wonderful fish-patterned seat (my son almost goes cross-eyed trying to look at it while he's on it) & the captivating activity bar.
__label__neg	Niether of my boys liked these bottles/nipples.
__label__pos	If you have two people you're much better off.
__label__neu	We don't look for constellations we just like the stars.
__label__pos	I loved the Ashley Floral pattern...not only cute and girly but practical for the hot summers here in Texas.
__label__pos	I got lots of use out of it when she was a newborn for swaddling and have brought it out again now that she has started rolling over and kicking her blankets off.
__label__pos	"You can't ""fill it"" with water, but it does hold water as you clean the baby, and it's very light and water repellent (so you just lift it and pour the water out when you're done), and small enough to fit on the counter next to the sink."
__label__pos	It's comfy and it works great for infants with reflux.
__label__neu	The colors of the actual articles are much more vibrant than shown in the pictures.
__label__pos	Love this tub!
__label__pos	I would have purchased this chair first if I had seen it.
__label__pos	It is quick, easy to use, and fits other brands as well.
__label__pos	"BUT: while it is not rocket science to put it on, it takes some ""experience"" to do it one handed, with the baby in the other...I sure would recommend it at least until the new mom figures out how to nurse the ""relaxed"" way, with the baby in your lap."
__label__pos	I purchased this when my baby was one month old and wished I had it sooner.
__label__pos	I would rather throw the diapers on our kitchen trash can.
__label__neu	I have one on my changing table that came with my Pack n Play.
__label__pos	I know I thought I would, but not everything works out as you plan.
__label__neu	So I took the cover off and put a knitted baby blanket in under the cover for extra padding.
__label__pos	A BIG must have for moms!
__label__pos	With all the different levels in our house, I was concerned that it may not function in some areas, however so far, I have had no problems.
__label__pos	I don't know what we would've done without it.
__label__pos	"I am glad to have this ""luxury"" for my baby."
__label__pos	Being a first time mom I didn't realize that you have to wait when they are newwborns to put it in swing motion (I wondered why it went so fast) as they are too light still and it goes pretty fast.
__label__pos	This Pack N Play has so many cool things, Vibration, Music and lights, mobile, shade, Changing Table, bassinet.
__label__pos	I also like how it has a built in bath caddy to put baby's shampoo/soap/toys/washcloths whatever.
__label__pos	Overall I love this mobile.
__label__pos	you have to use your index finger to press it and its actually hard to do so.
__label__pos	I love it!
__label__neg	It just made noise.
__label__pos	Another bonus is there is less clean up.
__label__pos	The nail clippers and tweezers have a magnifying glass on them which makes it much easier for clipping babies nails.
__label__pos	She loves the bright colors and they've kept her entertained for three months now.
__label__neu	I had been using a manual before I bought this.
__label__neu	IT IS ALSO IN MANY DAYCARES/ PRESCHOOLS.
__label__neu	being a former stomach sleeper, as i began to grow in my pregnancy i had to find something to help me sleep.
__label__neu	Also, my son had no problems with colic.
__label__pos	love it!
__label__pos	Great choice!
__label__pos	It is a nice size and the versatility of the product is great.
__label__pos	No more forgetting to replace the cover when I'm done!
__label__neu	After about the 10th time I nearly fell over the darn thing, I went to find a new gate and saw this one.
__label__pos	I loved the fact (and still do) that it has a spray.
__label__neu	When my daughter was a baby (she is 5 now) I used the 4-in-1 from the first years, it worked alright until it broke (over zellest dad) Then we tried the 4-in-1 from safety first, my daughter who was average size leaned forward to get a toy and fell in to the waterface first with her legs stuck under the ring.
__label__pos	BUY IT!
__label__pos	My baby fits so comfy in this chair and I know she is going to use it for a long time.
__label__pos	In my opinion the cadillac of all swings.
__label__neu	Right now, it sits right at tray level so you either have to squish it or make it stick out above the tray.
__label__pos	Like so many other reviewers...my husband and I are SO thankful for this thing!
__label__neu	It funny because now she talks to her feet.
__label__pos	It easy clips and velcro's so you can adjust it in any car.
__label__pos	i like the khaki just in case of any stains/spills/spit up it camoflauges wonderfully!
__label__neu	Email me at: Jul262003@yahoo.com
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	Grumpy Babies: Resistance is futile!
__label__pos	Convenient with several uses
__label__pos	It is by far the toy he plays with the most!
__label__pos	The fabric quality is excellent and I like the fact that I could secure it behind my neck very easily so it wouldn't fall and I could still see my baby's face while nursing.
__label__pos	Great for keeping baby close
__label__pos	I hate changing fitted sheets and the zipper makes this a complete breeze.
__label__neu	I now have the Essentials Bag.
__label__pos	They are used frequently and really do hold up to alot of abuse.
__label__pos	The Diaper Champ is the best we found!There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!
__label__neu	Reviews had stated that the regular one was a bit large and we didn't feel we needed the heartbeat for my 16 month old.
__label__neg	I thought these were the answer based on all the great reviews they got on this site.
__label__pos	It's QUITE a necessity.
__label__neu	My husband says it looks like he has a football in his pants.
__label__pos	I highly recommend this plug cover!
__label__pos	I have had lots of people comment on just how comfortable it looks.
__label__pos	Highly recommend it.
__label__neg	It's too heavy to clip on anything
__label__pos	They washed up pretty nice.
__label__neu	We had the old square model where the inner lids in the pail are round and fold to the inside of the pail (that is the model in this picture).
__label__pos	The graphics and sides toys kept him more focused on fun & he was able to get some temporary relief.
__label__pos	This is the best.
__label__neu	So I hope you find my review just as helpful when deciding on your purchase.
__label__neg	Unfortunately it did not work in my very unusual doorway.
__label__pos	We even attach a soft dangling toy from it and it doesn't impede viewing our bundle of joy.
__label__neg	That's my only complaint though.
__label__neg	Yuck.
__label__pos	It does come with a strap to actually hook in between the seats and that's a lot easier to use.
__label__pos	Can say enough good things about this.
__label__neg	he likes the giraffe one much better....so lesson learned.
__label__pos	It is also great for keeping others from touching your baby when you don't want them to.
__label__pos	Nice set
__label__pos	It was really the onlt blanket I used to cover/wrap her.
__label__pos	I am so glad I registered for the Baby Bjorn carrier.
__label__pos	No spinning it or anyhting!
__label__pos	Before we could leave the music on continuously and he would watch contently for as long as we needed.
__label__pos	It fits in any sink you put it in, single or double, and it will save your back, not having to bend over your own bathtub.
__label__pos	It's great for parent/baby interaction together.I wish I would have thought to hang something like this over my son's changing table when he was younger.I will say that the only drawback is that it doesn't have a hook to hang it, so you have to find a way to secure it to the ceiling.
__label__neu	THAT USUALLY WORKS BUT SOMETIMES AFTER 2 OR 3 TRIES.
__label__pos	Absolutely Wonderful!
__label__neu	My son loves these, but they are horrible from a parent stand point.
__label__pos	Works Well For My Preemie
__label__pos	Its a pretty good wipe warmer.
__label__pos	With this sling, you get this lovely effect where the belt part goes below the belly and the crossover cinches itself to your chest after any length of wear.
__label__pos	For the price, it's a great purchase.
__label__pos	The Nuby sippy cups and The First Year disposable sippy cups are the only ones that my 12+ months son likes.
__label__neg	Negative is that it is expensive.
__label__neu	He gets to look at the world around him in the front facing position.
__label__pos	This item is wonderful for taking my baby outside for a walk.
__label__pos	The reading was very quick and easy to read.
__label__neu	She chews on it all the time.
__label__pos	This chair is a lifesaver!
__label__pos	this booster seat has been a lifesaver, I use it with my 2.5 year old who likes to sit at his table with it and with his 7 month old brother as a first high chair.
__label__pos	The Diaper Champ TRULY does not contain the odor of diapers at all.
__label__neu	This swing goes side to side and front to back.
__label__pos	It heats up the bottles well.
__label__pos	I couldn't be more pleased with this bottle sterilizer.
__label__pos	This uses much less water though and we can take the warming bottle to another room.
__label__neg	They were all bad accidents just waiting to happen.
__label__pos	LOVE IT!!
__label__neg	I would recommend trying a different brand.
__label__neu	Serves purpose but without class
__label__neu	I'm going to have to use the infant carrier until she grows another inch or so.
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	We could get away with dressing the baby in a onesie and then relied on these for extra warmth if there was a breeze.
__label__pos	We have such a hard time getting her to sleep in her crib, but she loves this chair.
__label__neg	I am requesting a replacement but we are disappointed in its workmanship as my baby just loves her Sleep Sheep!
__label__neu	Now, at 5 months, he can grab at the toys and hit the keys.
__label__neg	I found that to be a joke since I got this as a gift for my shower (no receipt) and the repair would take six weeks (how I'll never know why).
__label__neg	You have to put the whole cooler in the freezer...Who has room in their freezer/fridge for that?
__label__pos	I love it already...
__label__neu	If you want this product get the old square old version, which is the one in this picture.
__label__pos	Sippy Cup easy for baby to drink from
__label__pos	It's also so easy to operate that my baby figured out how to turn it on from about 3 months old.
__label__pos	I haven't had to purchase them, but I am really glad to know that they are available, should some part need to be replaced.
__label__pos	As soon as I gave to to my 5 month old son he loved it!
__label__neu	Pay the extra $$$ and get the Baby Bjorn, even if just the original model.
__label__neu	But, while traveling, you don't always have the ability to boil the product.
__label__pos	I love the colors they are just right together.
__label__pos	This product has worked great for us!
__label__pos	They were still plenty large enough to get the job done and are no means as small as a washcloth, etc.To me, if you love instant softness and a looser weave, get these.
__label__neg	I put the harness on the lowest setting and it's way above her shoulders still.
__label__neu	I still give her her bath in the bathroom, and just sit her tub in the big tub.
__label__neu	HOWEVER, it didn't make a difference in the amount of hours he slept.
__label__neg	ALso, it takes SO MANY batteries, it's ridiculous.
__label__neu	"Not sure if this says anyhting about the ""anti-colic nipples"", but whatever.Here are some of the major comments I have:LEAKING-They only leak if you don't dry them completely or put the lid on wrong."
__label__pos	My son didn't seem to mind!
__label__pos	Great Tub
__label__neg	"Another issue is that although our baby meets the height/weight requirements, she doesn't meet the ""seated shoulder height"" requirement."
__label__neg	Avoid this product if you don't want it breaking
__label__neu	I did a side by side comparison of these Gerber organic diapers and the Gerber premium prefold cloth diapers which are also quite popular by purchasing a 6-pack of each, for the same price.I washed them all in a regular load of whites with regular detergent and no fabric softener, and dried them on medium.
__label__pos	She sleeps in the swing longer than she sleeps in her bed.
__label__neg	It pours!
__label__neg	Well I somehow ended up getting the Isis manual Breast Pump in the mail for free & the only thing I can say is that I'm glad I didn't shell out money for this pump!
__label__pos	We got this at our baby shower and I kept on using it until a few days ago - our baby just turned 4 weeks :-).It really helps in latching the baby on and seems comfortable for him.
__label__pos	We have three dogs, and I need my hands free to walk the dogs, but I like for the baby to come along, too.
__label__pos	Within minutes you have a perfectly warmed bottle for your baby.
__label__neu	Weird.
__label__pos	It is large enough that all three of us can comforatbly lay on it.
__label__pos	They do look a little cuter in the pic, but they're nice none the less.
__label__pos	There's a fish mobile that spins, a light that changes colors (very cool) and your choice of noises that range from music to waves and it swings on top of that!
__label__pos	I now only use it twice in the evening after my baby is in bed.
__label__pos	As a bonus, you can buy an extra camera through the manufacturer, and set it up in another room... that way you can use one channel for one room, and the other for another (like if you have two kids!).
__label__neu	It also came with the base for the car and seatbelt hookup.
__label__pos	It's the only way she like to travel.
__label__neg	too big/too small
__label__neg	Lots of leaks with disposables.
__label__pos	My son prefers this to the potty chair!
__label__pos	I absolutely love them.
__label__pos	"We tried every ""tub"" for newborns out there, then I decided to use this to give my newborn a bath."
__label__pos	I've had a couple of other different swings to keep at their houses and neither of them are as wonderful as this one.
__label__pos	I Stopped using it and purchased the Cuisinart baby food maker and it is awesome!!
__label__neg	When you put things in those pockets, you feel like they are lost forever.
__label__neu	Outside of Amazon my favorite brand by far is Thirsties.
__label__neg	My other complaint is that is is bulky and big and if you live in a little house like we do there is no room for it.
__label__pos	"Yes.I am fairly short (5'4"") and have absolutely no problem with the height of the handles."
__label__pos	This bouncer has bought us and our daughter hours of sleep already, and she is only 9 days old!
__label__pos	Great Crib
__label__neu	!
__label__neu	!
__label__neu	We still have not gone past first gear.
__label__pos	My daughter is tall so this seat was perfect for her and will fit her until she's 65 lbs.
__label__pos	Fortunately Babies R Us will allow you to exchange the damaged item if it has been 90 days or less.
__label__neu	I kept thinking she just needed to get used to the nipple flow, so I stuck with it.
__label__neu	Alas, I finally gave up and spent my cash on the active carrier to get the back support.
__label__neg	When I first put her in it at about 2 weeks old, she didn't like it.
__label__pos	Also, the night feature is excellent  it casts no ambient lighting in the room at all, but works perfectly.
__label__neu	He slept in it from day 1.The storage drawer is very shallow and can only hold a very thin blanket or sheets.The quality seems very high.
__label__neu	Then when my son passed the 15 lb mark and was able to straddle my torso we switched to the Ergo.
__label__pos	They stay moist and if you really wanted to you could use a scissor and cut them in half because the sheets are very large.
__label__neu	The new oval version does not work as well, also get the smaller size model -the dekor not the dekor plus.-
__label__pos	A LIFE SAVER!!
__label__neg	Too thin
__label__neu	The clip that holds that carseat is hard to get right, but that will be the same with any carseat you buy.
__label__pos	This nifty rack is well designed and well thought-out, doesn't take up too much counter space but provides a lot of drying surface, is dishwasher-friendly and lets you dry bottles, pump parts, etc in their own clean space.
__label__pos	The perfect kit!
__label__neg	At 6 weeks when we tried again it fit around well, but if he straightens his legs it's too short and comes off his shoulders, freeing his arms.
__label__pos	So far we are extremely happy with this gate.
__label__pos	I purchased the safer bather and sat in the bath tub with her... she loved it!
__label__pos	Totally worth the money you spend on it.
__label__pos	Our daughter LOVES this toy.
__label__pos	It has a lot of variances in ways to carry and the pocket on the outside is extremely handy.However, when you live in the south and have this on over anything, it's very HOT.
__label__neu	Best for 15+ lb babies
__label__pos	It was very easy to secure it to the infant car seat canopy.
__label__pos	It cost $30, which is more than the other tubs, but well worth the money.
__label__pos	It seems good quality and the seems are well made.The photos do not do justice to the cuteness of this toy!
__label__pos	Product is great.
__label__neu	If you buy the Gerber baby food that comes in plastic tubs, it won't work on this organizer.
__label__pos	They replaced my bag for free.
__label__pos	It allows me to get down on the floor with her and spend time with her!
__label__neu	!
__label__neu	We actuly wore out our first one and had to get another.
__label__pos	Looks good, and easy to manuever with one hand
__label__neu	It does have a wall plug which works but it makes it less portable.
__label__neu	There is also no trick to it.
__label__pos	Couldn't be more thrilled.
__label__neg	The different ways it attaches to your car should work with any car.
__label__neg	My son's bottles leak when they are tipped over, this thing is like a slow faucet, 10-15 minutes and it's empty.
__label__neu	So, when I pull out the cover to use the vacuum, I can clip the cover to the cord.
__label__pos	Loved it, but defective
__label__pos	When I found this monitor offered DECT technology, I jumped on it because I've been very pleased with the quality of sound from my DECT wireless phones.This wireless monitor is just as good as my phones.
__label__neu	I tried the Bjorn type stool (too small & short to work, too light to stay in place)  the Mommie Cushie stepup (terribly unstable)  and the KidKraft wooden step stool with lid (sturdy, tall enough, heavy enough to stay in place, but might slip on tile, might be slippery when wet, no rails).
__label__pos	The camera works great and the picture is clear.
__label__pos	When I got home and took it out of the package, I realized that the seams weren't sewn very well at the top and stuffing was starting to poke out of the seams!I went back and exchanged it for the plain bopppy & this luxe slipcover... Am I happy I did!!!
__label__pos	Please don't waste your time with the others-----you get what you pay for in this case.
__label__pos	Our son loves his bed.
__label__pos	We'll use them with our next baby and will recommend to them to ANYONE that will listen.
__label__pos	Then, when my daughter was about 8-months-old, I found a pack on super clearance.
__label__pos	My three-month old loves it.
__label__pos	I would highly recommend this item.
__label__pos	The pattern is soothing and classy, with muted blues and yellows.
__label__pos	It always works fine with us!
__label__neg	I can't comfortably move the front seats forward any more than they are.
__label__neg	We returned it for a Graco Ultra CarGo.The arm rests on Coscos are a joke.
__label__pos	Nice bibs.
__label__pos	We had the Graco Laura Ashley travel system and I used this frequently during the 8 months that my daughter fit in her infant seat.
__label__neg	A day or so after my daughter's birth, one of my nipples became cracked, which caused a lot of pain every time I tried to nurse on that side.
__label__pos	What could be better than laying your head on a pillow to eat?
__label__pos	- won't topple over.REGULAR GARBAGE BAGSOne hand use.
__label__neu	Bought this on a whim.
__label__neu	IT'S ALSO HARD TO UNFOLD BUT I FOUND OUT THAT IF U CAN'T GET IT UNFOLDED U SHOULD PULL IT TOGETHER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THEN UNHOOK IT AND UNFOLD IT.
__label__pos	My baby was comfortable in it from the beginning and it is so quiet we don't even notice it.
__label__pos	My daughter loves ours
__label__neu	Let me say I have every band of frequency running through my home, Wireless N, G, B 5.8 GHZ phone, RF remotes, etc.
__label__neu	Switched to cups with straws.
__label__pos	I love mine and it is softer now then first use and it is secure so she does not slide like when we tried a towel on the changing pad.Have had the same 2 since February and look like new.
__label__neu	I knew I was having a boy and chose to go with this design since it will probably only be a couple of years before he will be asking for a room with the latest superhero or sports theme.
__label__neg	The one thing I don't like is it doesn't have a rechargable battery like some other monitors.
__label__neu	In addition, the alternative with such youngsters (when they are too young to fully have impulse control) is to secure them in a stroller, carrier or backpack.
__label__pos	They don't just feel secure, they really are secure.I tried three other types of stools.
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	I think this product should come in the box with the Baby Bjorn  it's essential!
__label__pos	It is a great tub, and a great price!
__label__pos	great sterilizer for everything!
__label__pos	It is wonderful.
__label__neu	Now we are making the transition to the Eurobath, which I recommend now that she's a little bigger.
__label__pos	So much fun.
__label__pos	You won't be disappointed.
__label__pos	Lightweight & versatile!
__label__pos	They are much larger than traditional receiving blankets, so they can be used for swaddling, as a coverup for nursing, and for shielding the stroller and carseat on really sunny days.
__label__pos	The assembly was really easy when it came in the mail.
__label__pos	She LOVES the sounds and lights.
__label__pos	In fact i bought extra sets to leave at the grandparent's houses!
__label__neg	Not useful at all!
__label__pos	Batteries last forever in this swing, it folds up, swings strongly, and is comfy for the baby!
__label__neg	Blankets don't work well, and are constantly slipping, plus you can't see the baby very easily.This nursing cover fixes all those problems.
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	Perfect!
__label__neu	We started with another mobile--the Tiny Love Musical Symphony.
__label__neu	For him the whole benefit of being swaddled is that his arms are held in and he doesn't wake himself with them.
__label__pos	It's easy to clean and saves you time on having to clean out a steamer, and processor.
__label__neg	I have to give two stars, though, since it was useless for us.
__label__neu	!.....I'm pretty sure there is a recall.
__label__pos	Great for everywhere
__label__pos	i've been using the pillow for about a month now, and would HIGHLY recommend this pillow for expecting mothers.
__label__pos	She shakes them and giggles and smiles when different soothing and peaceful music sounds comes out.
__label__pos	This diaper pail is excellent.
__label__neg	For me it's a hassle and barely fits in the basket in my stroller.
__label__pos	looks like a good idea.
__label__pos	Love this monitor
__label__neg	It could include a scissor.However when we first opened the hard plastic case, half of the contents fell out, since they are not secured inside it.
__label__neg	However, they leaked and formula would actually squirt from the sides of my boys mouth.I tried the Dr. Browns, and my boys took right to them.
__label__pos	Good Wipe Warmer
__label__neg	I haven't used it again after the first time.
__label__pos	Great product to go with Superyard XT
__label__pos	It gives him a cushy padding that makes his bath more pleasurable.
__label__pos	I started having my son sit on this and the potty chair when he turned 14 months and he actually prefers sitting on this than the potty chair that is low to the ground.
__label__pos	What's not to love?UPDATE: Ok, still using after ten or so months and my one complaint is that the bottom rack sits too flush to the base, meaning mold tends to build underneath where the water is trapped.
__label__pos	My son is picky about teething toys, but he actually enjoyed this one.
__label__pos	And I didn't mind wearing it.
__label__neu	90 inches wide, can be bunched up for narrower windows), fitted sheet, & diaper stacker.
__label__pos	With this product, he stays warm all through the night because he can't kick it off.
__label__pos	I had no problems at all with these bottles and i would highly recommend them.
__label__pos	The pocket is a nice touch (you put your Lansinoh, cell phone, baby nail clippers, etc in it) The only possible downside is it isn't that easy to put on with one hand (for example, if you are already cradling the baby)If you're price sensitive look around, there are often significant discounts for older colors.If you've found this review helpful, please let me know!
__label__neg	the reason i took one star away is that on each arm there are 3 shapes that slide around, making too much sound for my daughter.
__label__pos	Bottom line, my son has enjoyed his Bright Starts Around We go for three times as long and counting.
__label__neu	Does it give me a place to put her when we are out running errands on the weekend.
__label__pos	This is one of the items that we have purchased that I am completely satisfied with.
__label__pos	Bottles that grow with your child
__label__pos	I bought this mobile for our little girl to hang over her changing table.
__label__pos	My baby feels secure, its the ultimate in custom adjustibility and size is not a factor.
__label__pos	It's very discreet and it has a very good size (not too big, not too small).
__label__pos	Good sheet
__label__pos	After being dried, they took on a bubbly, muslin-like appearance, where the premiums were crisp, solid and flat.
__label__pos	It's a great item to take from room to room.
__label__pos	these ones i feel the most comfortable giving to her to walk around with to munch on.
__label__neu	*~
__label__neu	I have to admit there is a lot going on for batteries.
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	Our son can enjoy the outdoors in snuggly comfort (and his mom can still exercise in the winter!
__label__pos	This product is fabulous!
__label__pos	It's a good one, but short-lived
__label__pos	I needed a tub that would be good for my very small son.
__label__pos	It supports her great.
__label__pos	Easy to clean, and easy to hold.
__label__pos	It was a great value for the money in our opinion.
__label__pos	Great foot and hand finder
__label__pos	Sometimes I'll hear it come on in the middle of the night if he wakes up, and it helps get him back to sleep.
__label__pos	I can already tell that it will serve it's purpose perfectly!
__label__pos	And the prints are simple and adorable.
__label__neu	I haven't used the night light yet, but I may in the future.
__label__pos	To me, this also justifies the cost.
__label__pos	I really like the fabric (including soft suede like fabric) and the textured animals on the bed skirt, bumper, quilt & valance.
__label__pos	Great pump!
__label__neu	Don't get the plus, and get the old model
__label__pos	I still don't let go of hem for obvious reasons, but this seat is much safer!
__label__pos	Right now, I have it thumbtacked up there, which is working fine, but once she gets older and is able to reach it, I'll have to hang it more securely.
__label__neu	I have this on the cabinets in my kitchen, on the ones that are on the bottom.
__label__pos	It is also nice that is has the waterproof fabric on both sides so it is very easy to clean.
__label__pos	It did hold all of the Ventaire part well which that would be the only plus for this item.The wide neck bottles fit better in the dryer but still didn't fit well.
__label__pos	Even though it is a bit pricey, I feel I will get my money's worth because I plan on using it for more than one child and I know it will last long enough to do so.
__label__pos	They are super absorbent, very easy to clean and a perfect size for many different things.
__label__neu	He wasn't into these at all, the linking things was sort of interesting but just not that great.
__label__pos	It was relatively simple, and I love it already.
__label__pos	The stage 1 nipple on the Vent Aire is slow, but my baby keeps all her formula down now.
__label__pos	A top 5 I couldn't live without
__label__pos	My baby was born in June and we used these every single day - for swadding at night, to place on the floor or sofa, to cover the bassinet from sunlight, to cover myself when nursing, etc.
__label__pos	Not only that it is thick and fluffy, like a good quality mattress cover should be to add softness and quality of sleep to a bed.
__label__pos	Ultimately, they've basically replaced all the other blankets we were cycling through (at least until fall).
__label__pos	Great gift idea for a nursing mother.
__label__pos	The nipple never had a chance to heal because I was breastfeeding every few hours.
__label__neu	But, we still have the safer bather for our baths together!
__label__neu	All I can hear is static, no matter what channel I use or where I place it in my house!!
__label__neu	I am starting to notice an oder escape from the diaper pail but it's nothing that I cannot handle.
__label__pos	I don't have a lot of freezer space and I like to offer my daughter a variety of foods, so, making a pound of sweet potatos at one time would do me no good.
__label__pos	Excellent for a multitude of uses
__label__pos	This has worked so much better than rolled up towels which are constantly moving.
__label__pos	"We got this bag for my husband so it looked ""cool"" for him.I used it on a trip with my infant and it was the best option."
__label__pos	Fabulously Affordable
__label__neu	I keep thinking he's just too small and is getting lost in it, but even as he grows I am still trying to make him more comfortable by adding a blanket to position him better.
__label__neu	The dangling fish and seahorse aren't removable.
__label__pos	I am very happy with this crib.
__label__pos	A must have for nursing moms
__label__pos	As a mom who knows a lot of other mom's with little ones, I can honestly say that we all agree...the Diaper Genie is the best!!!!
__label__pos	My first daughter likes these and was bottled fed only.
__label__pos	works very well
__label__pos	Life Saver
__label__pos	It also comes with a nice sized changing pad.
__label__neu	The set is made of fabrics with different textures.
__label__neg	Our son was always banging his legs into the darned things, until one day he propped a foot up on the fish and pushed -- it broke right off!
__label__pos	Probably not the best analogy, but I'm really glad I have the soother.
__label__pos	I wish i had this diaper back pack to start with.
__label__pos	the best product ever invented
__label__neg	And then, it takes a LONG time to heat up the bottle.
__label__pos	A MUST for a summer baby
__label__pos	Great fun for baby!
__label__pos	Great for travel.
__label__neg	pick something else
__label__pos	I bought two in size medium and love them.
__label__pos	On the up side, it is light.
__label__neu	We had it stored for awhile and then brought it out again to use in her high chair.
__label__pos	"I also bought ""The Ultimate Swaddling Blanket"" and it was just ok - these are much bigger and more useful."
__label__neu	After trial and error with soothing and trying to get my baby down for naps and bedtime without crying and upset, I recently purchased the Sleep Sheep on the Go.
__label__pos	Great for a first chair!
__label__pos	This toy is wonderful.
__label__pos	Love the fish design and the hammock.
__label__pos	It is for the safety of the child.
__label__neu	He uses it more to throw at things than to chew on.
__label__pos	I still had a free hand!
__label__pos	Helpful
__label__pos	I highly recommend this seat!
__label__pos	Worth every penny.
__label__neg	They have leaked on me b/f but only occasionally when they are wet.
__label__neg	Waste of money
__label__pos	Makes bathing easier
__label__neg	However, it was really loud and honestly just kept my son awake since it was so stimulating!
__label__neu	The diaper bag clipped to the suitcase handle and rested in the car seat.Yes, security is difficult no matter what, but I simply un-hooked only the top of the 3 clips and slid the straps down the suitcase.
__label__pos	I highly recommend this.
__label__pos	Much safer than the old blue seat or any seat with suction cups!
__label__neu	We should get two though - one for each car.
__label__neu	Able to see well at night too.
__label__pos	Dr. Brown's bottles are the BEST BOTTLES ON THE MARKET!
__label__pos	If you choose to get one, this wipe warmer is great!
__label__neu	With so much of the baby out of the water, my baby got cold very quickly.
__label__neg	"The ""new"" design still needs lots of improvement!"
__label__neu	Our queen size bed is getting crowded so we thought we'd try the cosleeper this time.
__label__pos	good walker
__label__pos	Great seat but doesn't fit my car
__label__pos	The Potty Stool is a wonderful stool.
__label__pos	The two monitors linked up immediately.This monitor solves my problem and gives me peace of mind.
__label__pos	Very good booster
__label__neg	I CAN'T EVEN PUT MY DIAPER BAG IN THERE, I HAVE TO PUT IT IN BEFORE I ATTATCH THE CARSEAT AND THEN I CAN'T GET IT OUT.
__label__pos	And I highly recommend it.
__label__neu	Perhaps it does fit some babies, but ours is pretty average in terms of size.
__label__neg	I would not recommend this type of carrier to anyone.
__label__pos	I like it otherwise.
__label__pos	We wouldn't want to sterilize any other way!
__label__pos	I started pumping about 2 weeks ago and find that this product works very well.
__label__pos	The folding is super quick with the soft plastic guide so that even my husband can do it neatly.
__label__neu	Beside toddler need music, it is good to introduce them in early age and this only works when they move it.
__label__pos	The big fluffy pillow is perfect for those babies that are still wobbly but sitting up.
__label__neu	We stopped needing the snuzzler in her infant seat at about 4 months old.
__label__neu	My husband and I originally tried the Avent bottles after several recommendations from previous users and after doing some research on our own.
__label__neg	Its reception is HORRIBLE!
__label__neu	We've added some toys to the velcro loops supplied on the seat and he just goes to town with them.
__label__neu	Not Just for Monitoring Babies
__label__pos	love the design, great quality, full of different textures for baby, can be machine washed, fun little doudou )
__label__neu	Then baby wants to flip it up or take it off.
__label__neg	They also don't link together very easily and once together they don't stay together.
__label__neu	So if at all possible I would advise borrowing one from a friend to try out first to see if you can have any success before purchasing this pump.
__label__pos	This changing table cover is perfect for just about any changing pad.
__label__pos	It fits easily into my diaper bag, it's lightweight enough that my baby and I don't swelter in the heat, it's wide enough to cover all of me, and I love that I can see my baby while I'm feeding her.
__label__pos	And it comes in lots of great patterns, that are modern and not matronly.
__label__neu	I think there is a little less burping after using these, but the extra parts to clean when you take the bottom off can be a nuisance.
__label__neu	This caused liquid to run out, which he then smeared around.
__label__pos	It gave me the opportunity to get a shower and promoted independence for my little guy.It is durable, cute, and easy to clean (machine wash fabric).My son loved the ocean waves/water sounds when he was younger, and then he enjoyed the baby activated feature (baby's movements activate the sound and bubbles) when he got a little older.Now, I am preparing my nursery for TWINS, and am searching for another bouncer exactly like this one!
__label__neu	I registered for and received the Eurobath by Primo, but my daughter was just a little too small for the tub.
__label__neg	It also stopped working altogether and this happened the same day it arrived.
__label__pos	It saves your last reading so you dont have to try and remember what it was last time to know if your baby's temp is better or worse.
__label__neg	The company has lost my trust -- I will no longer buy any Baby Einstein products.
__label__pos	ALSO, IT IS BPA-FREE!
__label__neg	It sucks batteries like there's no tomorrow.
__label__pos	We have loved all of the different feature as our daughter has grown.
__label__pos	Hope it works out for you.
__label__pos	This is a great swaddle blanket especially if you have a big baby that can wiggle out of most other blankets.
__label__pos	"I prefer the ""real"" carriers though."
__label__pos	I LOVE IT!
__label__neu	!
__label__neg	The only thing I don't like about this kit is that there really isn't a handle to hold it with and it is kind of bulky but other than that its great.
__label__neg	receiver and monitor are in the same location with the same channel)- Random spikes in the volume of the receiverOverall, its not a good product and fisher price should be ashamed to have their name attached to it.
__label__pos	I also like that it's cotton, and it seems like a good weight and well constructed.
__label__pos	He likes to see the stars on his ceiling at night.
__label__pos	Buy this monitor!
__label__pos	You can take the sheet off easily by just removing the snaps attached around your crib slats.
__label__pos	A Must Have - Great for naps
__label__pos	My kiddo goes everywhere in his carseat and loves it.
__label__pos	Baby goes upstairs with me...baby goes downstairs with Daddy.
__label__pos	So easy to use, it's the only one I ever used!
__label__pos	I love this bouncer.
__label__pos	He liked it.
__label__pos	The handheld unit works great throughout the house (3600sqft)although it doesnt work if I go out in the driveway, I bought a cheap $20 one that takes care of that.
__label__neg	"The wipes at the bottom will dry out and turn brown within just a few days, and the insert for ""pop-up"" wipes won't stay down in the unit, so it just comes out with the wipes, making it impossible to grab a wipe with one hand."
__label__neg	Piece of junk
__label__pos	I decided on this tub and I have to say I am very happy.
__label__neu	MY FOUR YEARS OLD SON LIKES TO SHAKE IT TOO.THEY ARE NOT LOUD AND MAKES INTERESTING SOUNDS.
__label__neu	"About the color, it is a little more ""minty green"" than sage despite the picture."
__label__neu	I have 15 month old twins and they haven't tried to pull them out.
__label__neg	It bends if you accidentally put all your weight on it, and it's hard to find that sweet-spot it was in before.
__label__pos	Very soft and plush
__label__pos	The armholes also fit nicely without being too wide.
__label__neu	We ordered this for my wife because she was a little uncomfortable with breastfeeding in public, mainly because of having to expose her midriff with most shirts.
__label__neu	Works but...
__label__pos	That's the biggest selling point for me.Also, the fabric is wonderful.
__label__neg	This does fold up nice and small, but it is useless.
__label__neu	You can convert your bottles into sippy cups!!!
__label__neg	Why don't they make it so your thumb presses the button like on a sink???
__label__pos	I guess that is the one reviewed by consumer reports and recommended.
__label__pos	Perfect!
__label__pos	However, I would still not recommend any other tub but this one.
__label__neg	I wish it was longer since my 3 month old baby is almost too big for it now.
__label__neg	After he repeated this process for several days I was tired of cleanign up the mess and the spout finally acquired a little tear which caused liquid to leak out steadily.
__label__neu	I would recommend using the 2nd level for babies that are very active, this way they learn cause and effect.
__label__pos	I Love this monitor.
__label__pos	LOVE THIS BOUNCER!!!
__label__neu	It is also an ample size comparable to the majority of larger baby hampers.
__label__pos	I've heard the hospital models are great but this works for me so I'm happy.
__label__pos	This is definitely one of our favorite purchases!
__label__pos	The vibration is great for soothing him and now that he's 3 months he's learning how to make the sound and bubbles go off with his own movement.
__label__pos	My baby doesn't seem to mind cold wipes.I still use the organizer, though, and I like it.
__label__pos	My son is almost two years old and loves this turtle.
__label__pos	The best thing i found about these toothbrushes are that they are not a straight long typical brush, because these bow out into an oval it makes it harder for a child to accidently swallow or push too far back into their mouths.
__label__pos	It's nice to be able to provide a little extra comfort.I use pampers sensitive pop-up wipes, and sometimes two pop out instead of one, but it's really no problem...how many times do you use just one wipe anyway?
__label__neg	Even if it did fit I still would have had to return it since she knew how to open it.
__label__neg	The clip also slips and does not hold on tightly to the bar, and the velcro is not secure enough to rely on alone.We also thought it would be good to hang on our pack n' play, but it is too heavy to clip on anything.
__label__pos	very useful
__label__neg	Never really fun
__label__pos	For the price I think its the best choice out there.
__label__pos	I had a ton of bottles, so I didn't want to spend the extra money for the breast milk storage containers.
__label__pos	Perfect bottle
__label__pos	This is something I will buy as a gift for friends.
__label__pos	It was obvious he really liked it by the big smiles and how his mind was preoccupied with the play items on the sides and bottom.
__label__pos	Also when my husband lets me sleep in on weekends, he feeds the baby either formula or some cooled breastmilk if it's available.
__label__pos	I actually tried many bottles before I splurged and bought these.I spent alot of money on the Avent bottles because they were supposed to be the closest to the breast.
__label__neg	Even in its most inclined position, it isn't comfortable, legs are at a 90 degrees angle which is horrible for a newborn, and the baby's head is never well supported.Better buy a Maxi Cosi or an other infant seat !
__label__pos	I mostly buy Earth's Best baby food and it fits perfectly.
__label__pos	This also ensures that the next wipe (the one on top) will be the warmest...that makes sense!
__label__neu	Later she kicked off her blankets when in her crib.
__label__neu	I thought that he would have to turn sideways to get through the door and would not like it once used on a regular basis.
__label__neu	This tub comes with a sling that can be used while they are newborn and thenyou can remove it and then use the tub in the other two positions that is made for.
__label__neu	I was very nervous/paranoid about taking him to Yellowstone so I bought this.
__label__pos	I really like this bottle warmer.
__label__pos	My son isn't old enough to appreciate it yet but I certainly do!
__label__neu	I looked at several buggy covers in various price ranges.
__label__pos	I think it's a great product, just that my 15 mo daughter is too independent to like it... she likes playing with it, instead...
__label__pos	One of my baby's faves!
__label__neg	The first two were broken and the basket wouldn't hook on and the third one was broken and could not bend in the middle.
__label__neu	All the other nipples i tried with other bottles weren't marked so i had no idea which ones were slow flow and fast flow after i had sterilized them all.
__label__neg	That said, I have one major complaint with this bouncer...
__label__pos	It is reasonably priced and works great.
__label__pos	Great Product!
__label__neg	I called the company to try and order those lids separately, but they do NOT!
__label__neu	They can rip out the filter that keeps the odors inside.
__label__pos	I've tried them all and these are the BEST
__label__pos	This changing pad cover feels luxuriously soft and plush, and it's nice to know our baby's head is resting on something so comfortable.
__label__neu	It's 4 screws and an allen key (supplied) and otherwise snaps together.
__label__pos	He's still getting use to taking a bath and he cried much louder in a normal tub.
__label__neg	they do kinda change color when I used Similac powder formula, not cows milk though.
__label__pos	Just wash the nipple and nipple ring and your ready to go for you next feeding.
__label__neu	The diaper dekor plus now is oval and the inner lid is square.
__label__pos	Very sweet for a baby.
__label__pos	Battery lasts forever when off charger.
__label__pos	We walked all over Washington DC and the way the bag is designed to carry (it sits on your back), it was very comfortable to tote for a long period of time.
__label__pos	(My son slumps in the restaurant ones, but since the tray can be adjusted in and out, it holds him up better (3) adjustable height so he can sit up and see the table
__label__neu	Obviously, not helpful for those using pumped breastmilk, but much less hassle for those using formula.
__label__neu	It is a black hole!
__label__neu	Thank goodness I always held on to her.
__label__pos	The little pockets on the side are handy for a tube of diaper rash ointment, etc.
__label__pos	The colors are bright and fun for baby to look at.
__label__neg	And Avent is SO expensive!
__label__neu	Small on counter space, big on drying space
__label__neg	Followed mounting instructions multiple times, this absolutely DOES NOT stay up on my type of cermiac tile -- a rough surface that is not slick/shiny.
__label__neu	The Snuzzler is reversable for summer or winter and is adjustable as the baby grows.
__label__neu	It does fit in the kitchen sink though.
__label__neg	It either under or overheats about half the time.
__label__neu	I compared his old with his new and they changed them, WHY?!?!?!?!
__label__pos	I have used this pump for 5 months and been very happy with it.
__label__neu	I tried every bottle imaginable for my daughter.
__label__pos	A great product.
__label__neu	It also has most of the same great features.My only dilemma is we ordered the leg extension set because we have a pillowtop mattress, making our bed rather high.
__label__neu	I went back and forth about purchasing this item and decided to go for it.
__label__pos	My daughter is very comfortable in it.
__label__neu	It's great to have a clean surface on which to put our babies food and not to have to carry dishes with us when we travel.
__label__pos	Fabulous.
__label__pos	It's a full size booster seat so it is big.OTHER COMMENTS: It worked so well when we were abroad that now I keep this in the trunk of my car.
__label__pos	Good but could be better
__label__neu	I know it's out of the way and I also know where all of the parts are.Get some extra sealing discs.
__label__neu	You can use these bottles from newborns to toddlers.
__label__pos	All the pieces come off and are easy to put back on for cleaning.
__label__neu	The zip is inverted which allows for quick diaper changes without unzipping the whole bag.
__label__neu	!
__label__neu	Plus, your hands are free when you don't have to hold them.
__label__neu	I ended up using a regular old baby tub, which if I twisted just the right way, fits under my bathroom sink.I was using this with a newborn, perhaps it would be better with an older baby.
__label__neu	As it is now, you have to switch the button back and forth between the two rooms to monitor children sleeping at the same time.
__label__neu	It is not a compact tub, but smaller than some of the other huge 4 in 1 tubs.
__label__pos	I love crinkling the bear head and watching my son squee with happiness.The fact this is organic cotton is also a nice touch since the toy does spend a lot of time in the mouth.
__label__pos	It works quickly and it's so easy to use.
__label__pos	On a whim i contacted JJ Cole customer service and they WERE AWESOME.
__label__pos	I love this bather and could NOT do without it!
__label__neg	"This means that if the wheels are dirty, there is no ""clean side."""
__label__pos	I also don't have to worry about it slipping off my shoulders.
__label__neu	I guess it doesn't matter anyway since you should ALWAYS check the water temp before putting your little one in it, but I thought it would have been a cool feature had it actually worked.
__label__pos	Definitely worth every penny.
__label__neu	You can try again since it only takes seconds.
__label__pos	This is great for me because it is less clean up!Would highly recommend!
__label__pos	It was named #1 by American Baby this year.
__label__pos	I recommend!
__label__pos	I finally just gave up onit and purchased the aquarium bath which I really like.
__label__pos	10X Better than Boppy, easy to clean, use it standing up!
__label__pos	Light and breathable, but yet substantial.
__label__neu	I'm a pediatrician and was skeptical about using this, since I'd never seen it in use in any medical office.
__label__pos	I highly recommend this item to all mothers, especially if you plan on breasfeeding!
__label__neu	I think there are 2 reasons for this.
__label__pos	I like the items this kit contains.
__label__pos	It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it's fairly inexpensive as baby products go!
__label__pos	Ours gets lots of use every day and yet looks like it just came out of the box brand new.
__label__pos	If they've got a microwave, then you're ready to go.It's also very durable.
__label__pos	It keeps all my baby food jars nice and organized.
__label__neu	I just got this bedding for my son from Babies R Us.
__label__neg	Made my baby spit up at every feeding!
__label__neu	I wwasn't sure what all the bad reviews were for.
__label__pos	This one was definitely worth the extra money!
__label__pos	very quiet
__label__pos	OTHER THAN THAT I WOULD RECOMMENDED IT!!
__label__neu	and this is it.
__label__pos	Gets the job done
__label__pos	good
__label__pos	It also has a backlight on the screen so you can use it in the dark, which is nice if the child/baby is sleeping and you dont want to turn the light on and wake him/her up to take their temp.And I LOVE the way to folds up inside itself so you dont worry about loosing the cap or cover, which I always do.This is a quality thermometer and especially for the price!!
__label__neu	He still wakes up every 3 hours at night.
__label__neu	So every few seconds, the lid has to be removed to allow air back in, the nipple returns to normal position and then lid put back on.
__label__neu	I was able to start using it as soon as my baby was born because he weighed over 8 pounds.
__label__neu	I just use that as a sign to empty it, spray with Lysol and replace the bag.
__label__neg	My only complaint is that occassionally my feet will hit the rear wheels when walking.When folded, two wheels end up at the top and two at the bottom.
__label__neu	Have not found a chair that we couldn't hook onto.CONS: lots of straps.
__label__pos	You can set it for just nature sounds if you don't like the music.
__label__neu	A good stretch of time for baby growing into different stages of life.
__label__neg	For those largely pregnant, just find yourself the tiniest halter top, crop top, or babydoll tee you can and put it on (if you can), then take a long sash and cinch it up under your belly... that's what you're going to look like in this thing.
__label__pos	It supports her, so she's comfy while she eats.
__label__pos	I have been using this brand since my daughter was 6 months old and have had no problems with any of the slow, medium, or fast flow nipples.
__label__pos	This pump works better for me then the one from the hospital!
__label__neu	I'll keep trying...
__label__pos	Does exactly what we want it to do.
__label__neu	She even kicks the bar to make the music start!
__label__neu	My son very quickly learned to hold these upside down and press the soft spout against any flat surface.
__label__pos	I have never had them crack or break.
__label__neu	I've eaten over my daughter many evenings!
__label__pos	This fit the bill.
__label__pos	"It may seem unnecessary to some people (""just use a blanket"") but when you're new to breastfeeding and need to be able to see the baby to get her latched on, it's a lifesaver!"
__label__pos	I don't know what I would do without it.
__label__pos	It looks great.
__label__pos	It's really a high quality product.
__label__pos	It's great for cosleeping and for nursing in bed.
__label__neu	Yes, I know that diapers stink, but there's no reason for my little girl's entire room to smell like one.
__label__neg	But I wish it were longer so it sat beneath the highchair tray.
__label__neu	I was not sure how to fly by myself with my active 16 month old.
__label__pos	Once you have the neck adjusted where you like, you can just slip on and off over your head.Probably the most ingenious feature of this cover is the pliable plastic bridge at the top of the cover, allowing the cover to stay away from your body so you can actually peer down and see your child.
__label__pos	I own the ocean wonders aquarium which is still in my older daughters room she still loves that so much she didn't want to pass it on to the new baby.
__label__pos	I highly recommend this product.
__label__pos	It is definitely worth the price.
__label__neu	Bright Lights!
__label__pos	excellent chair
__label__pos	It is light weight, fits easily in my tiny trunk and my daughter seems happy in it.
__label__pos	She has used it for all 3 of our children and the foam hasn't lost it's shape.
__label__neu	If not, skip this item.
__label__neg	I quickly gave them up.
__label__pos	My son likes to look at the different animals on the bumper while he falls asleep.The set comes with 6 pieces - bed skirt, bumper, quilt, valance (approx.
__label__neg	Normally I wouldn't care so much, but there was a VERY sharp piece of plastic left that we couldn't remove...
__label__pos	I love these bottles.VARIABLE FLOW- There are several different grades of nipples.
__label__neu	When my baby started chewing on the teether toys that are part of this jumper (the yellow sun and the bead chaser) I wrote to the company to make sure these toys don't contain BPA and other harmful chemicals.
__label__neu	You can find generic liners that work and fit just as well, to cut back on cost.
__label__pos	So far, I love all of the Baby Einstein items that we have purchased!
__label__pos	love it, light up automatically in water, react quickly to a change of temp and alert you by a little bip if water is to low or high.
__label__pos	He's three months now and still loves it.
__label__pos	she loves the feel of it and that toys can be hung on the loops!
__label__neg	Even my husband can't squirt about half the toys.
__label__pos	The different angles make it versatile.
__label__pos	We have a bouncer and she prefers the swing a 1000 times over.
__label__neu	Perhaps wrapping the arms down too far caused this?
__label__pos	Thanks for making this tub
__label__pos	It seems pretty easy to clean (I've wiped it down and mildly cleaned it - nothing too serious as it hasn't gotten that dirty).
__label__neg	But then the collars and nipples were really too big to work with this rack.
__label__pos	I have washed and dried the sheet and had no problems what-so-ever.
__label__pos	It's great for calming her down and for long naps.
__label__pos	It dries quickly and easily (I just hang it in the shower).
__label__pos	We're thrilled--and wish we had it from the very first week!
__label__pos	I received this as a Christmas present and my daughter just loves it.
__label__pos	My baby loves every minute of his bath.
__label__neu	I was hoping it would help him sleep longer.
__label__pos	Mom and dad can use it (we actually bought it for grandma who loves to bathe our daughter but has an ackward time doing it in our tub) and then our daughter can use it to brush her teeth or to stand in the kitchen.The maximum weight on this product is 200 pounds so I think its a good product for adults as well who maybe need a little extra help reaching that top shelf in the kitchen!
__label__pos	My baby loves this carrier.
__label__neu	He absolutely detested being smooshed awkwardly up against my chest, so we used an original bjorn carrier for his first few months.
__label__pos	Everyone who has used it loves it because there is no fussing with latches or handgrips.
__label__pos	These bottles are great.
__label__neg	One thing I do wish it has was a little strech between her legs.
__label__pos	This is a good solution.
__label__neu	I also use on on the floor under her activity gym (Sparkling Symphony Gym)since it doesn't include a mat.
__label__pos	I no longer had any pain when I nursed on that side because the nipple shild created a barier, and allowed the nipple to heal.
__label__pos	I can't imagine going through winter without it.
__label__neg	Well, he's now 5 weeks old and this cover won't even last through a 3 hour nap before leaking and soaking his clothes and bedding.
__label__pos	This is a pretty color and the fabric is so soft.
__label__pos	I love these for late night pumping if my child doesn't wake up.
__label__neg	Additionally the case is difficult to carry by the handle (there's no hole) and is not securely closed.
__label__pos	This is must have for every baby.
__label__pos	I washed it a few times and it held up well.
__label__neu	Quick wipe and done!
__label__pos	Aah...The best thing e..v..e..r
__label__pos	The removable cover (zipper) makes this easy to clean (just make sure the velcro is stuck to itself when you wash it or it will stick to all your nice socks.
__label__neu	We use this headrest for their bouncy seats only.
__label__pos	I am sold!!!
__label__pos	It's very easy to use and clean and I love that it attatches to the bottles so I can give it right to my baby or throw it in fridge for later.
__label__neu	No lie.
__label__neu	We have our crib matress dressed in an additional regular crib sheet underneath with a cheap matress pad below it.
__label__pos	You could just use your own cloth or towel but I like this product because it doesn't budge and is not bulky.
__label__pos	It absorbs all baby drool and I don't have to wash the Baby Bjorn after every outing.
__label__pos	This one is really a peach.
__label__pos	There were problems with all the other bottles....such as leaking, having to buy liners all the time, unmarked nipples, suction, etc.
__label__neu	(We wanted the sage color to match our nursery decor.)
__label__neu	He can pick them up, transfer them from hand to hand.
__label__pos	best baby monitor for your money
__label__pos	No leaks though.
__label__pos	It is affordable, which is one of the features that makes it is great (having a baby, especially the 1st one, is expensive enough).You can use the Avent bottles and magic cups interchangably for milk storage, so there are fewer things you have to wash.
__label__pos	It's easy to hold, and the entire thing has good textures for chewing.
__label__pos	so much fun - for me and my wee one
__label__pos	I already had the Orbit system and this stroller seat is great.
__label__pos	This monitor is fine.
__label__pos	(I cleaned and dried it immediately, and never had any problems.)
__label__pos	This gate saved me money...
__label__pos	I only wish I had started using it sooner.
__label__pos	It's a great size and easy to clean.
__label__pos	Both are excellent products  fit the Bob perfectly.
__label__neu	).
__label__pos	I can't wait to put baby in it.
__label__pos	The large handles on the items (especially the clippers and scissors) are very handy so that you don't have to worry about slipping and accidentally cutting your squirming newborn while trying to do those ever-important nail trimmings.
__label__neg	She is average length and it still fits her but is getting small at the armholes.
__label__pos	You don't have to worry about nipple confusion with this bottle if u are using it to give the baby pumped milk while u are at work, have to supplement with formula or anything like that.
__label__neu	I do have to constantly clean her off, however my DD *loves* this little cutie!
__label__pos	Works well as a travel or back-up stroller
__label__neu	Be sure to try at home first!
__label__neu	My only two complaints are that the plug DOES NOT change color when water is too hot.
__label__pos	Works well!
__label__pos	It is very light weight and easy to open and close and would fit easily in any trunk and should still leave room.The baby bargian book that I used when creating my registry and making initial baby purchases recommended that expectant parents purchase an infant seat and and infant seat frame and wait to buy a stroller until baby is older.
__label__neu	When I was pregnant I couldn't understand why these were so popular especially at the cost of $20 each.
__label__neg	The lock is necessary because in this model the odors linger if you don't lock it, hence it is not hands free as it is supposed to be.
__label__neu	Jacques comes complete with a mirror, a squeaker, taggies, lots of textures and colors, and a link so he can tag along.
__label__pos	Now with my son (13 months also averadge size) We have been using this seat for a few months: He has never fallen in to the water and he is more active than she was.
__label__pos	When I put him in his crib, my hope is that he'll fall asleep and this First Years mobile does just that!The remote is also a great feature so I don't have to come into the room while he is about to fall asleep.And finally...I love that this can be used at night!
__label__pos	Wish we had found this months ago!
__label__pos	This carrier is AWESOME!
__label__pos	But once I used it, it made changing the crib in the middle of the night speedy, letting baby and ME get back to sleep quicker.First off, it is soft to lay on, absorbant and waterproof.
__label__pos	The purple color is great and it all comes in a great carrying case complete with an important information magnet that you can stick on the refrigerator for baby sitter's etc.
__label__neu	Love it, but noisy...
__label__neg	Imagine my disappointment when I opened them up at my baby shower... As I pulled them out of the bos, chips of white paint came falling out of the baskets like snow!!!
__label__pos	The heating element is on top, which makes it safer than other models.
__label__pos	Well, now I know I would pay full price for them if I lost the ones I have.
__label__pos	I would recommend this product to others.
__label__neu	I just about a pack of the sealing discs that fit the bottles (in this case Avent because that's what I have).
__label__neu	It is not one of those battery operated toys.
__label__neu	I put this swing together in 15 minutes.
__label__pos	I mastered getting the baby in and out both awake and asleep after a couple of days which is great because he falls asleep in it almost every time.
__label__neu	After some research, we decided to buy the Britax Marathon for our daughter.
__label__neu	The Ventaires didn't fit well on dryer adn would wiggle all around and fall off if it was jiggled in the least.
__label__pos	The co-sleeper was very easy to put together and very simple to attach to our bed.
__label__pos	More interesting to baby than you'd think...
__label__pos	Another problem with this backpack is that the other pocket that is not insulated is very large and deep with netting.
__label__pos	This is a good sheet.
__label__pos	I was able to lay him down on the soft surface and clean him all over without any tears!
__label__pos	She loves to lay down and look at all the colors.
__label__pos	I really feel that this is the best diaper pail on the market.
__label__neg	I gave only 4 stars because it does hold dog hair and lint on the black parts pretty badly.
__label__neg	I like the blanket but the tag says 100% cotton, mentions nothing organic but yet it was listed and sold as an organic blanket.
__label__neg	You can get it much cheaper at your local Target or Walmart, though.
__label__neg	The problem is that the one we received does not shut off automatically at the 23 or 45 minute intervalls.
__label__neg	Now I know that is the batteries,b/c they were a lesser breand then I usually buy, but it just shows how much battery power that it takes.
__label__pos	Since this is the only monitor I have had experience with, I can only rate it based on how it has worked for me.I have been very happy with this monitor.
__label__pos	Its motions are completely irresistible to even the grumpiest sleep-avoider.
__label__pos	this pillow has been my saving grace.
__label__pos	Perfect for little ones
__label__pos	Worth it
__label__pos	She loves it when you spin it around for her and will happily coo at it while being changed.
__label__neu	I use it in a dark brown crib.
__label__neu	Besides, this model doesn't cost any more than the one without a night light.When we are out, obviously my baby gets treated with cold wipes, but at home we always change her in her nursery with warm ones.
__label__neg	Its probably a matter of preference what you like and what you intend to use these multi-purpose cloths for.On the downside, these shrunk slightly more than the other Gerbers, and are now an inch smaller on each side.
__label__pos	She loves the toys that come standard and can't be removed, but she also likes the ones that can be changed.
__label__neg	If they had cost less, I wouldn't have been so disappointed in the quality.
__label__neu	i'm still bf so i dont know how it would go with bottles and fomula, but i'm sure it wont be a problem.
__label__pos	Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.)
__label__pos	It was great!
__label__pos	After breaking several fingernails trying to get outlet covers off, I tried several brands and found this to be the only one that didn't fight me.
__label__pos	Best Seat Ever!
__label__neg	Not practical
__label__pos	Great Pump
__label__pos	Trust me... if you plan on using this to feed your baby, you'll be MUCH happier with this slipcover!!
__label__neu	I figured at that price they were worth a shot.
__label__pos	This kit represents overall good value in terms of the contents, since a single digital thermometer costs ...
__label__pos	The sterilizer works great, simply, and fast!
__label__neu	(I've had it for about two months now.)
__label__neu	He is teething but I think he would like it anyway because it is so easy to grab and squeak!
__label__pos	I wish I found it sooner!
__label__pos	"One of the few ""must haves"" that I really believe in."
__label__pos	It is a lifesaver.
__label__neu	And it slips into the suitcase pocket for storage.
__label__pos	Easy to use.
__label__pos	Teether dream come true
__label__neu	I don't know why other users have had trouble with static or humming--I haven't experienced that at all.
__label__pos	A great buy!
__label__neu	It has lots of adjustment at the neckline.
__label__pos	Grandbaby approved
__label__pos	They're also great for attaching toys to the stroller, car seat, etc.
__label__pos	It's that easy.
__label__pos	Excellent product, Philips!
__label__pos	The music is nice.
__label__pos	great choice
__label__neu	It uses less water, her head is elevated, and she's a little higher.
__label__pos	It seems to fit better than the cheaper chairs, plus, as others note, it is elegant and attractive.
__label__pos	Worth the Extra Money
__label__pos	very comfy
__label__pos	I really liked getting a carseat that matched the print on our stroller.
__label__pos	She pushes the buttons and plays with it all the time.
__label__pos	This item is awesome.
__label__neg	I wish that there were another option in a lighter color and a lightweight fabric for summer.
__label__neu	Just step and nudge.
__label__neg	I guarantee they will break off with little effort.
__label__pos	They are all helpful and can be used until your baby is a toddler.
__label__neu	(Same goes for the matching hamper!
__label__pos	They are easy to sterilize, use and clean.
__label__pos	I've had no issue with dry wipes because I read the directions.
__label__pos	I only need one.
__label__pos	This bottle is specifically designed to help babies latch on better and learn to breastfeed better.
__label__pos	A must have for breastfeeding mothers!
__label__pos	Easy to use - so convenient!
__label__pos	That is all I need.
__label__pos	"From the time I hung it up, at around 7-8 weeks, she was mesmerized by it, and now at 12 weeks she giggles and ""talks"" to the flowers."
__label__neu	They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.
__label__pos	This is a great all purpose blanket.
__label__neg	When my baby was under 4 months old he hated the Ergo.
__label__pos	I would definitely buy this again.
__label__pos	I'm glad I have this warmer!
__label__neu	They slide out easily and never seem to get stuck in the netting.
__label__pos	I would definately recommend this product!
__label__neu	If we used a diaper bag that we had to carry on our shoulder, our shoulders would have been sore.
__label__neu	I got it as a baby-shower gift and have used it until my little one was ready to sleep on her crib at 3 months of age(actually, that's when I was ready to let her go to her crib.. :-).
__label__neg	The static is so loud, you can barely hear the baby.
__label__pos	This is a wonderful toy that is fun, educational, and affordable!
__label__pos	It even tells the temperature in the babies room so we know when it's to cold or hot.
__label__pos	It's so easy to use!!
__label__neu	But because he wouldn't be covered with water, I turned the bathroom heater on 5 mins before bathtime so he wouldn't get cold.
__label__pos	Great tub
__label__pos	GREAT FOR TODDLERS AND EVEN PRESCHOOLER
__label__neu	In my opinion to me it's just as easy to grab a bottle out of the fridge.
__label__neu	I was attracted to the idea of having a bottle warmer that doesn't require electricity or a car adapter.
__label__pos	The entire line works together from breast pumps, to sanitizers, to storage containers, to sippy cups.
__label__neu	Our bed + mattress is pretty high and I needed the extensions to raise the cosleeper to my level.
__label__neg	If you are washing it on warm your water temp may be too high(hot water heater) so that may be causing it to shrink.
__label__pos	Yes, its battery operated but seems to get its money worth and in between my two children we loaned it to four different friends and its still in great condition (removable/washable cover).
__label__neu	MY daughter has been playing with it since she turn one.
__label__pos	Even now, when my 2-year old son sees it sitting in the nursery, he has to sit down and PLAY with it!This is a great, quality product at a great price- WORTH EVERY PENNY!
__label__pos	(The nesting feature is great for storage too).
__label__pos	I think its cute and I like that it plays music.
__label__neu	Whenever the baby outgrows it, the baby is probably ready to sit in the infant seat without extra support.
__label__neu	I like it a lot, but its cumbersome to put on
__label__pos	If I am ever out of range, it signals me, and I reset it and it's good to go... A good buy for the price.
__label__pos	The dual swing action is nice but, my boy only seems to like swinging side to side so, we never really used the front to back motion.
__label__neu	Would recommend this kit but am hoping the fit will be better as my newborn grows.
__label__neu	No doubt this is a great seat, but it isn't made for infants, no matter what the description says.
__label__neu	The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors.
__label__neu	Bummi's whisper wrap is much better, and available on Amazon.
__label__neg	The edge draws strings to tighten him in just do not do the trick.
__label__neu	The bouncing is gentle and natural, spurred by baby's own movements (though you can gently rock baby to sleep, too).
__label__pos	He loves the stuff on the sides and stares at the bright colors.
__label__neu	I just cannot decide about this sling!
__label__pos	This is a fun product!
__label__pos	But now she is 9lb 10oz and is just right for the swing - not to fast.
__label__pos	It is so simple to use and my baby always falls asleep in it (she's 6 weeks old).
__label__neu	I purchase it for my baby.
__label__pos	I also like how there is a built in way to clip the cover to a cord.
__label__neu	Now he hangs out and only cries once I start washing his hair.
__label__pos	I would definitely buy it again.
__label__pos	The Snuzzler is the perfect accessory for an infant car seat, especially for newborns and preemies.
__label__pos	a must have - buy 2!
__label__pos	My son LOVES this carrier, at least facing forward (He wasn't keen on facing inward in any of the carriers).
__label__pos	This infant carrier is great.
__label__neu	Given the choice, I would definitely purchase these over the Graco pack n play sheets which feel rougher and not as soft.
__label__pos	Item arrived in good condition and quite fast.
__label__neu	A Lactation Consultant suggested I pump between each feeding to up my supply, there was no way I could have done that with a manual.
__label__neu	I don't understand the problem in some of the other reviews that the footrest comes unsnapped...
__label__pos	), because I've used these myself a couple times in a pinch when cold or napping, and they're great!
__label__neg	I found it awkward to put together.
__label__neu	We already have a 2 year old son, and he has slept in our bed from birth--hated his crib!
__label__pos	I'm not really sure what the purpose of it is, but I guess it keeps my daughter from opening the buckle herself - not that she has the hand strength necessary.Overall, for the reason I bought this, I am happy.
__label__pos	We have loved it since day 1!!!
__label__pos	Between the Ocean Wonders Swing and this bouncer he is always entertained when we're busy or trying to relax.
__label__pos	The walker although is not as colorful as it seems from the picture but is good enuff to keep my son engaged.
__label__pos	Before i had this pillow i was having restless nights with little or no sleep at all due to suddenly having to accustom myself to sleeping on the sides.Once i received this pillow,not one sleepless night.This pillow is a boon for every pregnant lady.
__label__pos	Love this nightlight!
__label__pos	Now I understand why these are so popular!
__label__neu	I could not get a straight yes or no answer from Kids II who actually manufacture this product.
__label__neg	My only reservation about this carrier is that the color is dark, and the fabric is thick.
__label__neu	She likes to be high up and see everything that's going on around her.
__label__pos	My favorite blankets.
__label__pos	This is the best pack n' play.
__label__pos	SO its a KEEPER!
__label__pos	We didn't start using the toy bar much until she was about 3 1/2 months, but now she loves batting at the toys and watching the lights.
__label__neu	Good luck if you get the bag.
__label__neg	I find that I have trouble getting each bottle to the perfect temperature.
__label__neg	It does leak at the hinges.
__label__pos	so far so good
__label__neu	This was a first baby gift for us and we used in frequently even now with our second baby.
__label__pos	This allows us to make it thru the night without having to make a full crib linen change--- at least until morning.I will certainly buy this as my gift to all my friends baby showers!
__label__pos	Great restraint!
__label__pos	My baby boy is just beginning to understand cause and effect and this seems to help a little (crinkle the head, make a sound, get a smile.
__label__neu	I used it in the airports, malls.
__label__pos	"We use a new washcloth at each bathing so this is really all we need to hold.What I liked most about this product was that it ""grows"" with your child so they can use it as a stepstool as they get older."
__label__neu	Not at all.
__label__pos	Keeps wipes pretty moist.
__label__pos	Originally I wanted one of the more decorative hampers but I am glad I went with this one.
__label__neu	I breastfeed my baby with it every time, unless we're out somewhere.
__label__neu	A place to sit!
__label__neu	I bought my son the pack n' play in rise n' shine with a bassinet.
__label__neu	The only thing is, the small one I Had was in fleece, and my baby is a warm baby so he would get hot.
__label__neg	"One downfall - have plenty of size ""D"" batteries handy."
__label__pos	Definitely worth getting!
__label__pos	Our son's gas IMMEDIATELY disappeared and he no longer suffered from nipple confusion.
__label__neu	My mom got this tub for my daughter right after she was born.
__label__neu	Also purchased an additional camera, so that I could monitor both of the children's rooms.
__label__pos	She's been using it for about a month so far, and hasn't grown tired of it yet.
__label__pos	This one is good because you can wash the cover, which I've had to do.
__label__pos	Beats the Genie Hands Down!
__label__neu	I bought this when our son was 2 1/2 months old.
__label__neu	(You can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby.)
__label__pos	It's very snuggly for him and is so easy to put in/take out of the car seat as well as wash.
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	It was very easy to put together me and my 4yr old did it.
__label__pos	There is no odor and it is very easy to use.
__label__pos	It's worth it!
__label__pos	Great for little hands
__label__pos	My baby wanted to bounce more than my arms could accommodate and this was the solution.
__label__pos	With just a simple adustment to the strap I can change it to wrap her around me.
__label__pos	Must have for ANY parent who likes to go out!
__label__neu	Also, the dirty wheels will tend to make the sun visor dirty since they are in contact when folded.The buckle seems to work well although there is a velcro cover that folds over the buckle assembly from the outside in.
__label__pos	This is awesome because there isn't much time for working around the house with a new baby.This pump also stores quite well in the Avent microwave steam sterilizer.
__label__pos	Absolutely GREAT!
__label__pos	I see you can get up to XL so I guess I will be using these for a while!
__label__neu	You, obviously need to at least rinse the bottles and nipples before putting them in.
__label__pos	A friend of mine uses different ones that only had two different flows and was envious of my choices!GROW WITH ME- The fact that the whole set is interchangeable is great.
__label__neg	Plus, I find that in the dishwasher little bits of food and guck get stuck in them, especially the nipples.
__label__neu	i only really used the two brushes rather than the finger brush.
__label__pos	Easily secures to almost any chair.
__label__neu	In fact, in the photo on the box it came in, that is exactly what they show it being used with.
__label__pos	She's got beautiful eyes, a neat ring with little bugs to jiggle around and a handful of fun, crinkley flowers.
__label__pos	It has many options to keep babies entertained when you need to get house work done, dinner cooked or just go to the bathroom.My husband is currently deployed so I spend a lot of time traveling in between my family's houses.
__label__neu	Since we bought the dekor plus it is bigger, but since the smell keeps getting out we have never even allowed more than a day's diapers -5- to stay in there.
__label__pos	Don't get anything else!
__label__pos	It is high enough for a young toddler to reach the toilet (though it could be just a bit higher for really young ones like 18mo) and the rails make toddlers feel *so* secure.
__label__pos	a must have
__label__neu	Just pour whatever amount of water in it tells you, drop your bottle in and press the button.
__label__pos	She seemed so much more comfortable than in the hard plastic bathtub, and much more stable as well.
__label__neg	For such an expensive cover, I expected a LOT more.
__label__pos	She loves it.
__label__neu	I went through at least three or four other front carriers, trying in vain to save myself from spending BIG BUCKS on the BABY BJORN carriers.
__label__pos	I would not live without them!
__label__pos	"He does in fact like to be swaddled  basic 36""x36"" cotton flannel receiving blankets work much better for us.I will say this swaddler is easier to wrap than a blanket."
__label__neg	I don't use it in their car seats because the smaller part of the head rest only fit their heads for a few weeks and the bigger part is to big for them now.
__label__neu	I registered for this product because I have a small house and didn't have a good place to store a full-sized baby tub.
__label__neu	My daughter had to have rice cereal added to her formula and these nipples are clearly marked Stage 1 (Slow flow, formula only for infants) and Stage 2 (Fast flow, for cereal and/or older babies).
__label__pos	Great entertainer!
__label__pos	this is a great buy.
__label__neu	Previously, we had a cheap wood, stationary gate in our hallway.
__label__pos	I love this stroller seat.
__label__pos	Washes well and never shrunk for me.
__label__pos	Overall another great product made by Fisher Price.
__label__neg	Don't Start with a Starter Set!
__label__neu	I bought these for my daughter because she found her feet, and I figured since she was always playing with them I would get her something to put on her feet to play with.
__label__pos	I would recommend buying a pack even if you don't think you'll need them because I guarantee they will be put to good use.
__label__neu	Great product overall, BUT...
__label__neu	And I do wish they made handles to attach so it would be easier for my boys to learn to hold their bottles.These are still by far my boys favorite bottle.
__label__neu	Finally!
__label__pos	With the exception of the KidKraft, I wasted my money on everything.This stool is worth every penny when compared to safety issues of all the other stools.
__label__neu	Some stars show on the wall and some on the ceiling.
__label__pos	A MUST have!
__label__pos	These came out the winner in my book, mostly because even without the assistance of fabric softener, there came out far softer than the premium prefolds.
__label__neu	We used avent, Playtex Ventaire adn Dr. Brown's with our daughter.
__label__pos	PERFECT
__label__neu	My wife has the large Bugaboo she uses all the time, but I needed a stroller for our one year old to keep in the trunk of my convertible (BMW M3).
__label__pos	This monitor is great.
__label__neu	When I first got Sophie in the mail, I had some buyers remorse because it did seem like a glorified dog toy.
__label__neu	!
__label__neu	However, we switched to Dr. Brown's when our son began suffering from gas and nipple confusion, since I am nursing.
__label__neg	You get scared to run the batteries down b/c there are so many to replace and hard to get in and out.
__label__neg	OK DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU HATE NOISES.
__label__pos	Besides using it as a nursing cover up I used it as a sun shade all the time.
__label__pos	The color scheme is warm and the design of the animals goes well in a baby's room.
__label__neu	I purchased this product for much cheaper from diapers.com.
__label__pos	Great toy for little babies
__label__pos	It is very safe as it comes with a kickstand to prevent falling forward.
__label__pos	The best thing that could help an expectant mother especially during the nights when your sleeping postures are no longer comfortable.
__label__pos	BY FAR THE BEST BABY ITEM!!
__label__neu	One thing I did notice was that after I put it together, my 2yr old daughter happened to be watching, she immediately knew how to open the gate!
__label__neu	Entertaining but a Pain to Put Together
__label__neu	Infant Carseat-Graco Snugride
__label__pos	Best Swing Available
__label__neg	I had problem putting them together, no way, my baby could succeed.
__label__neu	I have also never used the cooler.
__label__neg	I primarily breastfeed and the shape of these nipples are nothing like mine.
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	A great product!
__label__neg	However, the stage 1 nipple was way too fast for my baby, and it caused her to spit up nearly everything I had just fed her at every single feeding!
__label__pos	Also, it is a lot bigger than most of the other pack n' plays and will come in really handy for holding toys when my son gets a little older.
__label__pos	The only tub to buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__pos	I bought it to use with my daughter, and I love it.
__label__pos	Great Diaper Pail
__label__neu	At least with the harness they get to walk and explore and get some exercise.
__label__neu	I rented the hospital (medela) pump for the first month until I was sure I could get my supply up and breastfeed (registering for it was too much pressure!). 
__label__pos	This pump is great, my baby girl is 7 months old and I'm still pumping away for milk in her cereal. 
__label__pos	I have the backpack, good to travel with but I think I would have gotten the carry bag had I seen it first. 
__label__neu	I've heard also that the Original is better than the Advanced. 
__label__pos	Glad I went with Original. 
__label__pos	Definitely recommend.
__label__neg	This bowls are worthless. 
__label__neg	The suction cups do not work. 
__label__neu	I've tried everything. 
__label__neg	I make sure the surface is super clean, I add a little bit of water to try to create a greater suction, no luck. 
__label__neu	My 16 month old daughter pulls them up with ease. 
__label__neg	The bowls are a good size, but if you're looking for something to stay put, these are not a good buy.
__label__pos	I love this monitor.  
__label__neu	When my son is in bed, I will play music for him.  
__label__pos	I can turn it down low so I can barely hear the music.  
__label__pos	When my son fusses or moves I can can hear him crystal clear over the music.  
__label__pos	It is great.
__label__neg	I do get interference every once in a while.  
__label__neu	It will beep and the range alarm will light up.  
__label__neu	It can be annoying, but it doesn't happen often.
__label__pos	"My daughter got this for her ""shower"" and she absolutely loved it.  "
__label__pos	She would lie mesmerized by the musical star and also loved playing with, reaching for, grabbing, and eventually even taking off all the things that hang from the various loops.  
__label__pos	It's got great colors and shapes and overall is just terrific.  
__label__pos	This is a great great item - one of the best we've found.
__label__neu	At about 7-8 months, the thrill wore off.  
__label__neu	Now she crawls over/through it and moves on.
__label__pos	: )
__label__pos	This is a really great product for the carseat, shopping cart, stroller, etc.  
__label__neu	Basically, anywhere a sippy cup will be tossed.  
__label__pos	It has a good rubber grip, adjustable length, sturdy design and material.  
__label__neg	I just think it's a little pricey for the product.  
__label__pos	Otherwise, highly recommended!
__label__pos	For what I paid I am satisfied with this little hamper.  
__label__pos	It is very easy to clean and goes wonderfully with the rest of the decor in my child's bathroom.  
__label__pos	"I do believe that, ""you get what you pay for"" so I do not expect this hamper to last years and years but for now it serves it's purpose and is very cute.  "
__label__neu	When searching for hampers with a monkey theme there are not many choices to choose from.  
__label__pos	I am very happy with this purchase.
__label__pos	I use this sheet for my baby's arm's reach co-sleeper; it fits perfectly and doesn't bunch up at all. 
__label__pos	It is soft, thick and washes very well. 
__label__neu	The original arm's reach sheets are thin and rough...
__label__pos	for the same price or less, the Eddie Bauer sheets are such a steal! 
__label__neu	For those worrying about the quilted quality of the sheets and baby's safety, I use a sleep positioner for peace of mind.
__label__pos	This is a great bed.  
__label__pos	Very convenient to travel with compared to a portable play yard. 
__label__pos	Also very easy to put up and take down. 
__label__neg	HOWEVER the zipper on our case broke after two uses (we never forced the bed into the case).  
__label__neu	I have called customer service two times, and they have agreed to send a new case, but three weeks later I have not received the case.  
__label__neu	Another call and another promise to send a case.  
__label__neu	Maybe we just had bad luck, but the bed itself is wonderful.  
__label__neg	Just frustrating that the travel case isn't holding up.
__label__pos	These are great for little ones, Once my daughter got a little older she became attached to her blanket and had to sleep with it, by that time she could roll over, etc. 
__label__neu	so we weren't as worried about her sleeping with it.  
__label__neu	When she got older she didn't want her feet confined, but when she was little, these were great for cold winters.
__label__pos	I think these baskets are great.  
__label__neu	I have 4 of them stocked on my changing table.  
__label__neu	I have them filled with diapers, receiving blankets, bibs, burp cloths, bath supplies, etc.  
__label__pos	All of it is easily accessible and they look adorable.  
__label__neu	I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 only because the first set that I bought I had to fix.  
__label__neu	Be careful with the ties on the liners.  
__label__neg	The ties on one of mine broke as I was trying to tie the bow.  
__label__neu	Our Babies R Us hardly ever has them in stock so instead of returning it and waiting for more to come in, I had to restring the tie through the liner and sew it back together.  
__label__neu	A little bit of work but I am still happy with my purchase overall.
__label__pos	"Liked that this changing pad had a ""well"" so our baby could less-easily roll herself off, although we always keep a hand on her, even when she was supertiny. "
__label__pos	Holding up well after several months of daily use; looks brand-new. 
__label__pos	Cushy enough to plop your baby down and not have her feel what's underneath -- which in our case is an IKEA dresser. 
__label__neu	Throw a Big Dot waterproof cover over this (see reviews for that, does double duty as a mattress pad too) and you're set.
__label__pos	When we first brought our baby boy home, my wife bought this Boppy Nursing Pillow and got good use out of it for about the first month. 
__label__pos	I also used it when I bottle fed the little tike and it worked rather well. 
__label__pos	It was comfortable for both me and the baby. 
__label__neu	"Then a friend of hers told her that the ""My Brest Friend"" nursing pillow was much better. "
__label__neu	Far superior! My wife tried it out and, sure enough, agreed. 
__label__neu	One Boppy Nursing Pillow became surplus, although I continued using it for bottle-feeding the baby for the next six months, I might add. 
__label__pos	We both appreciated the removable cover as we could easily freshen it up now and then.
__label__neu	Gary Peterson
__label__neu	Got this just for its dual purpose of being able to use on a regular toilet and on the go.  
__label__pos	It is nice that it is small and portable but it is really tiny when you get it on a toilet.  
__label__neu	It looks more ring like than seat like.  
__label__neu	This is especially true if you have an elongated toilet bowl.  
__label__neg	And if you have an elongated bowl the seat actually ends up sitting towards the back making it a little hard for the kid to climb on to.  
__label__neg	"The worst part for boys is that if you/they are not careful the design tends to allow ""sprayage"" all over the place as there isn't much room between the kids ""junk"" and the front of the bowl.  "
__label__neu	Have the Bjorn seat in another bathroom that works really well.  
__label__pos	Will likely get another for home and keep this one in the care for outings only.
__label__neu	1. 
__label__pos	The ultra light version of the Joovy is so worth the extra cost...
__label__pos	don't think about it, just get this one.
__label__neu	2.  
__label__pos	Great great stroller after having a couple of crummy ones (and one good one, but that was big and bulky).  
__label__pos	Have used it for about 1.5 years and VERY happy that we bought it.  
__label__pos	Wish we had bought it sooner.
__label__neu	3.  
__label__pos	"This is one of those purchases where I was initially thinking ""wow that's expensive!  "
__label__neu	"Is it going to be worth the premium cost?"""
__label__neu	Contrary to my normal self, I relented and not only bought the Joovy, but this ultralight version.  
__label__pos	The answer is yes, a thousand times yes, it's worth it.  
__label__pos	So easy to fold, throw in the back of the car, and go.
__label__pos	Highly recommended.
__label__pos	i have tried many sippy cups with my now 3 year old and none have compared to this one. 
__label__neu	this one does not have the valves that you have to take out to clean then put back in. 
__label__neu	its two pieces; one cup, one top. 
__label__pos	after finding these i will not be using any other type of sippy cup for my 7 mo. 
__label__pos	i just wish i could've found these earlier. 
__label__pos	i have yet to see even a tiny drip come from these. 
__label__pos	many others let out a drip or two when tipped over and such, but not these. 
__label__pos	i LOVE the design on these also. 
__label__pos	doesn't get much cooler than this. 
__label__neu	i use them for my daughter as well as my son. 
__label__neu	ive had many people comment on them.
__label__neu	Before my first child was born, I was all set to buy the Diaper Genie but then a friend told me about the Diaper Champ. 
__label__pos	She said that it did a good job and I didn't have to buy any special bags. 
__label__neu	So I went out and bought it along with a big box of tall kitchen bags. 
__label__pos	My son is now 4 months old, and so far it is working great. 
__label__pos	It is in the nursery and there is no smell at all. 
__label__pos	I am usually very sensitive about any bad smells, and so is my mom but even she couldnt smell any odors. 
__label__pos	So far this has been a great product. 
__label__neu	The lid is definately tight, but it does not bother me much. 
__label__neu	Hopefully, it will still work when the diapers get REALLY smelly! 
__label__pos	But so far so good!!
__label__neg	Don't waste your time with this version.  
__label__neu	The older one can be found in most children's consignment stores and is much better.  
__label__neu	I also have the Flutterbye version, which is even better.
__label__pos	These are my favorite bottles for my little guy.  
__label__pos	They hold enough liquid and they are easy to handle for both of us.  
__label__neg	The only draw back is they do have a lot of pieces with six parts as compared to most bottles four.  
__label__pos	We do notice less burping when using these as compared to others.
__label__neg	We have noticed that with repeated washing these bottles don't hold ink very well so we have to put the names back on the bottles about once a week for the daycare.  
__label__pos	Haven't had any issues with the pre-printed labels on the bottles though.
__label__neg	Four stars just because of the extra parts to wash!
__label__neu	I breastfed and formula fed my baby for the first 5 weeks. 
__label__pos	My baby did not fuss at all when I offered her these type of nipples (compared to the breast).  
__label__neu	I also tried the Dr. 
__label__neu	Brown's, Gerber and Evenflo and she did not like them at all.  
__label__neu	I think because the base of the nipple was not as big as the Playtex nipples.  
__label__pos	Anyhow, it is very convenient for at home use.  
__label__neg	It is not convenient when you are out and about.  
__label__neu	You still need to have some type of regular bottle.  
__label__neg	I found that out the hard way.  
__label__neg	Something in my diaper bag punctured the plastic liner and the formula got all over my brand new diaper bag.  
__label__neu	I suggest the Playtex ventair system for a regular bottle because it has the same basic nipple shape. 
__label__pos	Overall I think Playtex has the best bottles and nipples.
__label__neu	We had a plastic mat underneath our high chair for the first two years for our daughter...  
__label__neu	It was very useful, the only downside being that it wasn't that attractive and things sometimes got under it.  
__label__neu	All in all it was fine and we replaced it because it was getting worn out, and we thought we would get something more attractive and fun.
__label__neg	Enter the Splashmat - we put it under the high chair and gave it a go - but we expected it to be a little tougher and thicker so that we could move a chair on it without it bunching up, and that it would stay flat.  
__label__neg	It does not stay flat -  Every time we pull the chair in and out it bunches up and wrinkles.  
__label__neg	Though we can straighten it out, it requires constant attention and re-laying.  
__label__neg	Not what we needed, and we have stopped using it and folded it away to use for picnics or as a beach throw, we guess.  
__label__neu	It's pretty and probably would be good for that, but fails as a under table mat to keep things clean.
__label__pos	My baby loves this bouncer.  
__label__neu	We used it when she was just born to sit her in while we were eating.  
__label__pos	The vibrator feature produces a nice calming effect.  
__label__pos	"Now she is old enough to really enjoy the lights and noises that she can produce with her feet and ""sings"" to the variety of songs that it plays.  "
__label__pos	I think it's nice that there are a bunch of songs that it plays so you don't have to listen to the same thing over and over!  
__label__pos	It's brightly colored and easy to assemble.
__label__pos	I like this pack n play. 
__label__pos	The changing table is fine. 
__label__neu	Another review mentioned that it tilts and her baby rolls. 
__label__neg	Mine tilts a bit as well, but we've gotten better at adjusting the baby so he's not rolling around. 
__label__pos	This pack n play was easy to put together.
__label__neu	I got this one because I liked the napper concept. 
__label__neg	However, I was under the impression that you could detach the napper and use it elsewhere. 
__label__neg	That is not the case. 
__label__neg	"The napper ""hangs"" inside the pack-n-play, so if you take it off and lay it on the floor, it loses its shape. "
__label__neu	This is the only reason I gave this product 4 stars, not 5. 
__label__neg	It would have been nice if you could take the napper off and use it somewhere else. 
__label__pos	That aside, the pack n play is great. 
__label__pos	My newborn loved the napper, and we removed it at about 5 weeks to allow him to sleep on the flat surface of the bassinet insert.
__label__pos	My one year old son and I share a shower/bathtub. 
__label__neu	The older he gets, the more bath toys he seem to acquire! 
__label__neu	Well, after finally getting frustrated with lining them up along the edge of the tub, I found this little cubby at Wal-mart one day. 
__label__neu	I wasn't expecting much, but it was something for the time being, till I could find something I felt would be sturdier. 
__label__pos	Fortunately, there's no need!
__label__pos	I've had this for about 2 months now, and it has never, not once, fallen down. 
__label__neu	I have your average, fiberglass shower/tub, and this thing is FILLED with bath toys. 
__label__pos	I guess it depends on what type of tub you have, but this was a great find for me. 
__label__pos	I absolutely recommend it.
__label__pos	My 18 month old still loves this thing.  
__label__neu	She naws on this thing like crazy.  
__label__pos	It's especially soothing when you put it in the fridge for a while first.
__label__neu	I RECEIVED THIS SWING AS A BABY SHOWER GIFT. 
__label__pos	IT IS TERRIFIC FOR LUGGING AROUND THE HOUSE AND TO GRANDMA'S TOO!
__label__pos	MY DAUGHTER LIKES TO REACH AND GRAB THE HANGING FISH. 
__label__neu	THE MUSIC IS SOOTHING BUT I WISH IT PLAYED LONGER THAN IT DOES. 
__label__pos	OTHER THAN THAT A MUST HAVE PRODUCT.
__label__pos	Very cheap and durable. 
__label__pos	Fun to look at. 
__label__neu	Built in teether. 
__label__pos	My 2 year old likes it too.
__label__neu	We bought this gate, primarily, to keep the dog and cats out of the baby room.  
__label__pos	My husband mounted this to the door frame and adjusted the gate to fit the door, no problem.  
__label__pos	It works wonderfully.  
__label__neu	The dog can sit outside the room and see in and that cats want nothing to do with it.  
__label__pos	The door is secure and safe.  
__label__pos	I don't have to worry about our little one climbing it because there are no foot holds, just clear plastic.  
__label__pos	It opens easily and closes in such a way that is easy for my husband and me but I know that our daughter won't be able to work it open.
__label__pos	This monitor is FANTASTIC!  
__label__neu	And the screen is bigger than some others.  
__label__pos	Quality is great and after using this for 6 months, I would certainly buy it again if I were doing it over.  
__label__pos	The video monitor saves alot of trips upstairs to check on the baby in the middle of the night - the extra sleep I get in my own bed makes this worth every penny!
__label__neu	I received this swing as a shower gift. 
__label__pos	My son was born weighing about 5.5 pounds so we put a neck supports in the swing he seemed to love it lulled him to sleep and the swing is easy to store. 
__label__neg	I was ready to give it a 5 star review until today. 
__label__neu	He is now 6 weeks old and weighs a little over 9 pounds, he can't hold his head up for extended periods of time and he isn't incredible active. 
__label__neu	He was napping in the swing while I did dishes, I heard him make a little noise so I turned around...
__label__neg	much to my horror he was hanging sideways out of the swing! 
__label__neu	He was buckled in, and I was using one of those head support things. 
__label__neg	I feel that this is a safety issue, if you have this swing or get this swing please don't ever take your eyes off of your baby, I was in the same room just with my back to him. 
__label__neu	Luckily my baby was fine I was more shaken up that he was in fact he was still asleep. 
__label__neg	I have read other reviews and I know other people have had the same problem. 
__label__neu	** This is the first and (at this time) the only review I have written
__label__neu	I bought this swing through Amazon.com about 4 months ago. 
__label__neu	It came in quickly and at a very discounted price compared to other retailers. 
__label__neg	The only issue I had with the swing is the switch on the right side of the motor that controls the butterfly light between the battery and a/c plug setting. 
__label__neu	This difference is that the lights turn off in about 15 minutes under the battery and stay on constantly under the a/c. 
__label__neg	The switch will not work most of the time on the a/c power and I can only get the light to turn on under the battery setting side. 
__label__neu	I called fisher-price about the problem and they sent me a new motor. 
__label__neu	I received it in about 4 days after calling. 
__label__neg	The 2nd motor does the same thing. 
__label__pos	I have had no problem with the motor itself so far. 
__label__neu	When there is a heavier baby in the swing you have to run it on high to get it to swing at all, but with my 2 week old daughter in it, it swings fine on the lower settings. 
__label__neu	Luckily if the motor does go out for me, I have the old one that still works too.
__label__neu	I had orignally registered for the 4 in 1 bath station.  
__label__neu	Then I read the reviews of injurys cause by them.  
__label__neu	Plus, my own cousin said it hurt her daughter as well....
__label__neu	Then I read the reviews and switched to this tub.  
__label__pos	My son and I love it.  
__label__pos	The hammock makes it so easy to wash my 2 month old.  
__label__pos	His body is supported so I rest his head on my arm.  
__label__neu	I don't have to hold him up until I have to wash his back area.  
__label__pos	He has fun kicking and pushing off of the front of the tub.
__label__pos	It fits nicely in the kitchen sink as well.
__label__pos	Love it!
__label__neu	You can't 'see' this product's actual size by just looking at a photo. 
__label__neu	It is quite large. 
__label__neg	It also doesn't hold the Playtex Drop-Ins bottles like I hoped it would.
__label__neu	But this company is wonderful. 
__label__pos	The product is sturdy and the design is certainly a wonderful conversation piece. 
__label__pos	Honestly, if I wanted to just store bottles, I would have bought something else!
__label__pos	This playmat has become one of several baby items I couldn't live without! 
__label__pos	We received this one for our baby shower along with a Fischer Price mat, and our son LOVES the Baby Einstein mat and shows little interest in the other one.
__label__neu	First, up to about 4 weeks of age, he would lay under it in the 'on' mode - meaning the star played music and lights for about 5 mintues. 
__label__pos	He would love to stare at it and the toys hanging above him. 
__label__neg	The only down side is the music and lights didn't last too long and we had to keep reactivating it.
__label__neu	Once he was about 4-5 weeks old, we switched to using the 'motion' mode, meaning he had to hit or kick the toys or bars to get the music and lights to play. 
__label__neu	We lowered the toys with the extra  lincs so they would be within him reach. 
__label__pos	It's really helping his motor skills develop and he has so much fun. 
__label__pos	The first time he smiled and laughed was when he was on the mat. 
__label__neu	He really gets his hands and feet moving to get it activated. 
__label__pos	It entertains him long enough for me to get a shower, dress and dry my hair.
__label__neg	The only down side is that it's not very intersting to him for tummy time because he can't pick his head up very far yet. 
__label__pos	Still, I wouldn't want to go a day without it!
__label__pos	I love this sterlizer. 
__label__pos	It will fit anything that needs to be sterilized, including breast pump accessories. 
__label__pos	The wattage is simple to use, just look inside your microwave on the bottom with all the info and it tells you what wattage it is and them refer to the manual to see the time. 
__label__pos	Highly reccomended
__label__pos	We loved this swing. 
__label__neu	My daughted fit in it from the time she was born and we can still use it now at 7 months. 
__label__pos	We haven't had any problems.
__label__neu	I wrote a review a few months ago but I have to edit it. 
__label__neg	I followed all the directions, I was very careful and patient with this tub, I washed it and dried it after each use and still I find things growing in the crevices and between the top and bottom. 
__label__neu	The design idea was good but it just isn't practical for a baby tub that will need to be used regularly. 
__label__neg	The sling slips out of place all the time and the bath ring isn't worth the extra work it takes to clean it and the little ridges that hold it into the tub. 
__label__neg	No matter how hard I work it's impossible to keep this tub clean.
__label__pos	This is by far the best thing I have seen out there yet. 
__label__neu	First, I have read and tried a lot of the other items out there- the foam mats, slings, tubs.... 
__label__neu	I bought the euro tub and it may in the future be a good thing but not right now...
__label__neu	The Safer Bather works like a contoured pillow/sponge. 
__label__neu	It will support baby on a slight incline and will keep her from rolling off either side or down. 
__label__pos	It was the most perfect thing to use when our daughter's belly button had not yet healed.
__label__pos	Our daughter loved being placed on it when the warm water would press thru with her weight on the cushion. 
__label__pos	It also dries very very quickly and can hand up in your shower.
__label__pos	I have even used it in our sink and it supports her perfectly!
__label__pos	With all the others out there to choose from, this one is the best way to spend your $!
__label__neu	I purchased this tub after reading all the online reviews of all the other tubs.  
__label__pos	I am happy with the purchase.  
__label__neu	Up until my daughter was 2 months old, I used the infant insert that comes with the tub to hold her.  
__label__neg	She didn't like it very much and acted as if she felt like she was going to fall or something.  
__label__neu	I finally just removed it and I use the toddler tub itself.  
__label__pos	She likes that much better.  
__label__pos	She is 2 1/2 months now, and she fits just fine in the tub.  
__label__neu	Bath time is still a trying time for us, but at least I knwo that she is safe in the tub.  
__label__neu	It has a plug on the right had side to help it drain.  
__label__neg	If you rely on that, it will take forever to drain.  
__label__neu	I just turn it upside down and empty it out.
__label__neu	We recently bought this pad for our changing table in the blue color. 
__label__pos	It's very soft and fits well with our pad, which was made by another company. 
__label__neg	Another viewer was right about the lack of slits to pull the straps through to hold the baby. 
__label__neu	However, our son isn't extremely squirmy so we don't use the straps anyways. 
__label__neg	He hates it more if we use them and he's more still if we don't. 
__label__pos	Overall, we like this cover, especially for it's cost.
__label__pos	I really like this monitor. 
__label__pos	It works and there is not any feedback and we're in a small place. 
__label__pos	I also like the ability to use the batteries and put it on your belt. 
__label__neu	We use it if we go take the dog out or to do yard work while she's sleeping. 
__label__pos	I would recommend this.
__label__neu	I bought it. 
__label__neg	I used it for several times but i didnt like it.
__label__neu	the edge of shield is firm. 
__label__neg	it doesnt fit the breast. 
__label__neg	and milk leaks out, so you have to hold it with hand with a tissue. 
__label__neg	after a month shield began to loose its shape.
__label__neg	then it sucks really hard. 
__label__neg	my poor nipples were purple even after few minutes of pumping.
__label__neu	Then i bought electrical one. 
__label__neu	MiPump by First years. 
__label__neu	It costs twice the price of this pump, but it sucks really gentle but strong enough (you can adjust the strength of pumping) with a sort of vibration. 
__label__neu	and it feels about the same way as a baby sucking. 
__label__neu	it is electrical and works both from batteries and electricity. 
__label__neu	and pumps 2 breasts at one time.
__label__neu	shields are very soft. 
__label__neu	and i just enjoy pumping now.
__label__neg	Medela is a cool brand, i liked the cream for nipples by Medela and some other products but i am ready to throw this pump away in a dumpster.
__label__neu	This was fine for the first couple weeks, then I realized that it actually didn't do much help.  
__label__neg	Sometimes it would slide up or down and just wasn't long enough for him (and my guy is a short guy!).  
__label__neu	I then just used the trick that they did in the hospital and rolled up a couple of baby blankets and placed one on each side of him.  
__label__pos	Worked perfect!
__label__neu	I REALLY AM HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT EXCEPT HAVING TO PUT THE COVER BACK ON IT AFTER WASHING. 
__label__neg	IT IS DIFFICULT TO STUFF THE FOAM INTO IT. 
__label__neu	I AM GOING TO TRY THE OTHER REVIEWER'S SUGGESTION ABOUT PUTTING THE SHEET OVER THE FOAM INSTEAD.
__label__neu	I have this on the side of our Jenny Lind dressing table.  
__label__pos	I fit two rows of stacked newborn pampers swaddlers diapers in it (with the fold facing out), and they dispense just fine.  
__label__pos	There is plenty of room to fit everything I need to use at the changing table in the side pockets... 
__label__neu	and I use the Dex Wipe Warmer with changing light in the area of the wipe holder.  
__label__neu	It is a little bigger than the space alloted, but I find that the rubber non-skid bumps on the bottom of the warmer hold it within the wipes space... 
__label__pos	and since it is raised above the depot's wipes space it leaves room for any extra wipes that didn't fit inside the warmer.  
__label__pos	This was a great buy, and I don't know what I would have done without it.  
__label__pos	Everything is at a hands reach when I am changing my daugher (6 weeks old now) and I literally can hold her with one hand and reach everything with the other because of this.
__label__neu	i like the tub but my daughters hiney slides too much when i try to put her in the infant side.  
__label__pos	the hamock is wonderful and i use it more than just the tub.  
__label__neg	but when i put her in the infant side, she slides down.  
__label__neu	they should have put one of those pads they have on the back part on the bottom also
__label__neu	The number one important feature of any car seat should be the SAFETY RATING!  
__label__pos	"We checked Consumer Reports before buying our car seat and this car seat was the ONLY convertible car seat that was rated ""excellent"" for crash protection.  "
__label__pos	Safer than Britax, Graco, First Years, Combi, etc.  
__label__neu	I was quite surprised that it was rated so safe considering the fact that it really is a bare bones car seat.  
__label__neu	It's not very soft & cushiony (but hey, neither is our daughter's papasan swing and she's been napping comfortably in that thing for 7 months!
__label__neg	) and it was a little more difficult to install than the car seat that we're using in our other car (the Combi Coccoro).  
__label__pos	But seriously, who cares, it's all about safety and this car seat is safe.  
__label__neu	Just make sure when you're installing it backwards to keep the level line horizontal and it will help you install easier; if the line's not level the seat will be moving around way too much.
__label__pos	Our 4 month old LOVES this toy.  
__label__pos	The bright colors and various textures are awesome!  
__label__neu	Our daughter likes to grab the rings in her hand and shake the whole doll.  
__label__pos	She giggles like mad!  
__label__neg	The only thing I would change - make the hook removeable.  
__label__neg	We don't really need to attach it to anything, and the plastic hook is HARD!  
__label__neg	Our little whacked herself in the face with it once when she shook it and it scared the daylights out of her!  
__label__pos	After that, I cut the hook off and now it's perfect!  
__label__pos	It's entertaining for our daughter, inexpensive, and well made.  
__label__neu	Love it, but I suggest cutting the hook off.  
__label__pos	:-)
__label__pos	This bath is a lifesaver, it fits over our sink beautifully and is really sturdy and a great design, well worth the money and very pleased with it.  
__label__neu	I'm not really fussed about the plug as I didn't buy the bath to tell me when the water was too hot or not, any mother will know and check the temp of water before putting her baby in, and although you may seem wary once you're there doing it you'll know what I mean!  
__label__neu	So for me whether the plug changes color or not is no biggie, I am always making sure the temp is fine anyway.
__label__neu	I like the idea of warm wipes for baby...
__label__neg	but I was very disappointed with this product.  
__label__neg	First of all, the dispenser is useless.  
__label__neg	We got so frustrated trying to get the wipes to dispense properly out of the top that we just gave up and opened the whole unit to get to them during changes.  
__label__neg	Second, the wipes are cold again about a second after you remove them from the container.  
__label__neg	I think this is defintely one of those products that you can do without.
__label__pos	We have now just unplugged the thing and use it as an attractive wipes holder!
__label__pos	I have a toddler & a nb that I carry in the Moby all the time! 
__label__pos	It is very comfortable, easy to put on, & I feel like the baby is secure, all the while I can manage my toddler easily! 
__label__pos	I can even pick my toddler up while the baby is in the wrap...
__label__pos	and the baby loves it!! 
__label__pos	It looks a little intimidating at first, but once you put it on, it doesn't get any better than that!!
__label__pos	This stroller is perfect for anyone who has an infant and a toddler. 
__label__neu	My daughter is 3 and she likes to walk when we are out, but there are times when she wants to sit or when it just isnt safe for her to do it. 
__label__pos	With this stroller - she jumps right on for the ride through the parking lot, or sits when she has had enough walking. 
__label__pos	Also - I still had my Graco infant seat from my daughter, so I was able to use it for my newborn because this stroller will hold just about any carseat out there - safely I must add. 
__label__pos	It makes turns well and is easy to fold up and pick up - it is a bit long with the carseat attatchment on it, but I havent had a problem with it-  it is easy to remove and put back on and at 6 months- baby can sit in stroller seat. 
__label__neu	I constantly get comments and questions about this stroller when I am out. 
__label__pos	So pleased with this stroller!!!!
__label__neu	I use this one in the den.  
__label__neg	It tends to show dirt quickly so it gets washed a lot.  
__label__neu	My little girls is old enough now she notices the little pea pod on the front.  
__label__pos	She likes it and so do I!
__label__pos	My car sits in the hot sun all day at the train station, but the car seat is kept cool thanks to this shade.  
__label__pos	Easy to use - the elastic makes it easy to tuck around the seat.
__label__neu	I am a huge fan of the Lamaze plush toys.  
__label__pos	We own 4 and I will probably be buying more of them.  
__label__pos	I love the colors and patterns and the crinkle ears.  
__label__pos	The toys are just so interactive for babies.
__label__pos	This dog is the first toy to make my son giggle.  
__label__pos	I was playing with him last night and he was excited to see pupsqueak.  
__label__pos	I started bouncing pupsqueak and he started squeaking and my son started laughing in delight.  
__label__pos	This is the first time a toy has made him laugh.  
__label__neu	He first giggled when grandpa talked to him and I've made him laugh a couple of times.  
__label__pos	But this toy had him in stitches.  
__label__pos	That kind of interaction with your kid is priceless and I've already gotten my money out of pupsqueak in just a few weeks.
__label__neg	The squeaker is hard to activate with your hand, especially in contrast to other Lamaze toys like the firefly and bug.  
__label__neu	What I have found, though, is that it is totally easy to make this dog squeak if you just mash his bottom on a hard surface.  
__label__neu	I think the mechanism for squeaking is bouncing the dogs rear end on a table or your hand or something else sort of hard (the bed works sometimes).  
__label__neu	I can totally see the 3* ratings frustration until I figured out how to make him squeak.  
__label__neg	There is not a good instruction manual for such a simple toy.
__label__neu	Hi folks -We bought this toy on a whim while out shopping at a dept store.  
__label__pos	It was inexpensive, less than six bucks, and it was so cute we decided to buy it for our 6-month old.
__label__pos	It is extremely cute, with a face painted onto the front surface.  
__label__pos	Bright vibrant primary colors typical of Fisher Price, sweet as can be.  
__label__pos	It makes a popping noise as it is pushed along and it absolutely delights my baby.  
__label__pos	When we push it toward him, he squeals with laughter and joy.  
__label__pos	It's actually pretty funny since it is not obvious what is amusing about this process but somehow he reacts as though you're about to attack him with tickles.
__label__neu	His favorite thing to do with this toy is to spin the little barrel that is on the top surface of the train behind the smokestack.  
__label__pos	There are little dimples in the spinnable barrel and he is really enjoying developing his dexterity of his index finger by putting his finger in the dimples and flicking.
__label__pos	A huge hit around here, highly recommend especially if you can find it for a reasonable price like we did.
__label__neg	"While it looks like it would be a great color, it's poorly made (thread count must be super low) and when it comes out of the drier, it has ""balls"" collected over it which also makes the sheet not-so-soft.  "
__label__neu	Go for the white!  
__label__pos	I have a couple of white pack 'n play sheets and they are holding up much better!!
__label__neu	Ok, ok, I will admit, a diaper wipe warmer seems like a bit much. 
__label__neu	When I first saw it in the store my mother and I laughed! 
__label__neu	She said babies today were going soft! 
__label__neu	Then my daughter was born, I would change her diaper and she would cry, and wet herself each time a chilly wipe would touch her backside. 
__label__neu	So, I buckled, and sent her daddy to by the Ultimate Wipes Warmer.
__label__pos	Well, all I can say is that I am truely pleased with this warmer. 
__label__pos	It really does the trick! 
__label__pos	Now, when I change my daughter, there are no more tears and no more washing the changing table pad either!
__label__pos	I haven't had any problems with the warmer burning on the bottom, like I have read in other reviews. 
__label__neg	The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that most wipe refills they sell don't have a layered configuration for easy dispencing, so you have to lift the lid each time you want a wipe. 
__label__pos	But I really don't think that that is such a big deal. 
__label__pos	And I would buy this warmer again in a heart beat!
__label__pos	I love the fact that this pump is so portable! 
__label__pos	And it does a great job with maintaining milk supply. 
__label__neu	The only pumps proven to do that are hospital-grade (which I've used). 
__label__pos	The Freestyle works just as well. 
__label__neg	"The ""hands-free"" design is ridiculous--rubber bands with clips!"
__label__neu	. 
__label__pos	Just get the Easy Expression Bustier and you're truly hands-free.
__label__neu	These are good, but they twist on the car seat shoulder straps.  
__label__neg	You have to straighten them out each time you put a child in the seat.
__label__neu	Our son has started to teeth so several moms reccomended this teether. 
__label__neu	It is very cute but he wont use it yet, we are still trying.
__label__neu	Will let the review know when and if he uses and likes it.
__label__pos	This mobile has great colors, is very interesting and totally captivates the attention of my 10 week old.  
__label__pos	It has nice music (not too mechanical or tinny sounding) and plays for a good amount of time - about 15 minutes.  
__label__pos	I love to look at it too!
__label__neg	I haven't had any of the mechanical problems that others have mentioned, but have noticed that sometimes if the mobile doesn't want to move, I just need to adjust it by moving the mobile unit in the stand (that attaches to the crib rail) just a little to the left or right.  
__label__neu	The mobile will start back up at that point.
__label__pos	"The songs and stories are so sweet, especially the ""What Does the World Look Like"" story. "
__label__pos	As soon as I heard that I knew I had made a good purchase. 
__label__pos	My daughter no longer sleeps in a crib, but I keep this on a shelf in her room and she turns it on whenever she passes it. 
__label__pos	I would recommend it to anyone.
__label__neu	We did alot of research on diaper pails and this one came out on top.  
__label__pos	It's virtually odor free (though not always!) and sturdy.  
__label__pos	We also like the fact that it can be used as a trash can later on.  
__label__pos	Most importantly, the bags are super easy to change!
__label__pos	my son has loved this toy since he was 5months old (i have posted pics). 
__label__pos	it's a beautiful toy and there is so much to keep busy hands (and mouths!
__label__neu	) busy. 
__label__neu	haba is my favorite wooden toy brand. 
__label__pos	anything and everything i have ever bought from them has been top notch! 
__label__pos	the colors are bold and won't chip. 
__label__pos	the wood is a dream to touch. 
__label__pos	and the design is perfect. 
__label__pos	you can't go wrong with this toy!
__label__pos	This is the only tub you need.  
__label__neu	It works for infants up to 3 year olds.  
__label__neu	Our newborn uses one side and the older toddler uses the other side.  
__label__pos	It is so multi-tasking.  
__label__neu	If you buy a newborn tub, you will be buying this one shortly thereafter because your newborn will outgrow the small one so quickly.  
__label__pos	Highly recommend.
__label__neu	New moms always pack EVERYTHING in their giant diaper bags.  
__label__pos	This bag makes sure you pack just the ESSENTIALS!  
__label__pos	We just finished up a Disneyworld vacation and this bag was SO EASY to carry, and fits enough supplies for 2 feedings, 5 diaper changes and 2 outfit changes (4 month old).  
__label__pos	It's so much easier to carry than a traditional messenger style diaper bag, and IT LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CRAP YOUR WIFE CAN PUT IN IT!  
__label__neu	We all know if it were up to her, she would put enough diapers/clothes in there to last a week.  
__label__pos	This bag is functional, stylish, and easy to carry.  
__label__pos	it also has small compartments for credit cards / pens.  
__label__pos	Great man-bag!
__label__pos	I only use these bottles, my daughter would not take any other ones right from the start. 
__label__pos	I can not compare to other brands but I can tell you that she doesn't spit up, which may be her naturally, but I wouldn't switch from these bottles just in case. 
__label__neu	They are more work to clean ,but if you buy enough they can be put in the dishwasher so it really isn't a big deal.  
__label__pos	I also read other reviews about leaking and can honestly say I have never had a single leak.  
__label__neu	"There is a line on the bottle that says not to fill above and also for travel they provide a ""travel disc"" to fit under the nipple to prevent leaks so I am not sure how other people have all these problems.  "
__label__pos	I really think these are a great product and certainly worth trying!
__label__neu	I'll admit that I was skeptical 
__label__neu	-- a $[...] teether crafted by hand in the French Alps from all natural rubber and paint 
__label__neu	-- I thought it was all hype.  
__label__pos	But I bought one anyway and quickly realized that this is not only the best teether on the market, it's also one of the best toys in general for 4-6 month olds.  
__label__neu	I got this for my son a little early, around 3 months.  
__label__pos	It wasn't until he was 4 months that he really started to like it.  
__label__pos	Now that he's 5 months old he and his Sophie the Giraffe are all but inseparable.  
__label__neu	We've offered him other teethers but nothing appeals to him like his Sophie the Giraffe.  
__label__neu	Now I won't leave home without it.  
__label__pos	If we're out and he starts to get fussy, all I have to do is pull out the giraffe and squeak it and he'll smile and reach for it.  
__label__pos	The way it's shaped is perfect for his little hands and mouth.  
__label__neu	Sometimes he'll grab the giraffe with both hands around the neck and chew on the feet.  
__label__neu	Other times he'll grab one leg in each hand and chew on the giraffe's ears.  
__label__neu	I have so many pictures of my son smiling with a giraffe's foot dangling out of one side of his mouth.  
__label__pos	And if he's happy; I'm happy.
__label__neu	I was concerned about getting this bundle me blanket because I thought that it would be too hot for Southern California weather, especially living by the ocean. 
__label__pos	The great thing is you can remove the top layer when it gets too hot and easily attach it again when it gets cooler in the evenings. 
__label__pos	I love that I never need to take a thick blanket with me, although I'd reccomend taking a receiving blanket (or a thick blanket for colder climates) in the diaper bag so your baby can be warm once you get him out of the bundle me blanket.
__label__pos	Awesome booster seat, easy to clean and stow. 
__label__neu	I'm a first time parent, in retrospect I would have skipped buying a regular highchair entirely if I had known about this. 
__label__neg	"One thing--the ""toys"" are silly plastic junk, I threw them away immediately. "
__label__neg	I agree with the other reviews, if you can find a cheaper version without the worthless plastic toys then get that one.
__label__neu	FYI!!  
__label__neu	This particular bottle is NOT BPA FREE!  
__label__neu	Not all of Nuby's bottles are BPA Free.  
__label__neu	"Only their ""Polypropylene Line"" of bottles are BPA Free.  "
__label__neu	"The packaging will say ""Polypropylene"" bottles.  "
__label__neu	This is the only way you'll know.  
__label__neu	"They won't actually say ""BPA Free"".  "
__label__neu	Very confusing - but these here are not the BPA Free Bottles!!
__label__pos	The whole idea of a baby tub with a shower is an excellent idea...
__label__neu	but I think they need to redesign the shower handle.  
__label__neg	It is almost impossible to hold the sprayer comfortably without blocking the water spray.  
__label__neu	Not to mention the button to get the water to spray is extremely hard to press down.  
__label__pos	The tub itself is a nice size and comes with the sling which helps a lot.  
__label__neu	I recommend buying a regular tub with a sling rather than spending the few extra bucks for the sprayer that doesn't work that well.  
__label__neu	A cup or washcloth will do the trick.
__label__neu	We now own two of these gates/yards. 
__label__neu	We originally purchased the yard to wrap around our stone wall/fireplace. 
__label__neu	"The wall was too ""freeform"" to use regular 90-degree and straight-edge padding, so we figured by snaking this yard around the fireplace and entertainment center we'd pretty well babyproof the whole living room. "
__label__neu	Currently we are using one gate to block off the bottom of the stairs and one at the top (we're in a rental home and cannot bolt the sturdier ones to the wall). 
__label__neu	"We use them as a deterant and NOT as a ""babysitter."" "
__label__neu	"Our daughter is always supervised, but it's nice to have a ""split second accident preventer."" "
__label__neu	In other words, it would take her some time to move the gate and go around it, by which time we would have caught her red-handed. 
__label__pos	"Our first gate made it through a cross-country move with ""Break and Dent Van Lines"" with no issues..."
__label__neu	if only all our items would have been so durable. 
__label__pos	Anyway, well worth the cost for a variety of uses!
__label__neu	I didn't get much use out of this b/c when it was time to switch over to our particular convertible car seat, there was no way to safely anchor the mirror as well (b/c a tether came over the top and side of the car seat to the anchor in back.)
__label__neu	So I was going to sell the mirror, but then I touched the mirror with my hand (I guess I had lotion on??) and there was a huge black smear.
__label__neu	So I tried to get the smear off with window cleaner, and that made the whole mirror worse, so now it's all foggy!
__label__neg	Also, the remote didn't come even close to fitting on my visor.
__label__neu	Our son received Mortimer for Christmas this last year.  
__label__neu	He was only 2 months old.  
__label__pos	Now he is going on 9 months and he stills loves him.  
__label__pos	His antlers are great for teething.  
__label__neu	His feet either have a bell in them or are crinkly sounding; as is his scarf.  
__label__pos	Where his tail would be he has a couple teething loops which are great for baby's gums.
__label__pos	I love these keepers-my five month old takes Soothies as well as Playtex Orthos; when using with the Soothies, I find the penguin and the bee style both to be a little big and kind of in the way, but he loves the penguin because he can grip it and pop the pacifier in and out of his mouth. 
__label__neu	(The bee-not shown here, obviously-has little antennae that are sort of in his line of view) 
__label__pos	The best part about them is that I discovered (sort of a 'duh' moment) that you can, in fact, detach the string from the plastic creature and wind it through the same way on the rings of his Playtex pacifiers. 
__label__neu	So while the body isnt meant to work with any other pacifier, the strings and clip do.
__label__pos	I love our papasan. 
__label__pos	My daughter sometimes prefers to sleep in it rather than anything else. 
__label__pos	The vibration is a life saver because our daughter likes constant movement. 
__label__pos	It shuts off by itself every 15 minutes, which is great because I often forget to turn it off.
__label__neu	I purchased our papasan from amazon (this page). 
__label__neu	I really liked the blanket that is shown in the customer photos, but the blanket does not come with this model. 
__label__neu	I was kind of disappointed to find that out, but we love it.
__label__pos	My little baby girl loves this chair.  
__label__pos	It's perfect for the livingroom when my husband and I are sitting and chilling out watching TV.  
__label__pos	In the afternoon when I need a few minutes to put her down and start a load of laundry - this chair works out perfect.  
__label__pos	I just put on the vibration feature and she wisks off to dream land... 
__label__pos	or is pleasantly entertained while I am walking around (with child free hands).
__label__pos	Being able to put her down every once in a while is wonderful since she seems to have an issue with gas and possible reflux.  
__label__pos	This chair works great because it elevates her to a position where she is totally comfortable and able to sleep.  
__label__pos	I got this as a registry gift (and added it from a recommendation from a friend), and I am so happy we have it.  
__label__neu	We also added the Natures Touch Cradle Swing to our registry.  
__label__neu	We have that in the kitchen and the Papasan in the livingroom.
__label__neu	Definitely add this to your registry or purchase it yourself for your baby... 
__label__pos	it's worth the money and freedom your arms get *especially with a fussy baby always needing to be held*.
__label__pos	Like the reviewer who gave it a low rating, I also have small breasts, but unlike her, I found this pillow very helpful. 
__label__pos	It fit perfectly around my middle so me and the baby could be comfortable during feedings. 
__label__pos	It saved a lot of strain on my neck, arms & back. 
__label__neu	My husband used it when he just wanted to hold & rock the baby without wearing out his arms. 
__label__pos	The slipcovers come off easily to be machine-washed. 
__label__pos	I highly, highly recommend this if you're going to breastfeed or even if you just want some hands-free time while still keeping the baby close. 
__label__neu	My baby doesn't need it anymore so now I use it as my neck pillow!
__label__neu	First I purchased the Britax Boulevard and then The First Years True Fit.  
__label__neu	Both were huge and bulky.  
__label__neu	When fully tightened in the rear-facing position using the LATCH system, both could be grasped by their bases from the front seat and pulled forward, pushing baby's head into the back seat.  
__label__neu	The same could be done by just pushing on the backs of these carseats (in the rear-facing position), so baby's face would slam into the back seat in a head-on collision!
__label__neu	The Sunshine Radian is different!  
__label__neu	It has a detachable base which, when installed in the rear-facing position, fully fills in the gap between the carseat and seat back.  
__label__neu	No bulky towels that shift, no water noodles that get squished down.  
__label__neu	And a SNUG FIT!  
__label__pos	Additionally, there is a very easy floor tether that secures this carseat further, even in the rear-facing position (The First Years True Fit offers no such tether, and Britax's rear-facing tether is strung over baby's head!) and even if your car doesn't come manufactured with a specific tether point!
__label__pos	The mesh fabric stays dry and cool even on the hottest days, there's plenty of leg room even in the rear-facing position, and this whole seat fits (albeit snuggly) in the backseat of my 2004 Saturn LW300 (a very small backseat!).  
__label__neu	Also, there's a little card pouch to fill out with your child's medical information in case of an accident so emergency personel can immediately treat your child!
__label__pos	This is a great buy.  
__label__neu	It sings to your child when they sit down and plays a tune when they actually go.  
__label__pos	My little one loves it and even knows how to empty it!  
__label__pos	You can't go wrong with this one - it's just really cute and comfortable.  
__label__pos	Not to mention VERY easy to clean!
__label__neu	I bought this breast pump after a mother of 3 recommended buying a medela pump and after buying the manual medela harmony pump. 
__label__neu	I did my research and decided this was the pump that would suit my needs. 
__label__neu	I decided to quit nursing but wanted to give my daughter breastmilk. 
__label__neu	I was also going to be returning to work and needed to pump for when I am gone.
__label__pos	Pros:After figuring out how to pump properly, I started getting more milk. 
__label__pos	It has a suction control which helps when I am sore and need a lower setting. 
__label__neu	It also has a 2 minute letdown which automatically switches to regular pumping. 
__label__pos	You can also push the button to go back and forth between regular and letdown mode. 
__label__pos	I like that I can pump one breast at a time or double pump. 
__label__pos	I liked all the accessories the package came with such as sample nipple cream, breast pads, and bottles. 
__label__neu	The pump also fits standard bottles. 
__label__pos	It's easy to clean after each session and has less pieces per breast than the Harmony.
__label__neg	Cons:It's quite heavy and sometimes a pain to move from the regular spot that I keep it. 
__label__neg	The bottles did not come with rings so I have to use the rings from other bottles to use the bottle to feed my daughter. 
__label__neu	The nipple shields were not the correct size and I had to buy a different size.
__label__pos	This tub is just the best! 
__label__neu	I have a 3-week old, and we've used it every other day since he's been home, and he fussed for the first two times, but now he loves it! 
__label__neu	The little pillow head rest/support is useless right now, and is actually a nuisance (we tuck it under the hammock) but maybe when he gets bigger, it'll come in handy. 
__label__pos	This is my second child, but they're 8 years apart- I wish they had this 8 years ago! 
__label__pos	With my first, I had to give her first baths (until her umbilical cord fell off) on her changing table- but with this tub, the hammock is great! 
__label__pos	"The baby is not submerged under water, and the hammock is soft so it cradles and conforms to the baby, unlike all the other ""hard"" tubs out there. "
__label__pos	A comfy baby is a happy baby- a happy baby is a happy parent! =)
__label__pos	My 7 month old has had this for about 2 months now, and he loves this toy. 
__label__pos	It never gets old! 
__label__neu	Sometimes he tires himself out jumping, and falls asleep in it...
__label__pos	which is adorable! 
__label__pos	I have also found that if he is really sleepy, and fighting going to sleep, I can put him in this and he is out within minutes, and I can take him out of it after he's been asleep for a few minutes and go put him in his bed without him waking up! 
__label__pos	He loves all the toys on it, especially both the parrots. 
__label__pos	He also loves it when I hold his legs up while he is in it, move him around in circles, and tell him he's in a flying saucer! =)
__label__neu	not bulky, the stickies work great, but I imagine in time they may not stick (that's usually the case with most of these cushions).
__label__pos	I really enjoy the fact that this swing is portable, very light, and most importantly...
__label__pos	that my daughter enjoys it. 
__label__pos	The lights and sounds hold her interest which is particularly nice after she's had a full night's sleep as is waiting patiently for her bottle. 
__label__pos	This swing is helpful in that it provides some down-time after a lot of playing  and allows Mom to get a few things done around the house too.
__label__pos	This is awesome!  
__label__neu	I use it everyday to feed my son.  
__label__pos	It is so much easier and much less messy.  
__label__neu	I already bought a 2nd one for us and one for a friend and I will get one for my sister-in-law when my niece is a little older.  
__label__pos	I am really impressed with this one!
__label__neu	It us super cute but my baby (since 6 month) spends her time removing the little connectors and uses them as teethers and that is NOT OK because it is easy to get little pieces to come off and swallow by baby.
__label__neu	The material is Ethylene vinyl acetate and is not meant to be ingested!
__label__neu	Buy a simple foam mat with no small connectors
__label__neu	Per Wired Magazine's May 2005 edition (Page 61): Shopping cart handle germ count: 1 MILLION.
__label__neu	If just 10 percent were influenza virus, you could pick up: 510 germs.
__label__neu	Number that would make you sick: 1.
__label__neu	When I think of my children touching those surfaces and then putting their little hands in their mouths, or rubbing their eyes... 
__label__neg	yuck, makes me squeemish.
__label__neu	I'm ordering two today: One for each car so dad and I can cut down on the contagion we battled this last year.
__label__neu	[The number of germs on a toilet handle, btw, is only 50,000]
__label__pos	I haven't used other tubs to compare this one to, but it met our needs just fine.  
__label__neu	We used the sling when he was a newborn, and now my 12-month old is still using the bath on the toddler side.  
__label__neu	He slides around too much in the regular tub, and this keeps him more under control, and it uses much less water than filling up the whole tub.
__label__neu	The temperature gauge has to get pretty darn hot to start changing color, so I don't use it.  
__label__neu	I never use it outside of the sink or tub, so I'm not sure how the leaking is.
__label__neu	No mildew problems so far, and I just drain it and air-dry it after each use.
__label__neu	My son was a very light sleeper and any little noise would wake him up. 
__label__neu	I bought this thinking that it wouldn't work but was worth a try. 
__label__pos	It actually did help him to stay asleep. 
__label__pos	He would sleep for hours at a time as long as the machine was on. 
__label__pos	It actually helped me to relax too bc we slept in the same room. 
__label__pos	I don't like things hanging on this crib so I liked that this machine can be put anywhere.
__label__neu	I put it on the floor under his bassinet then on a short stool next to his crib. 
__label__neu	I haven't had to use it lately but I keep it close by just in case.
__label__pos	My son absolutely loves this. 
__label__pos	It is very stimulating and the 15 minutes of music is a nice variety. 
__label__pos	The best mobile I have seen yet...
__label__neu	I bought this after my agonizing for my first child born in February....
__label__neu	it worked well for us and had her close without being in my bed ( not wanting to break that habit later of sleeping with us plus she was only 6 pounds at birth). 
__label__neu	I knew a bassinet would only last so long and was told to not waste my money by more experienced moms. 
__label__pos	This fit well in our room, washed well ( leakydiapers and spitup), secured to the bed and holds so much! 
__label__neu	I stored all of her bath things under the bed with blankets, onesies, and burp cloths. 
__label__neu	Diapers and wipes on the side with room left. 
__label__neu	Now that my daughter is in her crib at night I moved this downstairs to let her sleep in during the day. 
__label__neu	Just lifted it and took it downstairs! 
__label__neu	Only reason I did not give this 5 stars is I wished I had been thinking ahead and had gotten the original because I could have left it at Grandma's for her to use as a playpen once she outgrew the sleeper part. 
__label__neu	This does not convert to a play area so if this is a future consideration then get the original. 
__label__neu	Best for small spaces, travel to family and in hotels, and roomier and appears safer than bassinet. 
__label__pos	Will use again for next child! 
__label__pos	4 1/2 stars
__label__pos	I love this oven lock!  
__label__pos	It is easy to use.  
__label__pos	It feels heavy duty.  
__label__neu	My toddler twins won't be able to figure this one out! 
__label__neu	I was worried about what this white lock would look like on my black oven.  
__label__neu	I don't mind it at all.  
__label__pos	I highly recommend this lock!
__label__neu	When my daughter was first born we bought a bath sponge in the shape of a bear that was about 2 inches thick. 
__label__neu	For the first month or two while we bathed her in a baby bathtub it worked great. 
__label__neu	But once we moved her into a big bathtub we realized we needed something more.
__label__neu	This bath pillow elevates the head of the baby while giving her a lot of support throughout the body. 
__label__neu	You can posistion it at the end of your tub so she is on an incline as well.
__label__pos	I liked that this pillow grows with your baby and will be good at helping an older baby sit in the bath better making bath time more enjoyable.
__label__neu	It has a hanger that is attached so you just hang it to let it dry. 
__label__neu	And the auquarium print on it is gender neutral.
__label__neu	My son has been using this teether since he was about 4 months old. 
__label__pos	It's unique to look at and very functional. 
__label__pos	The nubby raspberry portion soothes gums while it's entire soft texture is easy to hold. 
__label__pos	Love it.
__label__neu	Please ignore the reviewer who rated the seat one star due to the rebound issue.  
__label__neu	I am a certified child passenger safety technician and this is NOT a safety concern.  
__label__neg	Almost all rear facing seats will rebound in a crash.  
__label__neu	The only ones that won't are infant seats with rigid LATCH (the only one currently available in the US is the Baby Trend Latch-Loc with rigid LATCH) or one with an anti-rebound bar like the Britax Companion and convertible seats that tether rear facing (all Britax convertible seats, Sunshine Kids Radian, etc).  
__label__neu	As long as your seat moves less than an inch in any direction AT THE BELT PATH (i.e. on an infant seat with a base, right at the seat crack where the other poster said it was tight) it is safe.  
__label__pos	The Chicco KeyFit is a very good seat.  
__label__pos	It is without a doubt one of the best on the market currently.  
__label__pos	It installs like a dream and fits small babies very well.  
__label__pos	As a tech of seven years, I would not hesitate to recommend this seat or use it for my own child.
__label__neu	My 12 week old daughter is all over the place when it's time to sleep and has been since day 1.  
__label__pos	For some reason, she loves to be swaddled and we have been swaddling her since she was a week or so old.  
__label__pos	The Swaddler is great because you don't have to make a trifold out of a blanket and have them wriggle their way out of it after a few minutes. 
__label__pos	The velcro stays put and she stays inside tight and neat like a baby burrito and falls RIGHT to sleep in minutes - if she's really tired, SECONDS!  
__label__neg	I was unable to use the newborn size Swaddler right away because she was too small.  
__label__pos	The First Years makes a two pack of swaddling blankets which fit a 7 lb. baby perfectly.  
__label__neu	Also, make sure you don't use a fleece Swaddler if it's too warm - use the cotton one.  
__label__neu	I've read that baby overheating can lead to SIDS.  
__label__neu	If your baby is active and won't settle down, SWADDLE HER!! 
__label__pos	Babies love it!
__label__neu	Starting as a newborn, my son would just lie on his back and stare at this thing, batting it around occasionally, for almost an hour at a time.  
__label__neu	Anyone with a newborn knows that is precious, precious time for you to do something else, while keeping an eye on the baby, of course.  
__label__neu	As he got older, he'd start to teeth on the dangling things, then he eventually would sit under it, still playing, and he's 12 months now, so it's disassembled (it takes up a lot of space), but he still plays with all the toys and links it came with.
__label__pos	I felt in love with Sophie the very first time I saw her. 
__label__neu	THANK GOD I HAVE A DAUGHTER! 
__label__neu	"So I bought it ""for her"". "
__label__neu	But, Oh My!... 
__label__pos	my daughter loves Sophie too! 
__label__neu	She was 3 months old when Sophie arrived at our house. 
__label__pos	The very first moment she saw Sophie, she smiled. 
__label__pos	Now Sophie is her company, and even makes her stop crying. 
__label__pos	Sophie is soft for my baby's gums and even though people say that the rubber smell bothers them, I like it. 
__label__pos	My daughter loves to suck on her face and ears. 
__label__pos	Sophie is a really great toy, and even though the price is a little high, believe me, it's worth it. 
__label__neu	I would buy Sophie again here at Amazon if we lost her. 
__label__pos	We are really pleased with this cute toy.
__label__pos	I also like the weight and music of this toy - it also worked well for us in a long car ride (at night) to add some light and color display :)
__label__pos	This is a great purchase.  
__label__neu	I bought this stroller for my twin girls.  
__label__neu	I wanted something that would make my life easier with two car seats.  
__label__pos	It is very easy to use and lightweight compared to other twin strollers.  
__label__pos	I have used this several times to go to the doctors and grocery store and would recommend it to any twin parent.
__label__neu	I bought this for our garden tub and it just barely fits.  
__label__neu	The curved edges of the tub don't allow the basket to sit entirely on the edge, and I have the basket extended to it's largest size.  
__label__pos	But it is great in that I can keep the kids away from the spout and the kids are able to clean up their own toys and it gives me storage for their bath products.  
__label__pos	The slats also allow toys to drain nicely.  
__label__neu	I originally wanted one of those cute frog scoop storage things from Boon, but once I thought about it for a minute, I realized that I didn't want to pay that much money for the thing and I didn't want to have to clean up after the kids!
__label__neu	We bought this right after we began putting my daughter to bed in her crib.  
__label__neu	She had been sleeping in a bassinet that had a small music/sound box attached and had gotten used to falling asleep to the sound of waves or trickling water.  
__label__neu	But then we started putting her in her crib...
__label__neu	she tossed & turned and took awhile to fall asleep.  
__label__neu	I think maybe it was just too quiet for her without the noises she had become accustomed to. 
__label__pos	We bought the Sound Sleeper and it was like magic!  
__label__neu	She falls asleep without any fussing.  
__label__pos	There are alot of settings for different sounds and I like that it has a 1 hour timer feature.
__label__pos	I didn't have this bouncer in the first few weeks, but once I purchased it, I don't know what I did without it!  
__label__pos	It is so nice to be able to put the baby down in something and have your hands free.  
__label__neu	Whenever baby is fussy and doesn't necessarily want to be held, I can put him in this, and he calms right down.  
__label__pos	I don't always use the entertainment bar, but when I do, he loves it!  
__label__pos	He likes to watch the bubbles and listen to the music/waves/etc.  
__label__neg	The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is that sometime the bubbles will stop working and I have to smack the bar to get it going again.
__label__neu	Other than that, I have not had any problems with it.  
__label__pos	We have had several diaper blow-outs and spit-ups on this, but the material washes up like a dream--does not shrink at all.  
__label__pos	I would recommend this to any parent!
__label__neu	I bought these after reading the reviews.  
__label__pos	They are MUCH better than the Gerber ones.  
__label__pos	"They dont ""leak"" out the goodies so easily or the crumbs.  "
__label__pos	Def a must have for little snackers
__label__neu	I got this stroller for a international trip back to the USA with my 2 1/2 year old.  
__label__neu	I needed a light umbrella stroller but didn't want to give up and get ones of those cheap 10 dollar ones.  
__label__pos	I LOVE this stroller.  
__label__pos	It is super light. 
__label__pos	It is really easy to fold up on my own and quickly when I am in line for security. 
__label__pos	The back basket was SO easy to get to.  
__label__neu	I have tried to get into the backs of a Mclaren stroller before it was much harder.  
__label__pos	This was a great buy and worth it for our trip. 
__label__pos	I love that the padding is removable for washing or for hot days.  
__label__neu	I have noticed that since my trip my stroller doesn't stand on its own as well either.
__label__neu	I attempted to use this bottle warmer with Born Free bottles...
__label__neg	I had the bottle inside (supposedly being warmed up) for nearly 30 minutes and nothing.  
__label__neu	The actual heating insulation arm would heat up but not the bottle.  
__label__neg	Very unimpressed and returned it.
__label__pos	I just love this whole color scheme.  
__label__neu	We painted our son's room blue and got every piece to this set. 
__label__pos	It is just such a nice change from the baby blue with pastel colored bedding sets.  
__label__neu	It is definitely a little boy's bedding set.  
__label__neu	Some many things match it outside of this collection too because of the blue and red combination.  
__label__pos	The sheets wash well too which is a nice plus.
__label__pos	I got this as a shower gift and I don't know what I'd do without it. 
__label__pos	It helps with sponge bathing newborns and it keeps the baby warm when water is poored over it. 
__label__neu	I lay it on the bathroom counter and fill tHE sink with water. 
__label__neg	The only minor problem is the water goes through, but I put a big towel underneath it so it cathes the water. 
__label__pos	I like the hook on the top so it's easy to hang up to air dry over the shower head. 
__label__neu	I haven't had any problems with mildew and it is machine washable. 
__label__pos	Excellent product!!
__label__pos	I have a three and a half month old son and this is a miracle when putting him to sleep. 
__label__pos	He loves the image and the sounds (the water drops are his favorite). 
__label__pos	I would recommend this to anyone.
__label__pos	Perfect accessory for strollers without a parent tray on the handles. 
__label__pos	Surprisingly large amount of storage. 
__label__pos	Easily removable to take into the car. 
__label__pos	And when done serving the baby's stroller, easily attaches to chair backs or anything with slots to store toys, crayons, kitchen utensils, etc.
__label__pos	We go on picnics all summer and this is great!  
__label__pos	It's soft and water repellent so any liquid spills are not absorbed and can easily be wiped off. 
__label__pos	It's super cute and easy to store and tote along plus it's thick enough that even if you do pick a picnic spot with sticks and rocks underneath, you won't feel anything poke through.
__label__neu	It's pretty big as far as picnic blankets go and if they were to offer a blanket a few sizes larger, I would buy it in a heartbeat.  
__label__neu	This sized blanket can comfortably seat 2 adults with picnic meals.  
__label__neu	4 adults comfortably if there's nothing to eat and they're just keeping their bums dry.
__label__neu	It's not a blanket that will keep you warm, so don't expect to be able to snuggle up under it or with it - it's a picnic blanket for sitting, eating and relaxing on.  
__label__pos	I love it and have taken it to concerts in the park, picnics, festivals, wineries - basically any place where we might want to relax outdoors and not worry about finding provided seating.
__label__neu	I bought this product because of the reviews I read about it.  
__label__neg	However it DOES NOT keep out the smell of dirty diapers.  
__label__neu	I have used it for 7 months now and had to go buy a different one. 
__label__neu	If you are like me, you want the products you buy to do the intended job.  
__label__neg	This is not what you want.  
__label__neu	Get the Diaper Champ or use a regular trash can and put it out of the way (extra bathroom, laundry room, etc.)
__label__pos	My daughter LOVED this chair! 
__label__neu	She would sleep in it the first 3 months (it helped keep her upright). 
__label__neu	She was sleeping 6 hours a night at 6 weeks and 8 hours by 10 weeks. 
__label__neu	But she would only sleep that long in this chair. 
__label__pos	It was awesome. 
__label__neu	After she could sleep through the night in her crib, she would sit in the chair and play with toys or watch tv (gasp). 
__label__pos	It was just a great chair. 
__label__neu	On the other hand, I was so excited to have it for my son (#2), but he would not sit still in it at all. 
__label__pos	So when they sit it in, it's fantastic. 
__label__neu	When they don't, they don't. 
__label__neu	Granted, he would not sit in any type of bouncy chair for very long (only the swing for him, which my daughter never used).
__label__pos	This one of the most useful baby products out there.  
__label__neu	It keeps all those bath toys together.  
__label__neu	Made of sturdy plastic and mesh, with strong suction cups.  
__label__neu	It is large enough to hold all of my son's various bath toys and foam letters.  
__label__neu	It is open so that my son can get out whatever toys he wants to play with.  
__label__neu	The cubby has a mesh front, as well as a mesh bottom so that all toys dry completely without mildewing.  
__label__neu	I have had no problems getting the suction cups on it to stick to our tile tub either. 
__label__neu	It has stayed since the first day I put it there.  
__label__pos	This is just great!  
__label__pos	It has a cute little fish theme.  
__label__neu	We have the matching ocean wonders bathroom space saver as well.  
__label__pos	Highly recommended!!
__label__pos	This Mobile is perfect for newborns.  
__label__pos	We hung this over our changing table, and our daughter was in love.  
__label__pos	She would smile, and talk to this mobile.  
__label__neu	It often got more smiles than we did.
__label__pos	My son was small for his age for the first few months, but this swing was perfect for him.  
__label__neu	He would watch us do housework or sleep...  
__label__neg	By the time he weighed 16lbs though, it wouldn't rock fast enough to keep him happy and he kept trying to crawl out.
__label__pos	I am totally impressed with this stroller.  
__label__pos	I did a lot of research and I don't regret my choice to purchase this one. 
__label__pos	I love it...
__label__pos	my kids love it...
__label__pos	basically everyone that sees it loves it.
__label__pos	Features I love:*The seats are padded enough that my 3 month old and 2-1/2 year old are comfy* You can move the sun shade down completely in front of the sitting children if the sun is directly in front.  
__label__neu	I had no idea that it was this retractable.
__label__neu	*there is a mp3 speaker/hookup though it is rather poor quality as far as sound goes* the large tires and pivot front wheel make for great steering* the width of the stroller is not a challenge.  
__label__neu	It is a wider stroller, however I have not found a doorway in a public place I cannot fit through.  
__label__neu	I think this is because it is no wider than a wheelchair would be and most building accommodate that.
__label__pos	FOR THE PRICE this stroller rocks my world!
__label__neg	I wish this blanket wasn't so expensive! 
__label__pos	It makes for an excellent baby shower gift.
__label__pos	It is a perfect receiving/swaddling blanket.  
__label__neu	Most of the cheaper ones are too small for when the baby grows past a few months.  
__label__pos	Due to its size, it lasts much longer, is much softer, and is a great product. 
__label__pos	It keeps the baby warm and secure, and has a nice snug fit. 
__label__neu	It does not come undone when the baby moves around.  
__label__neu	You can fold it to adjust for the size of baby when they are small, and then adjust as they grow.
__label__neu	BUY this for your friends and family! 
__label__pos	They will thank you.
__label__neu	Bought this for my 3 month old because, quite frankly, it just looked too cute to pass up and she needed more toys. 
__label__pos	:)  She loves it!  
__label__neu	She stays under it talking and checking everything out and it's so much fun for me to lay next to it with her and watch her discover everything.  
__label__pos	Even her older siblings (5 & 4) love to rearrange all the toys and keep it interesting for her.  
__label__pos	I also love that it can be a tummy time mat.  
__label__pos	There are a few cute little 'touch' features on the mat, but it also includes a few toy loops across the edge.  
__label__neu	I use plastic links to connect from one loop to the next, then attach toys to the links, so she has a little chain of toys that can't get too far out of her grasp.  
__label__pos	The colors are great and the animals are adorable.  
__label__neg	The only thing that kept it from being a 5-star for me was that you need a teeny screwdriver (eyeglass size, probably) to open the battery compartment.  
__label__neu	We've had it for a week now and I still haven't found my little screwdriver to check out the electronic features.  
__label__pos	Still, it's working out really well for us, and if it's anything like the matching mobile and Jumperoo, I expect that I'll still be pleased with the purchase.
__label__neu	I bought these before our trip to Disney.  
__label__neu	We had a couple of these that were the Snack Trap brand that we had lost around town (they are probably underfoot at Target somewhere).  
__label__neu	I thought those were a little cheap and the plastic lids had turned a yucky color--they just looked dingy.  
__label__pos	Anyway, I bought the Munchkin brand and am super happy with them.  
__label__pos	They came quickly from Amazon and they are very sturdy.  
__label__neu	They also hold lots of goldfish!  
__label__pos	A necessity with a toddler!  
__label__pos	The handles are nice and wide to fit her chunky hands and they can handle the abuse she dishes out by banging it on every surface she can find.  
__label__pos	Great product--highly recommend it!
__label__neg	This monitor did not work for us. 
__label__neu	It let out a loud click about every 20 seconds or so and then about once an hour it would start giving out static for about a minute for no reason.  
__label__neg	This monitor kept us from sleeping and we had to go exchange it.  
__label__neg	NO GOOD!
__label__neu	I read a book and two before making the transition from the bottle to the sippy cup, right before my son's 1st b-day! 
__label__neu	It pretty much prepared me for the battle that was about to unfold.
__label__pos	However, you can't even imagine the relief of having my son totally love this sippy cup FROM THE FIRST TRY!!!
__label__neu	5 stars! 
__label__neu	It defenitely works for my lil munchkin!
__label__pos	Great for winter use! 
__label__neu	Works better in carseat than it does in our strollers (Kolcraft-due to straps in strollers), but it did keep our daughter super warm during Christmas in Park outing!
__label__neu	I got this thinking I could keep a wipe case, diapers and the changing pad in it, well I can't. 
__label__neu	I can fit one diaper and the wipe case and changing pad, but I need more than one diaper in it. 
__label__neu	I keep 4 diapers in it and then bought the Skip Hop Swipe wipe case and hooked it on to the diaper pod and put the changing pad in the back pocket. 
__label__neu	The changing pad is very small btw, my 2 month old doesn't fit on it very well anymore. 
__label__neu	Oh well, we  make do and I just make sure her bottom is at least on the pad. 
__label__neu	Overall a good product, I just think it should be a little bigger.
__label__pos	We've had great luck with this tub. 
__label__neu	Many of the negative reviews seen to focus on the hump in the middle, and it must depend on the relative size and muscle development of the child. 
__label__pos	Our son has fit just perfectly.  
__label__neu	The only problem we had with the sling, was our son did seem suspended too high--but we just added more water, so that the tub was full to the brim.  
__label__neu	He was then high enough up that his back didn't rest on the hump and he stayed warm in the water.
__label__neu	It is a big tub, so we have used it in the bathtub ever since his second bath on the kitchen counter when he peed on our toaster oven.  
__label__neu	Which is sort of irrelevant to the tub, but highlights the dangers (an hilarity) of a bath in the kitchen.
__label__neu	Once he got bigger, he fit just fine in both sides of the tub. 
__label__neg	Sadly, at 10 months he had gotten too big to wash easily and he can stand up, which is awkard with the shape of the tub. 
__label__neu	The first time we bathed him without the tub he CRIED!  
__label__neu	But I bribed him with his favorite toy and now all is well.
__label__pos	My daughter loves this.  
__label__neu	I bought it for her when she was 4 mos old.  
__label__neu	Even on the lowest height setting she had to stand on her tip toes.  
__label__neu	Not for long though now she rotates, jumps, pounces pulls and chews on the toys.  
__label__pos	The buttons that make the animal sounds are her favorite.  
__label__neg	The only con lies with the issue of portability.  
__label__neu	It is not easy to break down and transport.  
__label__neg	It is cumbersome. 
__label__neu	Even taking it from room to room requires some manipulation to fit through the doorways.  
__label__neu	That said, I would still buy it again.  
__label__neu	My suggestion is to take your infant with you to the store before you purchase any of these bouncers/saucers/entertainers.  
__label__neu	Choose a store that has various models on display. 
__label__neu	I had planned to buy the Evenflow saucer, however, my daughter seemed overwhelmed by all of the toys on the Evenflow.  
__label__neu	There were a few saucers that really didn't hold her attention at all.  
__label__neu	That is how I decided on the Baby Einstein.  
__label__neu	She instantly began squealing and playing with the toys.  
__label__neu	One infant's junk is another infant's treasure.  
__label__neu	For the bigger ticket toys, it is worthwile to know how it will be received before you make the purchase.
__label__neu	I purchased this to use in my daughter's crib over-night since she seems to leak through her diaper and pajamas no matter what and I was getting very tired of changing sheets every morning.
__label__neu	This pad is HUGE, much bigger than I was expecting - it will easily cover an entire crib mattress.  
__label__neu	I decided to cut it in half and just use half at a time since my daughter tends to stick to one end of her crib when she sleeps at night.  
__label__neu	It's wide enough that I can just tuck the ends under the Cozy Wedge crib bumber and she has room to roll around in her sleep without it bunching up beneath her.  
__label__neu	I've only washed it once but it does seem like the ends will fray very easily so I think when I do need to wash it I'll do so on a gentle cycle and let it air dry to help it last a little longer.
__label__pos	I would say this was well worth the price considering the size of the pad, and it has a cute print on it.  
__label__neu	Last night my daughter was 'picking' at the little colored dots on the pad.
__label__pos	The cloth diapers are great as burp clothes or anything else you need to use them for to soak up wet stuff.  
__label__pos	They are at least twice as soft and thick as other cloth diapers.
__label__pos	This is the perfect bath for an infant. 
__label__pos	I love fact that it's soft instead of hard plastic which allows is to soak up warm water fast and is comfy for baby.
__label__neu	It dries out very quickly and doesn't mildew.
__label__pos	This is a great manual pump.  
__label__neu	After bringing my Medela electric pump back and forth between home and the office for a few weeks I decided to purchase a manual pump to keep at home.  
__label__neu	I was worried that someday I would forget the electric pump at home and have to go a whole day without pumping.  
__label__neu	Ouch!  
__label__pos	I found that this pump would express the milk just as fast if not faster than my electric and was comfortable to use.  
__label__neu	"I don't use the ""petal attachment"" as I found that I didn't need it.  "
__label__neu	It may just be how my breasts are shaped though.  
__label__neu	Sure my hand got a little tired but its not bad plus its good exercise.  
__label__pos	:)  I still love my duel electric for work just for ease of use but love this little guy for the occasional home use.
__label__neu	My son used to hate bathtime - turns out he just wanted a little more freedom and mobility.  
__label__pos	Now he loves it and takes nice long and leisurely baths playing with his toys, splashing around.  
__label__pos	I love it too because with my hands free I can take a bath with him and not worry about him tipping over.  
__label__pos	It is a leisurely bath for everyone!
__label__neu	The only reason I give it 4 stars is that I wish it had a little padding around the edge where the child leans over.  
__label__neg	My son sort of hangs over and it looks a little uncomfortable.
__label__pos	then of course, you'll love these!  
__label__pos	They are adorable, soft and a good size for my 4 month old.  
__label__pos	Very happy with them!
__label__neu	Well the fact that it is a leash was really not the problem, cause I mean when you buy it, you already know that! 
__label__neg	LOLMy daughter would have more tantrums wearing it than not. 
__label__neg	Every time I would put it on her, she would scream and beg me not to put it on. 
__label__neg	It was really heartbreaking. 
__label__pos	On the plus side, this item really taught my daughter to walk next to me and listen to me LOLWe used it a couple of time and put it aside. 
__label__neg	She really hated it and I felt that it caused more tention than it is worth.
__label__neu	I purchased this gate at Babies R Us, but read the reviews first from Amazon.  
__label__neu	I just purchased a toddler bed for my child and the gate is used to keep her in her bedroom at night.  
__label__pos	The gate was so easy to put together and fits perfectly at the entrance of her bedroom door.  
__label__neu	To open it, all you do is step on the foot pedal, which is needs weight to open.  
__label__neg	The only problem I have now, is that my child closes the gate all the time.  
__label__neu	When it's suppose to stay open.  Oh, well!!
__label__neu	In an effort to stop my son's painful gas, I have been through countless bottles.  
__label__neu	I did not want to try the Dr. Browns because of all the parts and they seemed too complicated.  
__label__pos	Once I gave in, I was glad I did.  
__label__pos	The bottles are not at all hard to wash or assemble.  
__label__pos	These bottles have greatly reduced my son's discomfort.
__label__neu	Someone wrote that they had problems with the bottles leaking.  
__label__neu	If the tube assembly is crooked and not on straight, the bottle will leak.  
__label__neu	So put it on straight and there's no problem!
__label__neu	I only wish they came with more than 2 storage caps.  
__label__pos	The caps are very handy unlike the little discs other bottles have for you to put in the bottle rings.
__label__pos	Amazing! The woombie that is sold on amazon at the moment is size 0-3 months (newborn and up to 13 lbs). 
__label__neu	There are many other sizes available at the woombie website. 
__label__neu	My baby was born 8 lbs 2 oz and was 10 lbs at 4 weeks. 
__label__neu	We started to use it since when she was 5 days old. 
__label__pos	Now she is 2 months and she still loves the woombie. 
__label__neu	She sleeps from 10 pm until 5 or 6 am! I couldn't find it the other day and had to use Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe blanket I had and she wasn't too happy about it. 
__label__neu	She doesn't like that the Kiddopotamus blanket is too tight and restricting. 
__label__pos	In woombie she can stretch and move around her arms and legs more.
__label__pos	I received the Snugli as a shower gift and it is a wonderful product.  
__label__pos	I like that it is versatile and I will be able to use it not only for my newborn but as she gets older.  
__label__pos	My baby likes to be snuggled so this is ideal. 
__label__pos	I carry her around and can get things done in the home.
__label__pos	This is a delightful toy! 
__label__pos	The colors are wonderful, the size is perfect for me for therapy for rheumatoid arthritis in hands, and well, it just beams!
__label__pos	Haba toys are well-made, and this is no exception. 
__label__pos	It's wood with a quiet jingle bell and sturdy elastic cording covered by the wood, so you can bend it satisfyingly.
__label__pos	The colors just demanded that I order it--they are my favorites! 
__label__pos	And the smile helps with therapy. It's great.
__label__pos	First of all, I thought the steering wheel was cute. 
__label__pos	It was advertised as having flashing lights & music, and it looked cute from the box.
__label__neg	BUT, no one can get to let alone change the battery, the seat has tiny plastic pieces that slide into place to hold it in, and they don't really want to stay that way. 
__label__neg	The flashing lights didn't work, then did, and now they don't, and we just bought this yesterday. 
__label__neu	For the brief what, 3 minutes the lights started working. 
__label__neg	The music was loud and painful. 
__label__neg	The lights feature is 2 small red flashing lights on the steering wheel. 
__label__neg	*so disappointed.
__label__neg	It isn't designed well, and it doesn't function properly. 
__label__neu	It can actually be used as a walker, and it is cute, but we are certainly taking this back.
__label__neu	I can't say enough about the Diaper Dekor Plus system.  
__label__pos	It truly holds as many diapers ODOR free as they say it does.  
__label__neu	Our son is 3 months old and we've only just opened a second bag a couple of weeks ago!  (Each box of refills contains 3 bags, but they include one bag when you purchase the Diaper Dekor Plus.
__label__pos	)  At the rate we are going, we won't need to open another box of refills until close to his 6 month birthday.Don't let the price tag worry you - it's WELL worth the price because there is absolutely no odor.  
__label__neu	With two dogs in the house, we worried that the diaper can would become a hunting ground, but they haven't shown the least bit of interest.  
__label__pos	The bag is a cinch to dispose of, and I LOVE how you can cut it off at any point you want.  
__label__pos	In the long run, the refills are much cheaper than the other brands and it's well worth the money to not have to waste your time on flimsy grocery-store bags - they simply can't contain the stink - find another use for them - line your other waste pails with them.  Diapers need special attention, and the Diaper Dekor Plus fits the bill!I HIGHLY recommend this stylish, practical and cost-effective disposal system!
__label__pos	We felt like overprotective first time parents when we purchased this monitor, but are so happy that we did.  
__label__pos	It is great to be able to see our little guy without having to go into his room and potentially wake him up.  
__label__neu	He makes lots of noise while he sleeps, so a quick glance at the monitor lets us know if he needs us or is just being his typically loud-sleeping self.
__label__pos	The range is excellent.  
__label__neu	Our bedrooms and the baby's nursery are on the 3rd floor of our 5000 sq ft house.  
__label__neu	We still get reception when on the 1st floor at the opposite end of the house.  
__label__pos	We also get reception in most of our yard.
__label__pos	The video quality is great.  
__label__pos	It's actually easier to see the baby with the monitor than in person at night.
__label__pos	We didn't think we'd have much use for this monitor until our baby was older and able to scoot around in his crib, but we've enjoyed it since moving our baby into his nursery.  
__label__pos	Highly recommended.
__label__pos	We bought as an extra base for our other car and makes it easier for us to use whichever car to take our daughter without having to move car seat base.  
__label__pos	With the LATCH option makes it easy to remove as well if we need to.
__label__pos	These were by far my sons favorite bottles.  
__label__pos	He had very little gas, he adapted to the nipple VERY  easily, and they are easy for him to hold now that he's older.  
__label__pos	Very simply, Put these on your registry, you won't be sorry.
__label__pos	Newborns can be so wriggly &amp; this product was a great help at bath-time! 
__label__neu	Especially for 1st time parents!  
__label__pos	The design holds baby in place &amp; our 1 month old (who is almost rolling over already) stays put during bathing!  
__label__neu	The only change to this product I'd recommend is a foam liner where baby sits/lies.  
__label__neu	I went to a craft store &amp; bought some for cheap &amp; installed it myself (used a towel as a 'liner' the first 2 baths).  
__label__neu	Also, it is quite large for counter-top use but we made it work in our master bathroom, too big for the kitchen.  
__label__pos	Really a nice product, helped me feel more comfortable about bathing a newborn!
__label__pos	Update at 4.5 months age:  I stand by my statement above in that this is a great product - IF you use it.  
__label__neu	I have taken baby into the bath with me more often &amp; Daddy helps to dry him off when we are done.
__label__pos	Update at 7 mos (July04): Using more now that he is bigger &amp; harder to take to the tub with me (wants to crawl in the water).  
__label__neu	Still would have liked for a layer of foam against the back, as said above I did my own!
__label__pos	My boy loved this rocker from about 1.5 months to about 6 months, when he had pretty much outgrown it.  
__label__pos	During those 4.5 months he always had a great time playing in it -- and it worked really, really well to induce him to poop.  
__label__pos	So every time we wanted him to do the dirty deed, we just put him there and almost invariably he would move his bowels as he played with the toys or sucked on his fingers.  
__label__pos	This was also easy to take to parks, etc. and the cloth cover is easy to take off for washing.  
__label__pos	We recommend this to all new parents.
__label__neu	When I went back to work after 5+ months of maternity leave, my baby had no interest in drinking from a bottle. 
__label__neu	The babysitter had to spoon feed milk to her. 
__label__neu	I tried almost every other bottle and nipple on the market except for the Adiri Breastbottle Nurser - Baby Bottle. 
__label__neg	The babysitter discovered that she preferred rubber nipples over silicon ones because they are softer, but she didn't like the shape of other brands, so it was still a struggle to try to get her to drink from a bottle during the day. 
__label__neu	I was so worried about my baby until I finally found thePlaytex Bottle 4-oz. Drop-Ins - 100-ct.. 
__label__pos	The nipple is very wide and shaped more naturally than other bottles. 
__label__pos	I replaced the silicon nipples that are included with the bottles with this rubber nipple and she finally drinks from the bottle and still breastfeeds whenever I am home. 
__label__pos	The drop-in bags turned out to be a great benefit of the bottles also. 
__label__pos	And because the bottle is lightweight and has a hollow bottom, my baby can easily hold the bottle to drink by herself.
__label__pos	This is a great carrier that is well worth the extra money it costs.  
__label__pos	It is extremely user-friendly.  
__label__neu	You don't have to have 5 arms or be a contortionist to use it like you do with some of the cheaper carriers.  
__label__neu	You can wear this carrier with the baby facing you or facing out.  
__label__neu	However, it cannot be worn on your back like some carriers can.  
__label__pos	My son loves this carrier.  
__label__neu	I generally wear him in it around the house when I am trying to get things done and for short outings.  
__label__neu	If I am going to be out for a while, I usually put him in the stroller b/c I find that to be more convenient.  
__label__neg	My only problem is that now that he is almost 20 pounds it really weighs down on my shoulders and if I carry him in it for too long I am really sore.  
__label__neu	However, it doesn't seem to bother my husband as much.  
__label__pos	I had to wash it recently for the first time b/c my son spit up all over it and it held up great in the wash.  
__label__pos	It is a very stylish, sturdy carrier that couldn't be easier to use.  
__label__pos	It is an excellent choice.
__label__pos	Baby has enjoyed this consistently from age 2mo. to 6mo. 
__label__pos	It soothes when you bounce it and baby really responds to the musical moving bar - so did I when I saw it in the store! 
__label__pos	It is also the perfect angle for Dad to feed baby while laying on the couch watching football. 
__label__neu	Hmm. 
__label__pos	Cover is easy to clean, just pop it off. 
__label__neu	One note, sometimes you have to adjust the cover a bit or the vibrating box rattles, and DO NOT try to move it once baby is in it - the wire frame is not balanced at all except when on the ground.
__label__pos	Love this. 
__label__pos	it is larger than you think it would be. 
__label__neu	It barks when you push on the nose. 
__label__pos	I think it is so cute.
__label__neu	I bought the gate because of its angle mount feature.
__label__neu	I have an unusual baseboard and my wall and banister are not aligned.
__label__neu	It arrived without its template(parts A&B)and i decided not to install without them.
__label__pos	When they eventually arrived(1 week later)they proved to be quite useful during installation.
__label__neu	Contrary to the reviews i read the installation was easy and straight forward.
__label__neg	However the problem i had was assembling the two gate frames together with the locking parts,the instructions were not explicit enough.
__label__pos	Though once you figure that out everything else is okay.
__label__pos	Overall a solid and well designed gate but frustrating to assemble.
__label__pos	I love this idea and  so does my son. 
__label__pos	He had his first local gorn apple at 5 months old thanks to this product. 
__label__neu	He gnawed that thing to death. 
__label__neu	We keep one at home and oone in the diaper bag for when we got out. 
__label__pos	It is easy to clean and is one less thing to worry about. 
__label__pos	Of course supervision is still required but makes you feel safer knowing the baby is eating healthy food and staying safe from choking.
__label__neu	I attached this to my grandchild's rainforest bouncer when the batteries ran out.  
__label__pos	She loved it as much as the waterfall and monkeys.  
__label__pos	When she discovered that pulling the bird made the fan go around, she is very intrigued.  
__label__pos	The happy sun prism glows in the sunlight, and this toy always brings a smile to her face.
__label__pos	I love that you can attach it to anything.
__label__neg	We unfortunately bought this before reading the reviews.
__label__neg	We followed the directions perfectly and it fell off within 10 hours.  
__label__neu	So we are going to try what another reviewer said, double sided sticky tape and see if that works.  
__label__neu	If not we will be returning it which is really a shame because it's really cute and a big space saver for our small bathroom.  
__label__neg	They should really work on a design to make it stick better!
__label__neg	Update: We tried the sticky tape and it stayed for about a week and fell again.  
__label__neg	So we took it back.
__label__neu	I choose this over the hospital pump. 
__label__neu	At first I could not get any suction, but you have to use the thing right to get any!!! 
__label__pos	After I realized a part was on wrong I would not leave the house without it. 
__label__pos	This pump is the best!!!! 
__label__pos	I was pumping so much milk out by day 4 (after delivery) that our son is now 4 months old and we still have tons of frozen milk in the fridge. 
__label__pos	The pump is easy to use, has a comfy grip, and small to carry around. 
__label__neu	Also very few parts, although one part is very very small and is a hassel to keep track of. 
__label__pos	We were going to buy an electric breast pump once out of the hospital but once I started using the Isis I wanted to spend the money on other things that I needed.
__label__neu	I spent a lot of time looking at baby products.  
__label__pos	Overall this was the best looking swing I could find.  
__label__pos	It is wonderful. 
__label__pos	Fairly easy to put together.  
__label__neg	Runs on 4 D batteries, which it does seem to go through quickly.  
__label__neu	But as my friends say, my baby lives in her swing.
__label__pos	It has two different swinging positions, both of which my baby likes.  
__label__neu	It has two seat positions.  
__label__neu	I tried the sitting up position with her at two and a half months and she she likes it, though she doesn't seem to sleep well that way.
__label__pos	If nothing else makes her happy her swing will.  
__label__pos	This swing is wonderful and if I could give more than five stars I would.  
__label__pos	The controls are easy to use.  
__label__pos	It does not make any noise if set up right.
__label__pos	After my husband figured out how to place it, we realized this was a great product! 
__label__pos	We love the idea of having the key so the child cannot get into the cabinet. 
__label__pos	So far, it works perfectly and our 10 month old is not able to get into the cabinets now
__label__pos	It is really a great idea this speepSack. 
__label__pos	I do not have to worry of SIDS with my newborn. 
__label__pos	I really recommend this product.
__label__neu	We had to buy this in a hurry because the product we had wanted (and ordered from Amazon) suddenly became unavailable.  
__label__neg	What a poor choice!  
__label__neg	The back panel is not even the right _size_, so there's a gaping hole in the back of the dresser.  
__label__neu	Tells you a lot about the manufacturer's quality control.  
__label__neg	The whole thing feels flimsy and cheap.  
__label__neg	I'd be worried about putting a baby on top of it, it feels ready to fall apart at any minute.  
__label__neg	My husband put a dent into this thing with his _nail_ -- exactly what is it made out of?
__label__neg	I wish I had known that it was made of this kind of cheap stuff, it certainly shouldn't be for the price of it.  
__label__neg	Bottom line -- waste of money.
__label__neu	We registered and recieved the Baby Einstein Center thinking that we were getting the most edicational product for our child--atleast for stationary entertainers.  
__label__neg	We were wrong.  
__label__neg	You can't understand the spanish and quite frankly it is boring.  
__label__pos	A friend had bought the Exersaucer (new model) for her son and my daughter fell in love with it (even at 4 months).  
__label__neu	So, we packed up the Baby Einstein and took it back and came home with the Exersaucer.  Yes it is more money, but it is also more fun and you can buy different toys to stitch in and out.  
__label__pos	Invest in fun---being a kid is not all learning spanish and english but also learning what fun is as well as cause and effect!!
__label__pos	This is the best for me. 
__label__pos	It is very simple to use, even when you are a first mum and are giving baby his first bath, and convenient according to baby's age.
__label__neu	I bought these bowls expecting them to end the food-dumping behavior that so many are complaining about.  
__label__neu	The reviews are correct - they won't help with that.  
__label__neg	The suction is not strong enough.  
__label__pos	But what they are good for is helping a child who is learning to self-feed master spoon-related skill without having to worry about the bowl moving around.  
__label__pos	They're really good when your child is self-feeding cold cereal, applesauce, oatmeal, etc.  
__label__neu	A smart buy, but will come in handy a little later than you might think.
__label__pos	One more thing - the suction is greatly improved if you lick the bottom of the bowl before you stick it to the table.  
__label__pos	Unfortunately this lead to a period when my son felt it was customary to lick things before putting them on the table, but this passed quickly.
__label__neu	It's impossible to avoid things made in China.  
__label__neu	I don't like it either, but Thermos has been around for years, and has a long standing reputation for making good products.
__label__neu	After trying just about every single BPA free sippy on the market, I finally bit the bullet and bought a Foogo.  
__label__neg	One thing I will say about this, is that it's really heavy for a baby.  
__label__neg	I bought one when my son was about 9 months old and he wasn't able to hold it at that point, so I had to hold it for him.  
__label__pos	I was also worried about the valve system, as he had a hard time using cups with valves, but he took to this sippy cup fabulously, and will not use any other cup.
__label__neu	A word about leaks.  
__label__neu	This cup?  
__label__neu	Should not leak.  
__label__neu	The parts should come apart easily.  
__label__pos	We've never had a problem, and any time I've experienced a leak, I've been able to troubleshoot the problem by taking the lid off and usually, it was an issue of the valve not being snapped in all the way.  
__label__neu	There is a point at which a small bit of water pools in between the valve and the spout, but it's minimal, and not enough to soak your entire living room.
__label__pos	I love the entire Foogo line.  
__label__pos	They're durable, and they hold temperature for a long time.
__label__neu	If your child moves around in the bed and you don't have this positioned exactly where they are they will miss.  
__label__neg	And it doesn't secure to the bed that well.  
__label__neg	I would look for something bigger and something that fits the entire bed, not just a small section.  
__label__neg	I'll probably trash it and get a better one, I don't want to risk ruining my bed if my 3 year old misses the pad.
__label__neg	!00% would not recommend it.
__label__neu	I'm a carrier addict and recently (reluctantly) added an Ergo to my collection.  
__label__neu	I own a ring sling, Moby, Babyhawk Mei Tai, and an Ergo.  
__label__pos	The Babyhawk and the Ergo are by far my favorites.  
__label__pos	I tried the Ergo on in a local boutique and was so impressed.  
__label__pos	It made my 20 pound 4 month old feel nearly 10 pounds lighter as soon as I strapped him in.  
__label__pos	I really love the Ergo's design - it's easy to use, sturdy, and the pull-up hood is a fantastic feature.  
__label__neu	But the main reason I decided to buy the Ergo is it's lack of dangling staps.  
__label__neu	I live in Seattle and didn't like the way the straps of my Babyhawk would drag on the muddy ground while I was trying to put it on outdoors in parking lots, etc.  
__label__pos	With the Ergo, nothing ever touches the ground so I knew I had to have one once the rainy season started to hit.  
__label__pos	Overall, I still prefer my Babyhawk because it's much quicker to get on and I loved getting to completely customize all the fabric choices and features on their website.  
__label__neu	Don't get me wrong, the Ergo is super easy - but coming down from the BabyHawk, all the straps and adjustments that have to be made each time you put it on can seem a bit cumbersome.  
__label__neg	Hence the 1 star deduction.  
__label__pos	Still, worth every cent I paid for it!
__label__pos	This is my son's second favorite toy.  
__label__pos	(His absolute favorite is ScratchEurope's Chicken Ball.)  
__label__pos	Sophie is the more portable toy, though, and a good shape and size to be tucked into my purse, the diaper bag, the baby sling, wherever..  
__label__neu	The boy is at that stage where *everything* goes in his mouth - including lots of things I'd prefer didn't.  
__label__neu	However, whenever he goes for something he shouldn't have he can always be distracted away by Sophie.  
__label__pos	She's just that good for little mouths.  
__label__pos	A++ times a million.
__label__neu	Trust me they figure out how to get them out of the outlets.  
__label__neu	Get the old fashion one that us parents have a hard time getting out.
__label__pos	I really love this cover for my BabyBjorn carrier. 
__label__neu	I have owned my carrier for more than 6 years and it has been through 3 children. 
__label__neu	Now with my son, I decided to try the carrier cover instead of wrapping blankets around the baby carrier, which is what I did previously if the weather was cold. 
__label__pos	This cover is so much easier to use than blankets. 
__label__pos	You literally can put your baby in the carrier, attach the cover and go. 
__label__pos	You don't even need a hat-there is a detachable hood. 
__label__pos	I recommend this product highly!
__label__neu	We recieved this as a gift for my one year old son after the original aquarium broke.  
__label__pos	Even though my 1 year old likes it, my 4 year old loves it even more.  
__label__pos	Since they share a room, this soothes both of them to sleep but if my younger one falls asleep before the older one, the older one gets up and turns this on to watch the ceiling show.  
__label__pos	The projection is very clear and the music is nice.  
__label__neu	My 1 year old turns this on himself to hear the music and watch the birds move around.  
__label__pos	And after my son outgrows this as a crib toy, I can use it on a table in their room so they can still enjoy it.  
__label__pos	I think this is even better than the original (2001) fisher price aquarium since the image on the ceiling is better and the birds are so cute.
__label__pos	Easy to use, easy to clean, cheaper to use, not bad-looking either. 
__label__pos	Any plastic shopping bag will work in this diaper pail. 
__label__neg	The only con is that it can be tough to open until you get the hang of it. 
__label__pos	But it will certainly be an even greater challenge for your child to open!
__label__pos	It works very well in my 35 story 2K apartment complex in the middle Manhattan. 
__label__neg	However it was picking up a lot of interference in a semi deserted mountain retreat in NJ.  
__label__neu	Go figure...
__label__neg	What a disappointment!  
__label__pos	We were so grateful to receive this at a baby shower- it was something we really wanted.  
__label__neg	However, it did not live up to expectations.  
__label__neg	The sound quality was awful- very, very quiet even on the highest volume setting and, even worse, extreme static.  
__label__neg	I exchanged it for another one thinking that maybe the first was defective but had the same problems.  
__label__neg	For such an expensive item the quality is very poor.
__label__neu	We ended up ordering the Fisher Price Tape Player online and it is really wonderful.  
__label__pos	We love it- buy it instead, better quality and cheaper!
__label__neu	Got this Graco IPO umbrella stroller for my 20 mo old baby. 
__label__pos	He seems quit content in it and hasn't complained. 
__label__neu	"After having 3 Maclaren strollers (techno, triumph and rally twin), I can say: cons are that this stroller is smaller and heavier, narrower than the maclaren, the sunshade is not that good b/c it doesn't cover all that much, the seatback is short (my son's head bulges out the fabric when he lays down) not an issue on the maclaren, the foam handles are kinda rough, the locking latch is manually done, not automatic like the Mac does, and I have to try not kick the back of the wheels with my long stride (although I am only 5' 4"" and never an issue on the Mac).... "
__label__pos	the pro's is the folding mechanism is quite easy to use, but you have to bend down to do it, the basket is fully lined (the Mac is mesh), the 5 pt harness is easier to adjust, the price is much lower (got my IPO on sale for $53), the stroller is rides smooth and pushes easily with one hand if needed and the recline strap is easy to use. 
__label__neu	I think for the money it's a good choice, but overall I think Maclaren wins for umbrella strollers (if you have the extra money to put out for one).
__label__pos	This monitor is fantastic. 
__label__pos	The picture is very clear, even in the dark, and the sound is super sensitive. 
__label__pos	The battery lasts a long time, and after almost 2 years of daily use it is still working perfect and we have had zero problems with it. 
__label__pos	Every once in a while we'll get a tad bit of static, but the house is pretty big, so it's expected. 
__label__pos	This was definitely worth the money.
__label__pos	This tub is incredible for a newborn. 
__label__pos	It's non-skid surface really helps hold baby in place, and it's size makes it very easy to bathe your baby. 
__label__pos	It folds up nicely & we stored it under the bathroom sink. 
__label__neu	However, after a couple of months, we moved our daughter into a bigger tub so that she could kick her feet & move around more. 
__label__pos	I will definitely use this tub again for our next newborn!
__label__pos	These are so great especially at times of daddy-changing-the-baby-when-pooped.
__label__neu	Before I started to use these I'd get to wash the changing pad cover after each time my husband gets to change our son when he pooped, not to mention the clothes of both my baby AND my husband.
__label__pos	So if you have the same situation - these are the laundrysaver :))
__label__pos	This is sturdy, easy to use, easy to find things in (versus the hanging stroller bags).  
__label__pos	Buy it - you won't regret it!
__label__neu	[...]  
__label__pos	It is absolutely perfect!  
__label__neu	The cubby consists of a cute underwater background of bubbles with multicolored fish, whale, and alligator and strong plastic suction cups on the outside.  
__label__pos	The front and bottom is solid mesh so that water can drain and no mildew grows.  
__label__pos	The suction cups on it are very thick and stick quite well to my tile.  
__label__pos	There is more than enough room for all of his foam letters and other bath toys.  
__label__pos	I like that since it sits on the top corner of the tub, my son can reach in it on his own and grab the toys he wants out of it.  
__label__pos	I no longer have to worry about having bath toys all over the bathroom!  
__label__pos	I highly recommend this for anyone with a tile bathroom, (with a corner) who has a need for storage of many many bath toys!!  
__label__neg	If you do not have corners in your bathroom, don't bother with this because it will not work with rounded off tub/showers.
__label__pos	I love this stroller sun shade! 
__label__pos	We live on a tropical island that gets loads of sun and the Kiddopatamus sun shade is perfect for keeping my little man out of the sun. 
__label__neu	I have read some reviews where people complain about the sun shade not fairing well in the wind but I have not had that problem. 
__label__neg	My only gripe is that the sun shade is only 100% effective when the sun is pretty much directly overhead. 
__label__neu	If the sun is at an angle my son does end up getting some sun but it's still less than if we did not have the sun shade. 
__label__pos	When I'm walking in the morning or in the evening when the sun is at an angle I simply pull the sun shade down and readjust it - the velcro straps are pretty long so you can make it fit no matter how you have to tweek it. 
__label__pos	Overall a super product that I would recommend anyone purchase! 
__label__pos	Well worth the money!
__label__neu	Tummy time was a nightmare for my daughter from the beginning.  
__label__pos	This toy made it a little better though.  
__label__pos	She loves looking at the colorful tentacles and listening to the upbeat songs.  
__label__pos	She is over 6 months now, so she doesn't play with it as much, but it always brings a smile when we bring it out!
__label__neu	I Only rate this item 4 Stars because I just purchased it today.  
__label__pos	It was very simple to assemble, I didnt even need my husband for help.  
__label__neu	We purchased this gate because of the great reviews and also because I have 2 70lbs Terriers that need to start getting used to being guarded off.  
__label__pos	Although Im only 6 months pregnant I know this gate is going to work out great for our dogs when our baby is here.  
__label__neu	We've had it up all day and the dogs jump on it with no problem.  
__label__pos	The gate is sturdy comfy and attractive as well which is important in my house, most of all seems very safe. 
__label__pos	I highly recommend this product for all parent who have dogs in their house no matter what size they are.
__label__neu	I would be giving it 5 stars if I had this gate longer,  but couldnt wait to post the great review after purchasing it and seeing how great my dogs are adapting to it.
__label__pos	This item is absolutely wonderful!!!  
__label__pos	My daughter is now 8 weeks old and we have been using this in her crib since birth.  
__label__pos	"I can lay her down in her crib when she is on the verge of falling asleep and I turn on the ""what does the world look like"" story and she falls asleep before it is finished.  "
__label__pos	She loves the Twinkle Twinkle little star song and we often play it while I am changing her.  
__label__pos	I highly recommend this to every parent! 
__label__neu	It does use up a lot of batteries so keep extra on hand, but it is worth it!!!
__label__pos	I have used this for 11 months and I love it. 
__label__neu	What we did was after the baby started having odor in his #2s we bought some of those diaper bags from dollar tree (100 for $1) and put the dirty diapers in those little bags. 
__label__pos	So easy! 
__label__pos	Never an odor problem. 
__label__pos	And I use regular kitchen garbage bags in it, so no special bags to buy.
__label__pos	I did research when I was registering before the baby and looked at all of the other diaper pails and this one was the one that came out ahead. 
__label__pos	I am glad I researched it because I am very happy with it!
__label__neu	For starters, we actually found this at a Marshall's store near us for only $34.99, so, we couldn't pass it up!
__label__neu	Our son was born a day before a major snow storm in NJ, and we had this ready to go in the car seat the day we left the hospital. 
__label__pos	Let me just say it has been wonderful!! Ever since he was born, our baby has kept snuggly warm when being transported from car to house and anywhere else we brought him in the car seat. 
__label__pos	I, too, have seen no problem with the seat belt laying funny, not sure what that one reviewer was talking about.
__label__pos	When we take him out of the car into the elements, we zip it up all the way and use the loose flap at the top to hold up with the car seat handle, so he is covered and protected from wind/snow/rain, but not smothered. 
__label__pos	He never wakes up from being cold.
__label__pos	It also is a great neutral color (we have the graphite), which matches our grey/blue car seat perfectly!
__label__pos	I look forward to using this throughout the rest of the winter. 
__label__pos	It is a great buy, I'm so glad we found it.
__label__neu	I was skeptical about using this because my daughter hated the sleepsack as a younger baby.  
__label__neu	She refuses any sleeping attire or blanket that covers her feet.  
__label__neg	She was resistant to this at first, and I had to carefully put it on after she was asleep. 
__label__pos	"A couple weeks later and now she is very happy with it, and putting on her ""sleepy coat"" is part of her bedtime ritual.  "
__label__pos	She can keep warm and see that her feet are still there.  
__label__neu	My only complaint is that the foot-holes need to be just slightly bigger to fit over the sweats she likes to sleep in, but other than that is the answer to her waking up cold at night.  
__label__neu	I
__label__pos	Not just for babies since this is a great intercom system.  
__label__pos	Love that you can run everything over the small protable parental device. 
__label__pos	For those families like ours with health issues including allergies the humidity and temperature sensors are a definate plus. 
__label__pos	With a child with severe anxiety, being alone and sleeping issues, the Two way intercom communication has been a blessing. 
__label__pos	My son age 9 is now able to feel safe and secure in his own room.
__label__pos	With regards to the reach, we have no problems. 
__label__pos	In our large 4500 square foot home, sound quality functions at every place and also in the garden everywhere outside without high-class loss. 
__label__pos	For us this has been a very worthwhile item. 
__label__pos	We would buy this again, even at the current price.
__label__pos	I own this one in green and love it. 
__label__pos	It actually SAVES my back from carrying my daughter a lot. 
__label__neu	I have a colicky baby so that I can hardly put her down. 
__label__pos	It's really comfortable for my child and I and SO easy to use even it looks complicated. It only takes me seconds to put it on. 
__label__neu	When my daughter was under 3 months old, it was a little bit big for her (her head flopped way back in a very uncomfortable position. 
__label__neu	I had to use the Original style instead). 
__label__pos	Now when she is older and heavier, this one is the perfect carrier. 
__label__pos	I absolutely recommend this style for bigger infants, not newborn though.
__label__neu	The first time you use the tray, it seems to work great - until the tray is pulled off. 
__label__neg	The tabs that 'lock' the tray onto the front piece strip out way too easily and the tray is pretty useless at that point. 
__label__neg	They need to have a better design to lock the tray into place.
__label__neg	In other words, a total waste of money. 
__label__neg	The entire purpose was to have a surface to place toys and other things on, but when the tray keeps falling off, you may as well just place your items in baby's lap.
__label__neg	These cloth diapers are reasonably priced and include a padded middle.  
__label__neu	They should do the trick for those using cloth diapers.  
__label__neu	They also work as burp cloths for those using disposable diapers.
__label__pos	We loved this product.
__label__neu	We started using this when we came home from the hsopital.
__label__pos	Our son preferred it to the airflow positioner. 
__label__pos	The incline was just enough to help with our son's reflux problem so he wouldn't be laying flat after eating. 
__label__neu	I placed a lap pad in it as recommended by a friend, so if it became soiled, I could easily replace the lap pad instead of trying to wash the positioner itself.
__label__pos	Our son is three months old, and still loves it.
__label__pos	So pretty!  
__label__pos	and lots for a baby to do.  
__label__neu	One thing though... 
__label__neg	I do wish it had something that lit up and a little music.  
__label__pos	But still very pretty!
__label__neu	I read the reviews on this product before buying it.  
__label__neu	It seems it worked for some wonderfully and not so great for others or not at all.  
__label__pos	The sound worked great but I could never get a picture at all.  
__label__neu	I took it back to the store and they said certain brands dont work in certain homes.  
__label__neu	I thought about exchanging it for another just like it but figured it wouldnt work.  
__label__pos	I saw the safety first one and it was slightly higher in price but i knew my other regular monitor was safety first and it worked so I bought it and got it home and it worked fine.  
__label__neu	If you want this monitor I suggest trying it out for yourself in your home instead of just reading these reviews because it does depend on how your house is set up just dont get your hopes up and be prepared to run back to the store to exchange just in case.
__label__pos	I love this potty seat. 
__label__pos	My son loves it and it worked great for introducing him to the potty. 
__label__pos	We used this ducka from the beginning and didn't have to use a separate potty. 
__label__neu	The head blocks most accidents for boys. 
__label__pos	It has held up well and is easy to clean. 
__label__neu	The only thing that has not held up is the hook but that is because my son pulled on it while it was hanging on a hook. 
__label__neu	I would say if you are planning on hanging it then hang it from a wide hook that is low enough that your child will not try to pull down on it. 
__label__pos	I love that this duck is cute but blends in nicely to bathroom decor.
__label__neu	I am a Family Childcare Provider in Massassachusetts. 
__label__neu	I have 3 children sleeping in cribs and have purchased many crib sheets. 
__label__neg	Some don't fit the crib mattress correctly and the kids are able to pull them off in no time (2 year old)... 
__label__pos	These sheets have nice wide pockets for covering the mattress completely. 
__label__pos	Easy to change and vibrant colors to boot... 
__label__pos	A very good purchase...
__label__neg	My dog ended up with this pillow because it was so horrible. 
__label__neu	Yes, I literally tossed it to the dogs!  
__label__neu	Not at all supportive where it counts.  
__label__neu	Flat.  
__label__neg	The contoured shape just made it awkward to deal with.  
__label__neg	The other person is right, it does not live up to the Boppy name.  
__label__neu	They need to quit making this pillow.
__label__neu	Just go buy a normal body pillow.  
__label__neu	Or better yet, buy about 9 regular pillows, that way you can stuff them wherever you need.  
__label__neu	That's what you will end up doing anyway, I promise!
__label__pos	I love all the Dr. Brown's bottles.
__label__neu	My son has never had any problems with colic, excessive spit up or gas. 
__label__neu	I attribute this to these bottles. 
__label__pos	He was even great on these when switching between bottle and breast - no problems. 
__label__neu	When I had to use other bottles in a pinch, he wasn't happy eating.
__label__neu	Our microwave is too small to warm the standard 8 ounce in. 
__label__pos	The wide neck, 8 ounce bottles are perfect. 
__label__neu	They achieve exactly what I need them to in all areas.
__label__neu	The only cons about Dr. Brown's bottles are that our son has a hard time feeding from any other bottle. 
__label__neu	This bottle is so effective that on the occasions he has used different bottles, he didn't know to let go to let air fill up the bottom of the bottle. 
__label__neu	It was frustrating, and we had to keep breaking the seal in his mouth for him. If you're going to use Dr. Brown's, stick to these bottles only. 
__label__neu	Also, the nipple on the wide neck is different from standard, and it takes baby a few feedings with the new nipple to get used to it. 
__label__neu	Additionally, if any of the Dr. Brown's bottles are not assembled correctly and the collar isn't on tight enough they will leak. 
__label__pos	There are additional parts that need to be cleaned, but its well worth it!
__label__pos	I'd never buy another brand!
__label__pos	This works great. 
__label__neu	Wash your bottles and put them in this sterilizer. 
__label__neu	Put 7 oz of water and pop it in the microwave for 4 minutes and your done! 
__label__neu	If you follow the instruction you can only fit 4 bottles, but I have been able to fit 5.
__label__pos	Not all babies need their bottles sterilize but if you want to be safe than sorry this is an awesome product!
__label__pos	I love this pitcher so much that I bought two.  
__label__neu	They mix how ever much formula you need quickly and easily.  
__label__neu	It is extremely easy to fill with water, add formula, mix and then toss the pitcher in the fridge - it takes about a minute.  
__label__neu	Since formula keeps for 24 hours you can make a day's worth and then portion it out however you need it through out the day.  
__label__pos	The best part is that at the end of the day you can just toss the whole thing in the dishwasher.  
__label__neu	The directions say you need to disassemble the lid, but I've found that it gets perfectly clean if you leave it assembled.
__label__neu	We use Nestle Good Start with Active cultures which can sometimes have lumps.  
__label__pos	The mixing mechanism in this pitcher has eliminated all of the lumps in the formula and has made the whole bottle feeding experience MUCH easier.
__label__neu	It broke in 3 different parts within the first week. 
__label__neg	The wood is very weak and breaks very easily.  
__label__neg	This doesn't do well for a toddler... 
__label__neu	they need to make it with real wood or stronger material!
__label__neu	I did my fair share of research when I decided to buy a new swing. 
__label__neu	This one was surprisingly one of the cheapest and also had all the features I was looking for. 
__label__pos	The thing I like the most is the light show, which keeps my baby's attention. 
__label__pos	Another great thing about this swing is that it plugs into the wall so I dont have to buy batteries all the time. 
__label__neu	You can also switch it to battery power if you want to take it outside or something. 
__label__pos	The mobile is cute and the sounds are soothing. 
__label__pos	My 18 month old and 3 year old love to play with it also. 
__label__neu	The volume control is also handy, I turn the volume up when he is just sitting there to keep him entertained; and I turn the volume down lower when I want him to go to sleep.
__label__neu	I saw a lot of complaints about the color. 
__label__neu	The checkered parts of the swing do look more purple than blue, but in my opinion it is not overdone. 
__label__pos	This swing is perfect for a boy or girl.
__label__pos	My daughter is two months old and I just discovered these great bottles. 
__label__neu	I was a die-hard Avent user. 
__label__neu	I used them with my older daughter, now 7, and used them with my baby born in March. 
__label__neu	While the Avent system is good, I love the presterilized drop-in disposable liners.
__label__neu	Now I have minimal clean up and I only have to sterilize the nipples, rings and tops!!! 
__label__pos	This is such a great find. 
__label__neu	I have completely replaced all of our Avent bottles with the Playtex Nursers. 
__label__pos	The drop-in refills are very inexpensive and are more than worth the money in the time it saves.
__label__pos	We love the Svan chair (see my review posted under its listing), and we love this cushion!
__label__pos	I got the Sage color and it really looks much better in person (fortunately).
__label__pos	It fits the chair very snugly, feels soft and nice, and looks classy.
__label__pos	Plus, I've found it very easy to clean.
__label__neu	So far, I've just wiped it down, but it's machine washable in case we ever have a messy incident.
__label__pos	But the most important reviewer is my 7-month-old -- he loves it and smiles every time we strap him in.
__label__pos	If you get the chair, spring for the cushion. You won't regret it.
__label__pos	My son loves this toy! 
__label__pos	We have a bunch of teether toys but this is by far his favorite. 
__label__pos	It's easy for him to hold and easy for me to clean. 
__label__pos	Would definitely recommend!
__label__neu	We currently live in housing on base in Germany and the stairs are very wide and unusual. 
__label__neu	I got this gate since it is made for the top of the stairs and was wide enough for our staircase. 
__label__pos	It works great! 
__label__pos	I love that it slides to the side as well as opens. 
__label__pos	Was a breeze to install and I feel really safe with the fact that it is a really great hardware mount. 
__label__pos	No complaints here my son is 10 months and pulls up on everything so it is nice to know he is safe! 
__label__pos	The one hand open is really simple and I like it more than any gate I have seen at friends houses.
__label__neu	Anyone who has a small baby during cool weather needs one of these. 
__label__neu	I wasnt sure if I would use it but since I put it on, it hasnt come off. 
__label__pos	It is so warm and easy to use. 
__label__neu	I just buckle in my daughter and then zip her up and off we go. 
__label__pos	I love the color cause it matches our travel system(Graco Quattro-Mocha) and the head support fits inside the bundle me so she still has head support. 
__label__pos	Its great and I HIGHLY reccomend it!
__label__neu	I have two of these dishwasher baskets, but I do not have the valve basket. 
__label__neu	They can be purchased separately at some stores. 
__label__neu	I originally bought another type of dishwasher basket that had the bottle nipple compartment on top, but it much more difficult to use. 
__label__neu	Everytime you opened it to add another nipple, the ones already in there would fall out. 
__label__pos	These dishwasher baskets are designed allot better. 
__label__neu	They have the nipple compartment on the bottom for better cleaning and have slots that the bottle nipples fit into. 
__label__pos	The best aspect, however, is that the nipples do not fall out when the compartment is opened.
__label__pos	Several reviews complain about features of this warmer, but I think it is wonderful.  
__label__neu	I use Avent bottles and Gerber baby food jars in it with no problems.  
__label__neu	If you put the bottle/jar in the warmer first and then add the water, the bottle/jar will not float or tip over.  I
__label__neu	t has three heat settings for how warm you want your bottle and a red light on the front shows when the bottle is warming.  
__label__neu	The light shuts off when done, but if you leave the warmer on, it will heat through another cycle.  
__label__neu	It heats so quickly though, that you don't have time to get distracted and leave the bottle to get too hot.  
__label__neu	Even if it had auto shut-off, a bottle left in hot water will continue to heat and could be too warm to serve to your baby.  
__label__neu	It uses a coil to heat and I've heard that these type of heating mechanisms should be unplugged when not in use so that they won't get ruined, but there is an ON/OFF switch on the back of the warmer if you'd rather just use that.  
__label__pos	The basket inside is removeable and makes it easy to pull out 2.5 ounce baby food jars.  
__label__pos	The warmer is small, convenient and easy to clean.  
__label__pos	I am very happy with it.
__label__neu	I couldn't get my baby to latch at all during first 24 hrs of birth. 
__label__neu	All the nurses tried to help and he'd get on for maybe 2 seconds, we have multiple nursing lactation consultants come in to help and they had no luck. 
__label__neu	Finally after 24 hrs one of them recommended this because my poor baby was frustrated and starving.
__label__neu	One of my nipples is still sore but that's because of how I am putting him on I think because my other one I can barely feel now when he's on and he's almost 2 weeks old.  
__label__neu	I used lanolin on the sore one and it's not so bad when I get him at the right angle.
__label__pos	This is really easy to clean to. 
__label__neu	Between feedings just wash with little soap and warm/hot water then I keep it in a sealed bowl near my bed for feedings.  
__label__neu	It helps when you can't get baby to eat and you still want that bonding and contact!
__label__neu	What did our parents do besides clean up our messes?
__label__neu	I mean really. 
__label__neu	I spent so much time cleaning up my Zachy's Cheerios and snackies before I got this cup. 
__label__neu	Just the other week, my mom spilled all of his snackies on the floor when opening one of his snack containers! 
__label__neu	I went the next day, Monday and bought one of these Snack Trap cups. 
__label__pos	Granted, it costs a good bit more than those little cups at a local Dollar Tree, but hey, isn't it worth it not to have to clean up after your little one AND the grandparents? ;-) 
__label__pos	Anyway, spend the extra dollars and get one!!!
__label__pos	It is well worth the money. 
__label__neu	My little man got the hang of it after one showing.  
__label__pos	He loves to shake it and listen to the snackies inside, then he just reaches in that cute little hand and grabs a snack and just grins. 
__label__neu	He can take it all over the house and I don't have to go behind him with the vacuum. 
__label__neu	Now keep in mind, those Cheerios are small and sometimes they do come out, but only one to two at a time. 
__label__neu	Can't be 100% perfect, right? 
__label__pos	I highly recommend this cup for any mom or grandmom that is on the go or even just relaxing at home. 
__label__pos	5 stars!
__label__neu	Before I had my baby, I didn't think that I would need this item. 
__label__neu	However, I quickly realized after two days home that a drying rack was essential.  
__label__pos	I chose this one because it works all all types of bottles and I like the spinning feature.  
__label__pos	I also appreciate the two tiers and it doesn't take up too much room on the counter.  
__label__pos	I recommend this bottle rack to all new moms.
__label__neg	I cannot stand this highchair! 
__label__neg	It was way to difficult to clean. 
__label__neg	The tray sits up to high for baby! 
__label__neu	I went with another one after using this one for 6 months!
__label__neg	These pads are too small and too thick. 
__label__neu	They fall right out of your bra when you go to nurse your baby. 
__label__neg	They also look very unflattering under clothing. 
__label__neu	I like the Lansinoh pads much better as they are thin and large which means they can be folded over when you open the bra flap to nurse. 
__label__neg	Don't waste your money on Avent pads!
__label__pos	This toy is one of our five month old daughter's favorites!  
__label__neu	Our PeekaBoo Clutch Cube looks a bit different than this one...
__label__neu	it does not have a hook/clip to attach it to a stroller or car seat and the panda is on the inside with a black and white bullseye on the outside flap of one side.  
__label__neu	Overall, it the same toy with minor differences.  
__label__pos	The handles are ideal for small hands and our daughter loves to shake it and hear it jingle.  
__label__pos	She also enjoys chewing on the rings.  
__label__pos	"The ""peekaboo flap"" crinkles and this is another favorite aspect of the toy for her."
__label__pos	I also recommend the Infantino Peek, Rattle and Teether if your baby likes this toy.
__label__neu	Infantino Peek, Rattle and Teether
__label__neu	This was the first 'big' toy I bought for my son. 
__label__neu	We got it when he was 3mos old...
__label__neu	I had to put a dictionary under him so is feet would touch! 
__label__neu	Now, 6 months later, he's still a bouncing fool! 
__label__pos	My son has some crazy strong legs, and I absolutely credit this toy for helping him achieve that! 
__label__pos	It's great exercise for babies, and I love that the whole unit can be lifted as the child gets older.
__label__neu	As I sit here typing this review, my son is just behind me bouncing away!
__label__pos	An excellent purchase! 
__label__pos	I can't think of one thing I don't like about this toy!
__label__pos	(And that's with just NOW finding out that it folds for easy storage! 
__label__neu	I had no idea it did that till I saw this page!) 
__label__pos	I can't recommend this toy enough! 
__label__pos	You're little one will get SOOOO much use out of this! 
__label__pos	A GREAT purchase!!
__label__pos	this food organizer works great for jars. 
__label__neu	You can adjust the hight to fit different sizes of baby food jars. 
__label__pos	that is great. 
__label__neu	The only reason why I give it four stars and not five is that it doesn't accomodate the plastic containters (gerber food). 
__label__neu	We used both, containers and jars and therefore had to have two different stands.
__label__pos	Playtex sippy cups are BY FAR the BEST sippy cups!  
__label__neu	I have used others by Gerber and Avent- which both leaked!  
__label__pos	Playtex will never leave you scrubbing milk/juice stains out of your carpet- or your kids' clothes!
__label__pos	The insulated cup keeps fluids fresher longer, which makes this the HEALTHIEST cup delivering optimum nutrients and nutrition for your child!  
__label__pos	This feature is particularly nice if your child sips a little here and a little there- esp. MILK which spoils quickly.
__label__pos	I have bought this cup over and over again- not because it has worn out, but because I want several for our home, grandparents' home, diaper bag, etc.
__label__pos	VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT!
__label__pos	This isis breast pump set is great. 
__label__neg	The only thing I have a problem with is the little noise it makes whenever I pump and it feels not private.
__label__pos	Besides that, its very conviencent to use and easy. 
__label__neu	I think, since its plastic rubbing plastic it just makes the noise after awhile you pump.
__label__neu	This bag is large and fit my my son's car seat, clothes and stroller for travel.  
__label__pos	It's made of a sturdy material that won't rip when handled by the airport security and being thrown around after check-in.
__label__neu	I did not register for this but bought it after my son was born. 
__label__neu	I was sick of boiling water or waiting for a full load to run the dishwasher. 
__label__neu	I found that when I used the dishwasher bottles and nipples turned colors depending on the food that we ate that week. 
__label__neu	(red when we ate pasta). 
__label__pos	This is a great thing to have and we still use it a few times a week and my son is 10 wks old.
__label__pos	i got this for a co-worker who was having a baby boy - she used it a lot for swaddling his first few months and really liked it. 
__label__pos	After he out grew it she used it as a regular blanket, and still really liked it.
__label__pos	Avent bottles are one of the best out there.
__label__pos	Handy and easy to clean. 
__label__neu	They protect your baby from getting gas while he eats.
__label__neu	But if your baby is really gasy and has colic, I recomend you the Dr brown bottles. 
__label__neu	I suggest you buy or register for both (avent and dr brown)so if your baby does ok with gas and colic you use avent, and if not, you use dr brown (at least for a while). 
__label__neu	You will notice the difference in a few weeks. 
__label__pos	But I most tell you avent work very well with gasy babies, so if you dont want to invest too much  money in bottles, avent will do great.
__label__pos	There are other seat covers out there, but this one is superior. 
__label__neu	The tape keeps them from falling in the toilet and they are waterproof, for icky situations. 
__label__pos	Great for travel.
__label__neu	I even use them myself when we are in a restroom that doesn't supply the paper ones. 
__label__neu	Of course, we can't flush them. 
__label__neu	I just put them in the sanitary napkin disposal bins.
__label__neu	We got the superyard (or, as I call it, the &quot;Steel Cage Death Match&quot; yard) to contain our child in the living room and den while we are working. 
__label__neu	This is our experience. 
__label__neu	Your mileage may vary.
__label__pos	Plus side: The fence itself is robust and basically indestructable. 
__label__pos	In it's four or five sided form, it's very stable, even against toddler rage! 
__label__neu	(&quot;Attica, Attica!&quot;) 
__label__neu	The sides can be taken apart, to make smaller areas.
__label__neg	Minus side: the folding and locking mechanism is very stiff, and I was afraid I was breaking it at first when I was opening it up. 
__label__neu	So far it's not too much of a problem. 
__label__neg	The whole system is pretty heavy, and not nearly as portable as they try to tell you. 
__label__neu	Also, it's pretty clunky and large, so once it's up, we keep it up. 
__label__neg	The major downside is the price. 
__label__neg	Ack.
__label__pos	This is a great item for a working mom who has to pump on the go.
__label__neu	When my son was born last December this car seat was hard to find then so we borrowed one from my sister-in-law.  
__label__neu	She had a Graco car seat that was one year old, plus I have used other infant car seats for my two older children, a Graco and an Evenflo.  
__label__neu	When I got the Chicco I immediately noticed a difference in quality.  
__label__pos	The seat sets in the base easier, the handle to release the seat from the base uses less force, the straps have not once gotten folded over or creased, this is a big plus for me, I hate it when the straps get mangled, which happened with my other seats.  
__label__pos	One plus for me, though it is a small feature is the little storage compartment in the base, I throw a few diapers in there, just in case!  
__label__pos	I wish I had had this car seat 12 years ago for my oldest son!  
__label__pos	I highly recommend this seat, it can be used for longer than the conventional car seat, which is safer for baby.
__label__neu	My 11 month old is a very messy eater since she started feeding herself.  
__label__neu	After trying a variety of bibs and still getting stains on my daughter's clothes, I tried this bib.  
__label__pos	I love it!  
__label__pos	It has saved me from my laundry nightmare.  
__label__pos	It covers high up on the neck so food doesn't go down that way, it covers the length of the arm so I don't have to constantly be pushing her sleeves up, and it covers enough on her sides that even if she drops food next to her the bib is still protecting her clothes.  
__label__pos	I will never use another bib.
__label__neu	We have the changing table in our bedroom and the Diaper Dekor right beside it.  
__label__neu	For the first year there really wasn't any oder at all.  
__label__neu	"But as she got older and the ""stuff"" got stronger, we tend to get a wiff when you walk by now and then (That just tells us that it's time to change the bag, and most times it's pretty full before you start to notice the smell, so it pretty much needs changed anyway). "
__label__neu	As long as you change the bags when it's time for the weekly garbage pickup you should be fine.  
__label__pos	Getting a fresh bag is quick and easy to do.  
__label__pos	You can use this system with one hand. 
__label__pos	I do highly recommend this.  
__label__neg	The only downfall is that I haven't seen the refills at the local Walmart or Target and the nearest Babies R us is 45 minutes away so we order them online. 
__label__pos	But the bags last a long time.  
__label__neu	I had my baby in December 2005 and I am still using the original bags it came with as of February 2006.  
__label__pos	Despite the lack of availability of the refills I would buy this product again.  
__label__pos	Well worth the money.
__label__pos	This item works great for us!
__label__neu	Again my 15 month old has lost interest in even trying to mess with it.
__label__neg	The Boppy pillow sucks for breastfeeding!  
__label__neg	I was constantly fighting with this pillow.  
__label__neg	It's too soft, it's rounded, and it's too low.  
__label__neg	Too soft:  offers no support to keep baby's body in proper alignment.  
__label__neu	Rounded:  the baby rolls toward your belly and eventually slips inbetween you and the pillow, so then what's the point of having the pillow?  
__label__neg	"Too low:  unless your nipples are around your belly button,  you'll keep straining your back and neck to reach your baby--it's impossible to ""bring your baby to your breast"" instead of the other way around with this pillow.  "
__label__neu	You can try to put another pillow underneath the Boppy, but it will eventually slip off your lap.  
__label__neg	Then you can try to cross your leg under the Boppy, until it goes numb, yay.  
__label__neg	Breastfeeding isn't always easy, and the Boppy pillow makes it SUCH a hassle!  
__label__neu	"My lactation nurse has ""My Brest Friend"" pillows and they are SO much better!"
__label__neu	My Brest Friend Pillow, SunburstNice flat top, a firmer pillow, and a velcro belt to keep the pillow in place.  
__label__neg	Get My Brest Friend instead of Boppy!  
__label__neu	BTW, I saw pillow forms at Joann Fabric that are the exact same thing as a Boppy [...]
__label__neu	We go to a lot of outside events (car shows) where a bottle can't be warmed so easily.  
__label__neu	I bought this bottle warmer after reading the ratings and thought that I could prevent the metal disc from activating itself.  
__label__neu	The first time I used this warmer I was very careful how I placed it in my diaper bag and I was also very careful not to bump my diaper bag.  
__label__neu	When I went to use it, I was very surprised to see that it activated itself.  
__label__neu	I did give this bottle warmer a chance.........
__label__neg	I tried it about 6 times and it only worked one time.  
__label__neu	Needless to say, I returned it to Babies R Us.  
__label__neg	If you do decide to go against this rating, please keep your receipt.  
__label__neu	I think you would have to put this warmer in a steel case before placing it in your diaper bag in order for it not to activate itself!  
__label__neu	It would be a great invention if it wouldn't activate itself! 
__label__neg	I also wouldn't mind boiling the bag if the product would work.
__label__neu	I have read through some of the ridiculous low-star reviews and can't believe how anal people are.  
__label__neu	This is a baby's toy for $20.  
__label__neu	It's not a minature version of the New York Symphony stuffed into a $600 Bose music player, like some people are expecting.
__label__pos	Since this is a child's toy, I think it's serves it's purpose well.  
__label__pos	The music is clear.  
__label__neu	The lights flash when the music plays.  
__label__pos	I think it's neat that you can add or subtract musical instruments during the song that's playing so your baby can hear what each individual instrument sounds like.
__label__pos	My daughter loves the toy.  
__label__neu	It keeps her occupied for long periods of time and she's learning the names of each instrument and how they each sound both together in an orchestra and individually.
__label__neu	The people who are expecting this to be something more than it is need to understand that the toy wasn't designed for their enjoyment.  
__label__neu	The toy was designed for children.  
__label__pos	And, in my opinion, it's an exceptional toy that will keep most children entertained which, in and of itself, is a blessing.
__label__neu	This is the same product that sells for $40 more from other vendors on Amazon. 
__label__neu	I'm not sure why the price difference exists.
__label__pos	I ordered this mattress mainly because I love how light the foam mattresses are. 
__label__pos	I bought a different brand for my first child and it is light as a feather....
__label__pos	so easy to change the sheets and pull in and out of the crib, even overnight for those emergency changes.
__label__neu	We moved and I no longer had access to buy the same mattress for my second child. 
__label__neu	I ended up buying this one. 
__label__pos	It is heavier than the first mattress I bought, but still MUCH lighter than a traditional mattress. 
__label__pos	I like the square corners and the mattress pad and sheets I have fit well.
__label__neu	Even though the description said it takes an additional 2-3 days for processing, this was not the case. 
__label__neu	I think it arrived on my doorstop within just two days of placing the order.
__label__pos	My seven week old son has loved this swing since he was just a few days old.  
__label__pos	He loves to look at the mirror and the bird/bugs/leaves as they move around.  
__label__pos	The music and sound feature is great too.  
__label__pos	He absolutely loves being in the swing.  
__label__pos	It seems to really soothe him whenever he is fussy and he just really enjoys all of the movement and sound.  
__label__pos	It is worth every penny in my opinion compared to other swings that are on the market that don't have half the option that this one does. 
__label__neu	We use it each day and have only had to change the batteries once in the past 7 weeks.  
__label__pos	I highly recommend it.
__label__neu	I bought this for a 12 hour road trip with my 19 month old son.  
__label__neu	I think he may be too young for it, but it rests on his knees & seems to really bug him.
__label__pos	I really like the raised sides, it keeps his playthings and cheerios from sliding off of the tray.  
__label__pos	"This keeps us from having to twist around from the front & try to retrieve the ""lost"" items. :)"
__label__neu	It's very large, so plenty of room for his books.  
__label__pos	"He likes to ""read"" in the car, but his little hands often have trouble holding on to the books, so this solves that problem."
__label__pos	I also like the netted holders on the side for when he is older and has the dexterity to reach in and pull things out.
__label__neg	I don't like how it rests on his legs.  
__label__neg	It's vinyl and therefore is uncomfortable on his skin and is hot (we live in Florida).  
__label__pos	But it is very easy to wipe off.
__label__neu	We have a Britax Boulevard and the sides slope too steeply is the reason why it rests on his knees.
__label__neu	He'll use it for about 10 minutes, then he wants it off.  
__label__neg	Maybe when he's older, it won't bother him as much.
__label__pos	I love this monitor.  
__label__neu	I was hesitant to get it at first because the price was so reasonable but I went for it and have had no problems at all.  
__label__pos	The reception is so clear that I can hear my son breathing in his crib.  
__label__pos	I also love that it comes with two receivers.  
__label__neu	I keep one in my bedroom and one in another part of the house.  
__label__pos	I would definitely recommend buying this product...
__label__neu	don't waste your money buying something more expensive.
__label__neg	For us the Cons outweighed any pros...
__label__neg	Cons:1. Flow was insanely fast for my son from 2wks all the way to 6wks.  
__label__neu	He was drowning in milk.
__label__neg	2. Nipple TOO soft & too long...
__label__neu	so it made my son gag & spit up every few sucks, and his feedings that should've taken 10 min would literally take 30...
__label__neg	craziness.
__label__neu	3. Double nipple system means double washing (which we expected going into it).
__label__neu	4. Double nipple system ALSO means you have to release the milk that gets trapped in btwn the 2 every few sucks...
__label__neg	which we did NOT expect!
__label__neu	5. All this means the bottles require an all out demonstration & tutorial to a husband, grandmother, babysitter, helpful friend, etc...
__label__neg	unacceptable.  
__label__neu	Period.
__label__neg	6. Very Expensive, and in this case we didn't get a better product for the money.
__label__neu	Pros:  I hear it has worked well for some babies, so it can't be ALL bad, right!?
__label__neg	But it's definitely below average IMHO.  
__label__neg	If you do buy these I wish you more luck than we had!
__label__neu	I had one heck of a time assembling it.  
__label__neg	Instructions were very poor and the wheels are practically impossible to get all the way on.  
__label__pos	But my 5 1/2 month old seems to like it.
__label__neu	Thought these would be a great learning bowl for my daughter to use.  
__label__neu	She figured out how to un-suction the bowl in about 3 seconds flat.  
__label__neu	Totally defeats the purpose of the suction bottoms.  
__label__neu	The lids do hold the food in well for traveling, but quite bulky.  
__label__neu	You're better off using plain ole tupperware when toting around food.
__label__pos	Neither of my daughters liked to swing, but they both loved the bouncing motion.  
__label__neu	We did not have this exact jumperoo, but a slightly older version of the Fisher Price Jumperoo made to look like a pony.  
__label__neu	At around 5 months old, my youngest could bounce slowly in the jumperoo, and by 6-months-old, she was bouncing like crazy!
__label__neu	The footprint for the jumperoo is large, but if you have the space, it's a life saver - put on some lively music and it will entertain for a good 30 minutes!
__label__pos	I think it's also a great way to build leg strength.  
__label__neu	My youngest daughter bounced in the jumperoo every day from 5-months-old to 9-months-old.  
__label__neu	She is now 10 months and walking!
__label__neu	The stool can be adjusted to two heights. 
__label__neu	It also stores alot of toiletries. 
__label__pos	I would recommend this.
__label__pos	Although rather large & cumbersome in my apartment, my newborn daughter was perfectly comfortable and secure in it.  
__label__pos	My favorite feature was being able to use both hands to wash her or lather soap in my hands since the tub supported her so well. 
__label__pos	This is the ONLY tub I would recommend!
__label__neu	I'd like to start by saying that this is not a stroller for young babies. 
__label__neg	Young babies need more support than this model can give.
__label__pos	This is, however, a good and sometimes great stroller for toddlers and lighter weight preschoolers. 
__label__neu	It gives them enough support, and more importantly, enough constraint.
__label__neu	We bought one for our first child, and then another with our second. 
__label__pos	Much lighter than a double stroller, mom and dad found the ability to head off in different directions at the store a great feature.
__label__pos	The other feature I would like to point out is that it is lightweight to carry. 
__label__neu	Let's face it, after a certain age, kids don't want to 'sit' all day. 
__label__neu	They want to run and carry-on until they get so tired that they NEED to sit. 
__label__neu	We didn't mind toting this stroller about until it was time to use it.
__label__neu	Four stars. 
__label__pos	Very versatile. 
__label__pos	We've used our first one for four years and have just given both (the first and second) away to the Women's Shelter were they were very welcome.
__label__pos	I just love these. 
__label__pos	I now own 4 and it's not enough. 
__label__neu	I wish I only had these for bibs. 
__label__pos	They are so easy to put on and take off and clean. 
__label__neu	I throw them in the dishwasher or just rinse them off sometimes during the day. 
__label__neu	They catch EVERYTHING that drops---applesauce to bread crumbs. 
__label__neu	My kid even eats out of it when it drops down there. 
__label__neu	Saves the mess and saves the food.
__label__neu	We got this product a little late, my son was 2 months old... 
__label__pos	but it was still worth every penny. 
__label__neu	He was a fussy newborn and sometimes when he started to fuss in the swing we would just switch it from side-to-side to front-to-back (or vice versa) and that would do the trick. 
__label__pos	It was comfortable for him and he loved to snooze in it. 
__label__neu	Moreso than anywhere else.
__label__pos	 I loved that it could plug in so we didn't have to go through a ton of batteries to keep him moving. 
__label__pos	Also, the sound settings were great too. 
__label__neu	He never got into the lights until he got too big for it. 
__label__pos	We removed the net (very easy to remove!) when we realized that he could care less about the lights.
__label__neu	The seat tilted to one side, which was fine until he started getting too big. 
__label__neu	The product has a 25 lb weight limit, but at 20 lbs, my son was too big for the seat. 
__label__neg	It was difficult to buckle around him and several times he moved enough to hang his head over the side.
__label__pos	Other than that, it's a great swing. 
__label__neu	We have it tucked away for whenever we decide to give our son a sibling. 
__label__pos	It is especially perfect for those newborn babies.
__label__pos	The sling on this tub is so helpful when bathing a newborn...
__label__pos	perfect for nervous new parents!  
__label__neu	My daughter is 9 months old now and still uses this tub.  
__label__neu	Even though she has been able to sit by herself for quite some time now, it's reassuring to know that her back is well supported, and there is still enough room for her to play in the water.
__label__neu	I agree with the other moms that these are a little small, but if your newborn doesn't drink a whole four ounces at a time, it is great to be able to thaw only two ounces at a time. 
__label__pos	The good thing about these is that you can pump directly into them and freeze them. 
__label__neu	There is no need to transfer to a storage baggie thing and there is little or no chance that they will leak. 
__label__neu	When I was considering what to get, I kept reading about moms who pumped milk and then kept it in storage bags only to have it leak when thawed. 
__label__neu	Given the amount of time it takes to pump milk, to loose it to leaking bags is terrible. 
__label__neu	I only bought 12 of these and that was plenty - I am not a full-time working mom, so it was only to use sometimes when I was at school or working a few days in a row. 
__label__neu	If you work full time, you may want to buy two sets or even bigger ones. 
__label__neg	It is annoying to have to switch bottles several times while pumping.
__label__neu	I bought this diaper from Amazon on the recommendation of a friend and cloth-diapering guru- but I had no idea they were polyester! 
__label__neu	It says that nowhere on this Amazon page and I finally went to the Thirsties website. 
__label__neu	The entire lining and all the microfleece (the part that touches your baby's skin) is 100% polyester! 
__label__pos	If you are ok with that, then it's fine. 
__label__neg	However, I don't like the idea of synthetics to hold in all that moisture right next to my baby's skin. 
__label__neg	No thanks. 
__label__neu	I use cotton flat diapers normally with a wool or cloth cover and while they are messy, they don't normally leak. 
__label__neu	I was excited about trying this fitted diaper, but now that I know how they work, I will stick to REAL fabrics. 
__label__neu	I guess this diaper will make a nice gift for someone who doesn't mind polyester. 
__label__neu	They may work well in holding in liquid, but gee, that's what polyester DOES. 
__label__neg	I can't in good faith rate this well when it uses cotton only for the outside.
__label__neu	Baby has had less gas and fussiness since we have been using these bottles.  
__label__neu	Quick cleanup, quick fill up.  
__label__pos	Love the nipple variety too.
__label__pos	Because of the liners, it is easy to keep two of these bottles in use and not clutter up the kitchen with bottle pieces, etc.
__label__pos	Would highly recommend.
__label__pos	We absolutely can't say enough positive things about the Fisher Price Healthy Care Booster Seat.  
__label__pos	"Although I didn't even register for it at first, a friend said it was a ""must-have"", and boy, was she right!  "
__label__pos	This sturdy little booster is a workhorse, putting up with curious, sticky fingers meal-after-meal.  
__label__pos	My son fits in it comforably and I love the convenience of the 3 levels, tray cover and lightweight portability.  
__label__pos	I've taken this booster seat everyone - friends' houses, restaurants, vacations, and everywhere we go, we get compliments on it.  
__label__pos	It's a great item for grandma to pick up for those special visits to her house - forget the high chair!My son has used his booster exclusively since he was able to sit up comfortably.  
__label__pos	I highly recommend this wonderful booster!
__label__neg	These are cute and definitely a conversation piece, but they DO NOT WORK!  
__label__neu	A washcloth works better since it gets held on by his legs.  
__label__neu	This little pee pee teepee just fall right off when he moves!  
__label__neg	Now we're practicing Elimination Communication (readDiaper Free: The Gentle Wisdom of Natural Infant Hygiene) and make sure he pees before he's on the changing table, but these were a total waste of money.
__label__pos	This crib is very nice, and it's cheaper (plus free shipping) ordering it here on Amazon than at BabiesRUs. 
__label__neu	I expected the cherry finish to be a little darker, but it is darker than the photo. 
__label__neu	My husband put it together in about an hour, and didn't have any problems (I warned him beforehand that the instructions were a little lacking). 
__label__pos	The trundle drawer is somewhat silly (it would be better if it were connected to the crib), but may come in handy for storing extra blankets. 
__label__neu	Overall, the crib has met my expectations, so now I need to see how my baby boy takes to it when he gets here!
__label__neg	I thought it would be comforting to see my baby when she was rear facing, however as I soon found out if you are ever rear-ended this becomes a very dangerous projectile, that is aimed right at the babies head. 
__label__neg	I found that several babies are injured like this every year. 
__label__neg	It just isn't worth it!!!
__label__neu	I recently gave the red one to my 23 month old grandson.  
__label__neu	I wasn't real sure if he would use it.  
__label__neu	I have seen him use the top part as a bench to play his Fisher-Price piano.
__label__neu	He used the curved bottom part to prop himself while watching Thomas.  
__label__neu	The little mouth part has been used to throw at the dogs, which isn't great, but at least it is soft and light!
__label__neg	I just didn't care for this at all.  
__label__neg	The head part was not high enough for me - I am a two pillow sleeper.  
__label__neg	The curve drove me batty because this pillow did not eliminate the need to toss and turn, just made it harder.  
__label__neg	Couldn't figure out the belly support feature - just didn't help me.  
__label__neg	Doesn't come with a case which is $20 and all in all I think just knowing I am sleeping on a $40 pillow makes me uncomfortable!  
__label__neg	I returned it the next day - just not worth it.  
__label__neu	I'll stick with my pillow arsenal - it's not ideal but it's free and works just as well as this.
__label__neu	After trying multiple times to copy the amazing nurses at the hospital, I gave up on my swaddling attempts. 
__label__neu	My boy just squirmed until he freed a hand and then ruined all my attempts at a burrito wrap! 
__label__pos	My step mother gave us one of these and I love it! 
__label__pos	It's soft, easy and quick to use, and our son doesn't squirm out of it. 
__label__neu	He sleeps better...
__label__neu	meaning we ALL sleep better! 
__label__pos	I'll be buying more!
__label__pos	These are fantastic cups. 
__label__neu	My daughter can very easily get her hand into the cup and get cherrios out. 
__label__neu	A lot of cherrios do wind up falling out after a while but of course if it had no top they would all fall out in about 10 seconds. 
__label__pos	So far it has kept the food in the best, even if some does fall out.
__label__neu	Dont know what was the hype all about. 
__label__neu	Bought this for my son, he chews it like any other items I would offer to him otherwise nothing special about it. 
__label__neu	He's almost 5 months old
__label__neu	Maybe our baby was too small but it didn't seem like I was able to get this product tight enough on our newborn.  
__label__neu	The Carter's waffle blankets worked better for us and are a better value because they can be used for other purposes as well. 
__label__neu	After reading all the positive reviews I'm going to try this again so may update my review again now that he's bigger.
__label__neu	I was looking for a lightweight stroller for vacations and all day events. 
__label__neu	I own Britax Vigour which I really love but it takes a lot of space in a trank so I wanted something lighter and more compact in folding. 
__label__neu	I did a search and came across this stroller. After reading reviews I decided to give it a try. 
__label__pos	Oh Boy! 
__label__pos	This is the best umbrella stroller and the most comfortable from all others that I saw including Maclaren. 
__label__pos	Higher than all Maclarens, more stable than other umbrella strollers plus it reclines automaticly without belt udjustments. 
__label__pos	My toddler can easy fall asleep even faster than in Britax. 
__label__pos	Very comfortable and roomy.
__label__neu	It will last me for years. 
__label__pos	The color is beautiful and quality same as pricey strollers. 
__label__pos	The wheels are not plastic so the ride is really smooth. 
__label__pos	There is also a head pillow so it holds the head especially when child is asleep. 
__label__pos	The handles are soft and long enough even for tall people. 
__label__pos	This stroller has similar if not the same features as Maclaren Techno only it is $200 cheaper and way better than Maclaren. 
__label__neu	People stoping me and asking about this stroller. 
__label__pos	Love It! 
__label__pos	Love It! 
__label__pos	Love It!!!
__label__neu	Even before we had our baby I told my wife that I wanted this baby carrier as my first Father's Day gift. 
__label__pos	Now that baby is around, I love putting him in the carrier and taking him around, not just because I can free up both my hands, but mostly because we get to spend quality time very close together, and the movement when I walk seems to soothe him (unless he's hungry, of course!)
__label__pos	I would recommend all dads (and moms) to consider getting their Baby Bjorn. 
__label__pos	Along with the swing, the bouncer and a few other pieces of gear, it will not only make your first few parenting weeks easier to deal with but it will reward you time and again with unforgettable moments with your baby!
__label__neu	my son is 10 months old (has 1 1/2 teeth,  lol) and likes to eat fruit,  veges,  meat,  etc
__label__neu	he likes it when we put bits of food on his high chair tray so that he can pick them up and eat them himself
__label__neg	i thought this would be a great product for him but he never really took to it
__label__neg	he tried it once or twice and just gave it this weird look,  like what is this
__label__neg	even though he'll put almost anything else in his mouth)  he's used to eating real food so he's probably not willing to put up with the thick netting to get to the real food
__label__neg	by the way,  after buying this at this ridiculous price on amazon,  i saw the SAME EXACT 2 PACK at target for $1
__label__neu	39
__label__neu	I couldn't believe it
__label__pos	sometimes target just has random items for super cheap prices
__label__pos	since this product has such great reviews,  i did get a couple for some of my friends
__label__pos	it seems like a good product for little ones who are just starting out on solids
__label__neu	so maybe for 4-6 month olds
__label__pos	I love my Diaper Champ
__label__pos	My son is 3 months old and we have had a great experience with it
__label__pos	It's simple to use and is cost efficient
__label__pos	The biggest plus to this diaper pail is that you can use any plastic bag you want
__label__pos	As far as some people saying it smells,  I haven't had a problem
__label__neu	Once a week I soak it with Lysol and water to keep germs away
__label__pos	I highly recommed this product if you want a clean,  simple,  and convenient diaper pail
__label__neg	I first purchased the Safety's First Tot Locks and it was so complicated to assemble I returned it to Amazon
__label__neg	The drilling also made me really nervous
__label__pos	But these Kidco Lock Set is so easy
__label__neu	We have an entertainment center with 2 wooden doors that swing out
__label__neu	Our daughter has discovered that it's fun to open it and watch it slam shut,  except sometimes she forgets her fingers are there too
__label__pos	We got these Kidco Lock Set and it was so easy to stick on and now she's locked out for sure
__label__pos	We open the doors to access the PS3 games,  DVD player,  and remote controls on a daily basis and the magnet lock works wonderfully
__label__pos	No problems at all
__label__pos	We've had this for a few months now and am very pleased with this purchase
__label__pos	I get compliments all the time on this
__label__pos	It does the job well - holds bottles,  cups,  toys,  snack trap,  etc
__label__pos	The gripy surface on the inside of strap works great to keep cups/bottles from slipping out
__label__pos	The adjustable length is better than I expected it to be - didn't think I'd adjust it as often as I do
__label__neu	The hook-n-loop on the strap to connect to stroller/high chair/etc
__label__pos	is also nice - I attach a link on it for when it is just not right
__label__pos	It packs in my diaper bag compactly,  too
__label__pos	This is a good tub for transition between newborn to toddler
__label__pos	Plenty of room for my little guy to play around with his rubber ducky and splash a bit
__label__neu	I use it in the bottom of the bathtub
__label__neg	It would take up too much space using it in the kitchen sink
__label__neu	If your like me you have drying racks for dishes and baby bottles there and this just won't fit
__label__pos	But it sits great in the tub and doesn't slide around
__label__pos	my son got this toy for christmas and was too young for it,  but i brought it out when he was 6 mos old and he absolutely loved it
__label__pos	he plays with the balls and drops them in the basket,  and it's fun for the cat as well because he tries to get the balls out of the tray as well
__label__pos	fun for the whole family
__label__pos	and very durable
__label__pos	it's banged around a lot and has held up
__label__pos	def worth the money
__label__pos	This thing is great
__label__neu	We have a round crib rail,  so the normal guard would not have worked
__label__pos	I only wish that we'd found this one earlier
__label__neu	my son had plenty of time to leave a few marks on his expensive crib
__label__pos	We've had this on for over a year now,  and never had any problems with it
__label__pos	I recommend it
__label__neu	Used these with the Playtex drop-in system for my 3 week old when she started having trouble at the breast due to an ear infection
__label__pos	Couldn't believe how easily she could switch back and forth between the bottle and the breast,  she took the bottle first time it was offered with these,  no problems,  then went back to the breast a couple of feeds later with no confusion whatsoever
__label__pos	"Not only got us over a rough feeding patch but now means we don't have to face the horrors of weaning as it happened ""just like that"" with this bottle & nipple system"
__label__neu	Be very careful using this play pen
__label__neu	My baby loves playing without shoes or socks on
__label__neu	He was plaing in the play pen wiggling his legs against the walls of the play pen
__label__neg	Apparently the walls in the play pen are made from a very rough netting and scrubbed the skin off my babies toes
__label__neu	At first I couldn't understand why he had blood on his toes but then we noticed blood lines on the white netting
__label__neu	From now on he is only allowed to play inside when his shoes are on
__label__pos	These have stood up very well in our dishwasher and hold all of our baby's bottles and parts
__label__pos	A must have
__label__neg	NOT WORTH THE MONEY,  AND I ONLY GIVE IT TWO STARS,  BUT SINCE I EDITED MY REVIEW,  IT WON'T LET ME CHANGE THE NUMBER OF STARS I GAVE IT (I first reviewed it when I was using smaller glass bottles with not as many parts
__label__neg	Yes,  it's better for glass bottles than the collapsible ones,  but it's NOT at all good for BORN FREE (or any other wide neck bottles) bottles because you can only fit them on every other upright (they're too wide to go right next to each other),  and there's no room for all of the other venting pieces that come with Born Free bottles
__label__neg	The two bottom pieces are too small to hold much,  and things fall off of them
__label__pos	One of the best baby-proofing investments we've made
__label__pos	I feel so much better having this than I did before
__label__pos	Definately worth the small initial investment
__label__pos	I have owned my sippys for about a year now and just love them
__label__pos	We first used them to transition from the bottle which was plain easy with the soft spouts
__label__pos	The handles made it easy for my son to hold and the lids helped me not have a wet diaper bag
__label__pos	We have washed all parts in the dishwasher many,  many,  many times and not one piece has failed
__label__neg	Yes,  the top drips a little
__label__pos	But it was worth it for my piece of mind to switch to a non-BPA sippy
__label__neu	In truth,  in my 6 years of parenting,  I have found only 2 that have not leaked
__label__pos	I recommend these for piece of mind
__label__pos	I bought this swing used and it has done the job so far
__label__pos	It was the most quiet and space saving
__label__neg	My only complaint is getting my daughter in and out of it
__label__neu	The bar above can get in the way and you have to put the baby in a specific way to keep the head form bumping into it
__label__neu	The lights are also a bit annoying b/c they will only continue to play if the baby grabs the fishes hanging
__label__neu	If your child isn't grabbing,  or even if they are but not at the fish,  you have to do it for them if you want the lights
__label__pos	I do it,  b/c my daughter loves the lights
__label__neu	I guess you can't have it all
__label__pos	I hate the Diaper Genie so I was excited to try this Diaper Champ out and I have to say I love it
__label__pos	I hear so many people complaining about the smell and I have to say they're nuts
__label__neu	no offense)My son is now 5 1/2 months old and is nursing but also eats most solids including table foods when were out at a restaurant
__label__pos	His diapers have definately changed in odor but I have not noticed any odor coming from the Diaper Champ
__label__neu	Usually we change the bag about once a week,  every garbage day so no dirty diapers are sitting in there for longer than a week
__label__neu	I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor
__label__neu	I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom
__label__pos	So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me
__label__neu	They've got to be doing something wrong
__label__neu	Oh and the unit does need to be cleaned
__label__neu	if you get a big blow out diaper like babies are known to do,  and you get poop on the pail,  it does need to be wiped off
__label__neu	A good wiping out with some antibacterial wipe,  every week or two doesn't hurt either
__label__neu	Our son slept in the papasan for the first 2 months
__label__pos	He just really can relax in it
__label__pos	The incline is perfect
__label__neu	it lays back enough that he sleeps,  but not too much that I worry about spit up
__label__pos	I am so glad we bought this
__label__neu	Plus,  when I take a shower or fold laundry I just put him in the chair and take him into the bathroom or laundry room with me
__label__pos	He's quite content to just sit there
__label__pos	This monitor works great
__label__pos	We've been using this monitor for 3 months and have never had any problems
__label__pos	We do get static when it's placed by a cell phone but if it's moved or the cell is,  it's fine
__label__neu	We have a cordless phone and that doesn't interefer with it
__label__neu	I like the feature that it only goes on when your baby moves or makes a noise because you know exactly when your baby is moving
__label__pos	The charger is great too because you can use it plugged in,  or charge it so you can take it with you wherever you go
__label__neu	It lasts about a week with 5 hours of naps a day
__label__neu	She sleeps in a bassinet in our room so we don't use it at night
__label__pos	It is worth the money and from all the other reviews it seems to last a very long time
__label__pos	I love these wipes,  there's a short list of things I absolutely love using with my son and this is one of them,  along with FuzzyBunz diapers and Butt Paste
__label__pos	just a little warm water and these clean up the poopiest of butts in a jiffy
__label__pos	I love that I don't have to use any chemicals on my son's delicate skin and I can use a dry one to make sure his skin dries before putting a new diaper on him
__label__neu	They will stain if you don't care for them properly,  but washing them on the highest heat and little Shout gets the worst stains out every time
__label__neu	I bought this Floppy Seat when my son outgrew his Snugride carrier at 6-7 months
__label__pos	He is now 10 months and I can't imagine life without it
__label__pos	Reasons why I'm glad I bought it
__label__neu	1
__label__pos	Good sizeFits most shopping carts perfectly and provides complete coverage
__label__neu	Sure,  it's a little large for some of the smaller shopping carts or restaurant highchairs,  but the excess material doesn't really get in the way
__label__neu	In this case,  I think its better to have too much than too little
__label__neu	2
__label__pos	ProtectionThe Floppy Seat was especially useful when my son was smaller and had trouble sitting up straight in the seat
__label__pos	It gave him some extra cushion for comfort and protection while keeping him strapped snuggly into the cart
__label__neu	3
__label__pos	ConvenienceThis item is easy to wash,  easy to carry,  and easy to put onto shopping carts
__label__neu	Also,  it has a pocket on the inside of the seat that can be used for storage of a small bottle or toy
__label__neu	It's fairly compact if you take the time to roll it up into its built-in pouch
__label__neu	It's nice to be able to roll it up for taking into a restaurant for a highchair or if you're short on space in your car (I usually just throw it in my car without bothering to roll it up though
__label__pos	This is one of the things I can't live without
__label__pos	There are no bad smells until you open it
__label__pos	Using regular garbage bags is a huge money saver and there is plenty of room for tons of diapers
__label__neu	Plus it can also be used as a trash can
__label__neg	It was probably a great idea overall,  but I did not find any use for it
__label__neu	When you go out to eat - you have enough stuff to carry with you so the jares were just fine
__label__neu	At home I'd just use the food processor - easier and faster
__label__pos	The product is good,  if you need it
__label__neu	I started out using Playtex Premium Nursers with disposable liners,  but switched to AVENT because I heard that they are so great and my Playtex bottles wouldn't heat in the car
__label__pos	Since then,  my baby eats better,  sleeps better,  cries less
__label__pos	I didn't realize that the others were making him unhappy,  but he is a different baby since switching to these
__label__neg	The only issue I have is that it is hard for me to get the nipple into the collar without pulling the nipple through with my fingers and,  if you don't get the lid on just right,  it will leak
__label__pos	Other than that,  these are great
__label__neu	UPDATE
__label__neu	I guess I jumped the gun on this review
__label__neg	As we have used them more,  we have discovered that these bottles leak about 30% of the time
__label__neg	If you do not tighten the ring perfectly,  it will leak all over your hand and baby
__label__neg	I am over these bottles
__label__neg	Mine broke the first week I had it
__label__neg	One of the inner flap's spring broke
__label__neg	It does not contain odors very well
__label__neg	However,  I do like the foot pedal for opening and it does hold a lot of diapers
__label__neu	I feel like I would have been better off with a regular trash can with a lid though
__label__pos	I bought it for my 4 month old son and he loves it
__label__pos	I had doubts regarding the big size but it has turned out the best of this because I feel I have him free but secure at the same time
__label__pos	Colors and decoration are fun and keeps my baby busy and happy
__label__neg	"It's difficult to disassemble and reassemble this properly-- nothing ""clicks"" to let you know it's properly snapped into place,  and when it's not lined up exactly right,  it leaks"
__label__neg	My daughter loves to play with it,  but has so far absolutely refused to drink out of it,  defeating the purpose
__label__neg	"And the ""made in China"" part scares me in light of all the lead paint issues and toy recalls"
__label__neg	I wish I hadn't bought two of these at the same time-- I was so sure we'd like them
__label__pos	This lock is better than most of the locks on the market
__label__pos	It is much more sturdy than the flimsy stuff I'd found at the local 'R Us store
__label__neu	We purchased three locks and have had two of them installed so far for about two months
__label__neu	That being said,  you need to make sure the toilet lock snaps back into place after closing the toilet lid
__label__neu	It does not always do so on either of our toilets,  but we have the padded toilet seat and lids
__label__neu	Also know that most toilet seat and lids have a little white plastic cover that goes over the screws that attach the lid to the toilet
__label__neu	You will have to remove those
__label__neu	they won't work with the toilet lock
__label__neu	Also,  you need two hands to open the lock- one to push the button in and one to move the lock back
__label__neu	If you are going to the toilet to rinse a diaper that could be a bit awkward,  but a minor inconvenience in exchange with your child's safety,  I think
__label__pos	A good product that I would recommend to others with curious tots running around
__label__pos	This is my daughter's favorite thing to do
__label__pos	She loves it
__label__neu	At first,  she noticed the flashing smiling sun toy,  then she began to notice the hanging rattles,  the mirror,  and she even loves the bunny picture
__label__pos	This is the ultimate play gym,  and I highly recommend it
__label__pos	Plus,  it travels very easily - we've taken it out of town several times
__label__pos	It was a Godsend,  and takes up very little space
__label__neu	That counts for a lot when you are traveling with an infant
__label__pos	My daughter also loves the bright colors
__label__pos	Get it,  get it,  get it
__label__pos	I am a stay-at-home mom who breastfeeds but this product is still worth its weight in gold
__label__neu	I borrowed my sister's since I didn't need it for regular pumping,  but if I didn't have that one I would have to spend the money anyhow
__label__pos	I have lots of breastfeeding problems like clogged ducts,  regular engorgement,  and milk blisters and this has saved me hours of pain many times when the baby wouldn't nurse and a hand pump wouldn't do the trick
__label__pos	It's easy to use (I never even read the directions) and is great for building up a supply
__label__neu	I bought another tub initially - a friend told me about this one
__label__neu	I will stick with this until my daughter outgrows it
__label__pos	A must have
__label__pos	A little pricey for having to replace every three months,  but if this is all I have to replace it is well worth it
__label__neu	We use this toy all the time when we need to distract my son (ie in a doctor's office,  restaurant,  long car rides,  etc)
__label__pos	It is pleasant sounding and the button is easy to press and the handle makes it easy for my one year old to grip
__label__pos	I liked it so much I just purchased one for my friend's baby
__label__neu	I took the booster seat out of the box & put the strap over my should & the strap broke loose from the base
__label__neu	Looks like the thread used to seal the strap into the base broke free
__label__neu	I had to redo the strap & secure it
__label__neg	Poor quality to have it break 5 mins out of the box
__label__pos	AMAZING
__label__pos	my son is almost 7 months and we're still using it (although with supervision)this is NOT like a regular nursing boppy,  it's a big pillow that nestles your babywhy i love it
__label__pos	great for preemies
__label__pos	my son was 5lb7oz and it was perfect
__label__pos	"I think he loved it because it was cozy and kept him in a ""tight"" environmentit's elevated slightly so your baby isn't lying on their back and just staring at the ceilinggreat for transferring a sleeping baby"
__label__neu	my son would fall asleep in it,  then we'd move the boppy to his bed,  and pancake scoop him out onto bed,  easy transition
__label__neu	helpful for tummy time - forces him to work on his neck muscles since the center is dipped in but the pillow supported his check and pelvic areaeh
__label__pos	the lounger,  when dirty does need to be cleaned,  the down time it takes to clean it is tough since we came to rely on it so heavilythe covers are expensivei'd recommend this product to anyone
__label__pos	it gets great useage,  and gives baby visibility to their surroundings
__label__pos	my son had a blast seeing his feet for the first time
__label__neu	when your baby outgrows it,  make it into a dog bed
__label__neu	my dogs try to sneak onto it when the baby isn't in it
__label__pos	We have been so thankful for the heart-2-heart insert as our son has loved his time spent in it
__label__pos	He's only 4 days old and the insert is just perfect for his little body
__label__pos	It's supportive and comfortable for him
__label__pos	He sleeps like a champ whenever he's in it
__label__pos	We are grateful that Ergo came out with this new insert as we were hearing that their previous insert was not really working with newborns
__label__neu	The Diaper Genie II and it's brother the Diaper Genie II Elite are barely related
__label__neu	We bought a Diaper Genie II to supplement our Diaper GEnie II Elite
__label__neu	It appeared as if the only difference was size - slightly smaller - and the lack of a foot pedal
__label__neu	What we didn't realize was that the foot pedal was how the ingenious airlock system works on the Elite
__label__neu	On the regular Diaper Genie II,  you have to push the diaper through the hole
__label__neu	first,  it takes quite a bit of pressure
__label__neu	Secondly,  you have to push it WITH the diaper - and you can imagine that you might get your hands dirty doing that
__label__neg	So,  we were disappointed as soon as we set it up and saw how it works - but it was too late to return the product
__label__neu	So now we're stuck with it
__label__neu	Updated
__label__neu	We have been using it for a month and have gotten used to it
__label__neu	I'd still recommend the Elite II,  but this product isn't bad for a 2nd diaper disposal unit
__label__neu	You do get used to the amount of pressure required to push down a diaper and as new parents,  we've learned how to roll up the diaper into a tiny,  compact package
__label__neu	It's been about a month and I haven't gotten my hands dirty yet
__label__pos	This sheet is so soft
__label__pos	It feels wonderful,  and I was pleasantly surprised
__label__pos	I love the color,  too
__label__neu	I read in the reviews that it may shrink in the dryer,  and so I have been careful - hang drying it when possible and drying it on delicate when not
__label__neu	Thus far,  I have not noticed any shrinking
__label__pos	Very pleased
__label__neu	ADDITIONAL INFO
__label__neu	I wrote this review in June,  2009
__label__neu	It is now January,  2011
__label__neu	This sheet is still soft,  still fits the mattress (I've been drying it on my regular settings in my dryer for the last year,  at least,  without any shrinkage)
__label__neu	All the other brands of sheets I bought no longer fit,  or are no longer soft,  but these have endured
__label__pos	I'll be buying more of these sheets for my daughter's crib,  because I am so impressed
__label__neu	I used this tub with my 1st son almost 4 years ago and now I bought a new one for my 2nd son born this year
__label__pos	Living in an apartment,  this tub is great for small spaces
__label__neu	I use it in the big tub and when I am done,  I just rinse it and leave it to dry
__label__neu	When dried,  I fold it and put it in the cabinet
__label__neu	The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I had to buy a sponge to use on top of this in order to keep my son from slipping
__label__neu	But considering it folds for storage,  that was not a big issue
__label__pos	It's a great tub otherwise
__label__neu	The first time I gave this to my daughter there was no hesitation at all
__label__neu	right into her mouth and she went to town on it
__label__pos	She loves it and it's easy for her to manipulate
__label__neu	Plan on buying some for all the new mom's I know
__label__pos	THIS ITEM IS GREAT
__label__neu	I DON'T HAVE TO STRUGGLE TO GET THE SNOWSUIT ON MY NEWBORN
__label__neu	I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWER ABOUT THIS BEING SAFER THAN A SNOWSUIT BECAUSE U CAN ADJUST THE CARSEAT STRAPS RIGHT TO YOUR BABY WITH NO LOOSE STRAPS LIKE THERE WOULD BE WITH A JACKET OR SNOWSUIT
__label__neu	IT IS SO SOFT AND WARM
__label__pos	THE BUNDLE ME IS BEST
__label__neu	AND THE PINK IS SOOOO CUTE FOR MY BABY GIRL
__label__neu	Pros
__label__neu	Nice night light3 color options (altho 1 doens't work)Has a timer so you don't have to worry about shutting off laterLooks cuteCons
__label__neu	"The red light,  does not reflect very well and you can't really see it at all on a ceiling or wallsThe constellation of ""stars"" are not really stars,  they are triangles"
__label__neu	I started using this the day my milk came in and have used it every day since
__label__neg	"One minor complaint--the breastshields were not one-piece items (sold individually,  they are one-piece),  which makes it somewhat more difficult to clean,  as you need to break the pieces down,  and it's harder to see how your milk flow is going,  since the ""seam"" blocks your view a bit (plus,  the breastshields are more translucent than clear)"
__label__pos	These pads are two of the best items I have purchased so far for my baby
__label__neu	I use one or both of them every day to keep the baby on for air time out of her diaper as well as when I have the baby with me on the bed or couch--even when the baby is diapered--just in case
__label__neu	I am definitely getting more of these as well as the smaller version
__label__neu	I just wish they were available in a third size in between the smaller and the larger versions
__label__pos	perfect
__label__neu	adds extra padding,  protects the seat and is easy to wash
__label__neu	we have one on our single and two on the double
__label__pos	"a ""must have"" for the BOB stroller"
__label__neu	"Warmers stated ""will not yellow the wipes"""
__label__neg	BULL
__label__neg	Not only do they turn yellow they dry out
__label__neu	I had my warmer plugged it for 1 month and through it out
__label__neu	Every mom thinks they NEED warm wipes
__label__neu	Use a conventional warm wash cloth
__label__neu	It's better for baby anyways
__label__neg	To much chemicals
__label__neu	Save your money ladies
__label__pos	I give this a 4 star,  it's genius,  but it's expensive (it's really just a t-bar strap that you could probably use your own belts,  so for the price it gets 4 instead of 5 star)
__label__pos	It worked great for us to wheel around our toddler in the airport,  easy to take apart during the security search,  and great to carry around in your purse/diaper bag until landing where you'll have to do it all over again until you get to the car
__label__neu	Could not have managed to have her Britax Marathon carseat (lugging it around) w/o this unique tool
__label__neu	I loved the Travelling Toddler
__label__neu	It was easy to undo and attach,  it was super quick through the security lines & I have no complaints except for the cost of the thing
__label__neu	Much cheaper than other products,  but for around $18 all you're really getting is a 't'-strap that connects to the seat and around your carry-on luggage,  which probably cost 50cents to make
__label__pos	Then again,  it was SOOOO WORTH IT,  when we travelled
__label__neu	If you know a friend who has one,  save yourself some cash & borrow it
__label__neu	Ok,  I'll be honest - we never even got these installed
__label__neu	My dad,  who is VERY mechanically inclined and my husband spent half an hour trying to figure out how to even unroll it
__label__neu	Then,  they spent another hour trying to figure out how they were going to rig it up so it would work with our stairs
__label__neu	We have the carpet covered baseboards and then a chair-rail like trim
__label__neg	Even with the extra installation kit,  it was going to be a HUGE challenge
__label__neg	But,  the deciding factor in my sending these back was how hard they were to open
__label__neu	I have elderly in-laws and several different babysitters who were ALL going to need to use these to go up and down the stairs several times a visit
__label__neu	It was just too hard for me to try to remember the 3 steps it took to open them,  let alone asking all those other people to do it
__label__neu	I sent them back and ordered an accordian style gate instead
__label__neu	We'll see how it goes
__label__pos	This sling is the best purchase I made
__label__neu	They come in a range of colors,  I am sure everyone can find at least one color they like
__label__neu	As far as I can tell it is like a moby although I have never owned one
__label__neu	Once you know how to wrap it using it has never been easier
__label__neu	It frees up your arms and allows you to carry out chores without anything holding you back
__label__neu	Also you are able to nurse hands free and discreetly
__label__neu	I also like that the sling has no pressure points so you can keep your baby in it for as long as you want to
__label__neu	My Little one will stay in the sling for hours when out although he can get tired and fussy in the stroller
__label__neu	The way the wrap goes round means that the weight of your little one is spread across you back in hips
__label__neu	In many ways I feel as though I am pregnant again
__label__pos	I truly cannot say enough great things about this sling
__label__neu	A great price and you will be the envy of all
__label__neu	I have had friends buy one because they have seen me use mine
__label__pos	I would recommend to all
__label__neu	We bought this for our three month old
__label__neu	The first time we put her in it she just sat there for a minute or two before wanting out
__label__neu	However,  it wasn't too long afterward that she started jumping around in it and staring at all the toys
__label__pos	Now she is four months old and loves to spend time in it and grab at the toys
__label__neu	It was very easy to put together and the seat cover is easily removable when it needs to be washed
__label__pos	There are a number of colorful toys on it that my daughter really enjoys,  including the music and sounds
__label__neg	My only complaint is that on even the lowest setting my daughter can't reach the floor with her feet right now
__label__neu	We fixed that by putting a sturdy,  four-legged stool underneath her feet
__label__pos	It is really a nice product to have
__label__neu	Our baby was almost exclusively breast fed from the start
__label__neu	We were not very diligent on giving her a bottle often so she probably got pretty attached to the breast
__label__neu	She is now 12 weeks old and since I am going back to work this week,  we started being more diligent 2 weeks ago with the bottle
__label__neu	She took it without much problem and I'm confident it won't be an issue when I go back to work
__label__neu	The venting also seems to work as she doesn't swallow a lot of air - doesn't burp or get gas a lot
__label__pos	I also like how the bottle comes apart so that you can clean it well
__label__neu	My 2 year old daughter is still not able to keep blankets on herself while she sleeps
__label__neu	She would wake up when she got cold
__label__neu	This keeps her warm all night
__label__neu	It is a little difficult for her to put her feet through the footholes by herself after they are tucked in
__label__neu	Sometimes we will put socks on her and keep her feet out
__label__neu	If she pulls them in,  she can still walk in it down the hall to our room
__label__neu	It would not be easy for her to get off to use the restroom on her own anyway
__label__pos	But we do really like it as a wearable blanket
__label__pos	She also likes to wear it around the house when it is cold,  cuddled up on the couch
__label__pos	This is a great product
__label__neu	I leave it on the counter and throw in pacifiers,  WASHED bottles,  etc all day then throw in the microwave when full
__label__neu	Uses much less water and energy than running the dishwasher
__label__neu	"The SwaddleMe (which was the only way to swaddle our little Houdini) and the white noise CD ""For Crying Out Loud"
__label__neu	particularly the vacuum cleaner track) were like an off-switch for our newborn
__label__neu	I'd give up disposable diapers and the swing before I'd part with these
__label__neu	Bought this for our daughter when she was four months old and in the 25th percentile for height and weight
__label__neu	We wanted something her feet touched the floor in and some reviewers said their smaller babies did touch
__label__neu	My daughter was able to touch the floor right away
__label__neu	At nine months she still plays in it
__label__neg	However,  the toys are not easy to get on and a few fall off often but can be put back on
__label__neu	We usually give her other/additional toys to play with and there is open tray space to set those on
__label__neu	We use this in our bathroom and laundry room to keep her stationary while we do whatever we have to get done
__label__neu	Others complain this isn't very bouncy -- and they're right -- but this isn't a bouncer
__label__neu	It's meant to be a safe place you can put baby where s/he can play with toys and bounce a bit and keep them occupied while mom and dad do what they have to do
__label__pos	Bottom line is that it doesn't look much different than the others like it at the store which are upwards of $80-100 and this does the job just as well
__label__pos	My daughter is happy enough with this saucer
__label__pos	I'm really glad I didn't waste my money on one of the more expensive ones
__label__pos	These are the only sheets I have ever used in my son's crib
__label__neu	I bought one regular sheet to cover the mattress,  and I've never taken it off
__label__neu	I just use my Ultimate Crib Sheets
__label__neu	I have three
__label__neu	I would recommend that number
__label__neu	I can't imagine how much of a pain it would be to have to lift the crib mattress up to change sheets
__label__pos	this is just SO EASY snap,  snap,  snap and you're done
__label__neu	I never dry mine in the dryer
__label__neu	I hang it on a drying rack and it's usually dry after a few hours
__label__neu	I want mine to last,  and using the dryer tends to wear them out
__label__neu	I've never not had one on hand,  with 3 total
__label__neg	I used the diaper genie with my first son and was not impressed
__label__neu	This is total different
__label__neu	There are no weird bags and twisting - and it was smelly
__label__neu	With the diaper champ you use a normal kitchen trash bag - I buy the vanilla scented ones
__label__pos	We have been using it for a little over 8 months now and it has started to smell a little (that's why not 5 stars),  I did clean it up with bleach and let it sit outside to air out and now it is much improved
__label__neu	I don't think you can totally avoid all smells,  especially after they start eatting real foods and having more solid poops
__label__pos	It is the best one I have found
__label__pos	I think my son will kill me later in life for writing this BUT the handles really helped him with going #2
__label__neu	Sometimes he felt the need to shake or grp on them
__label__neu	Whenever he sits he used this potty topped,  he has Two
__label__neu	one with and wiltout handles
__label__neu	hey two is fine
__label__neu	as long as he goes in the potty
__label__neu	I'd have more lined up if he wanted
__label__neg	lol)I am not a fan of any shield
__label__neu	Unless you lift and place your son on it
__label__neu	He may scratch himself down there
__label__neg	My son hurt himself and complained for over 5 hours
__label__neu	so we took it off
__label__pos	Highly reccommend,  no need to make the first potty trips a bowl full of trama
__label__neu	Having a familar character always helps as well
__label__neg	this thing is the worst piece of junk i've ever ordered
__label__neu	I've put up 4 metal gates throughout the house so far,  and needed 2 more,  so I figured I would buy this since it's so much cheaper than the metal gates
__label__neg	turns out,  this thing is a piece of junk
__label__neg	I spent over an hour,  trying to get it to stay up,  but each time I let go the darn thing would fall right off
__label__neu	It simply doesn't extend tightly against the walls like it supposed to
__label__neg	instructions were vague
__label__neg	I packed it back up and will be returning it for sure
__label__neu	This hands-free gate works when you step down on the foot paddle which causes a latch to open
__label__neu	You can then push the gate open with a hand or a knee
__label__pos	The gate is fairly easy to install (a necessary slim wrench is included in the box) and requires no screws or glue
__label__pos	The gate provides good protection
__label__neu	The bars on the gate are well-spaced so even small infants shouldn't be able to crawl through
__label__pos	When properly installed,  it provides solid protection,  although (important
__label__neu	you should regularly check it to make sure it's securely affixed to the door frame
__label__neu	Also,  over time the gate tends to bend a little,  so you should use the little wrench-like tool to adjust it when necessary
__label__neu	In short,  a very good gate for keeping kids out of a certain room
__label__neg	But this is *NOT* designed and should never be used to guard the top of a stairway
__label__nan	I love the Vent-air bottles - tthat has been all we have been using for months now
__label__pos	I bought 1 of these becasue my son used to use Avents
__label__neg	he hated the nipple on the bottle
__label__pos	The bottle itself is fine
__label__pos	I love how it comes apart becasue it makes it so easy to clean
__label__neg	It is kind of hard to hold becasue it is so wide though
__label__neu	I can't take off too many stars for my son's personal preference but just because a baby likes one natural nipple doesn't mean he will like another
__label__neu	After trying four different types of pacifiers,  my exclusively breastfed baby would only use this pacifier
__label__pos	I like how the pacifier does not have hard parts,  minimizing the ring around the mouth,  and the nipple is round rather than odd shaped
__label__pos	As this type of pacifier is difficult to impossible to find in major retail stores or local drug stores,  I ordered it from Amazon and had prompt service with great communication
__label__pos	This is a wonderful product
__label__pos	I actually purchased it used from an infant resale shop and I am so happy that I did
__label__neu	Initially the diapers seemed a little small in the large container but I soon discovered that newborn diapers could be stacked in two stacks which means the container holds twice as many
__label__pos	Now my son is about to turn one and his size four diapers are a perfect fit,  we still use this item every day
__label__neu	At our Newborn Essentials class before our child was born,  I asked the instructor if she had heard of the Woombie
__label__neu	She said that she had heard very mixed reviews on it
__label__neu	Nevertheless,  I was excited to try it out since my baby broke out of every swaddle
__label__neg	He hated it
__label__neu	He was only a few days old but it didn't seem long enough
__label__neg	It sorta looked like his head was attached to a bag of angry kittens
__label__neu	I would say try to buy at a store so you can take it for a test-run and see if your baby will tolerate it
__label__pos	I'm pleased with this monitor
__label__neu	I've had it for about 3 months and I haven't had any problems so far
__label__neu	Originally I had registered for a different monitor,  but I had to make a change when I looked into the frequency of my wireless internet
__label__neu	For those of you with wireless internet,  apparently the 2
__label__neu	4 Ghz monitors can cause interference
__label__neu	On the other hand though,  I have had some interference with this monitor picking up some phone conversations in the neighborhood
__label__neu	It doesn't happen very often,  but when it does,  I just change to the other channel and the problem goes away
__label__neu	The nice thing about the child unit is that it attaches to the crib-you just lock it onto the top bar and then unlock it when you need to take it off to recharge
__label__neu	I find that I have no problem with the unit lasting through night (10-12 hours),  but that I do need to recharge it during the day
__label__neu	The parent unit can easily clip onto your pants,  or you can put it in your back or shirt pocket
__label__neu	Kind of a nice feature when you're running around the house and you don't have time to put it down
__label__neu	The lights are nice too,  although I like to have the volume on anyways so that I can monitor him better
__label__pos	Nonetheless,  it's a nice feature
__label__pos	Nice features,  works well,  and goes for a reasonable price
__label__pos	I think this monitor is a pretty good bet
__label__neg	We just got this mattress and I'm worried about using it for the baby because it does NOT seem as firm as crib mattresses are supposed to be
__label__neg	It has 150 coils which is supposed to be sufficient but I wish I had looked for more than 200 coils
__label__neg	"Also,  the fact this mattress' inner materials are ""organic"" is pointless because it's entirely wrapped in some kind of plastic"
__label__neg	And the label doesn't tell you what kind of plastic,  at a time when parents want to know what kind of plastic is in their baby's products
__label__neg	If you want a truly organic mattress spring for the expensive Naturepedic one
__label__neg	I was trying to save money when I bought this one thinking I'd found an affordable alternative but I only got what I paid for
__label__neg	Avent bottles are not as great as all the write ups
__label__neg	They allow to much air to enter the baby's system
__label__neg	Spend your money on a better bottle like Dr
__label__neu	Brown's or Platex
__label__neg	I know several new mother's who bought in the ad hype about these bottles and ended up trashing them and buying something else
__label__neg	"do not buy this potty chair simply for the ""bells and whistles""  they never seem to work at the right time - or at all half of the time"
__label__neg	I would have liked to see it be a little deeper as far as size goes,  my boys had a little trouble squeezing in when the protector was on
__label__neg	The main thing that annoys me and maybe this only happens with boys,  but it occasionally leaks underneath between the bowl and where it slides in
__label__neu	I am guessing that since the boys urine comes out the front,  rather than underneath,  it leaks out in that space where the bowl slides out
__label__neg	There are even times that my older son's pants got wet from resting at the front of the potty when he sat
__label__neg	If I had to do it all again,  I would opt for using the big potty from the start - cleaning those things out gets old fast too
__label__neu	The thing about this strap is that it uses the latch system on the car seat
__label__neu	So you have to adjust for the suitcase
__label__neu	Then adjust for the car
__label__neg	Then adjust for the suitcase again
__label__neu	I am travelling alone with my son
__label__neg	There is no way one person can work this
__label__neg	So unless your going to be traveling with someone I do not recommend it at all
__label__neg	I spent SO much money on these bottles while I was pregnant,  because they were supposively the best bottles to use while breastfeeding
__label__neu	The bottles are expensive so I thought they must be good bottles
__label__neg	WRONG
__label__neu	Expensive does not always equal good
__label__neg	I tried using these bottles when my baby was two weeks old,  and the feeding session ended in complete frustration on mine AND my baby's part
__label__neg	The nipple shape is horrible
__label__neg	Even the newborn nipples are WAAAAAY too long for a newborn's mouth ( and my baby has a BIG mouth
__label__neu	He was 9 lbs at birth
__label__neg	Not to mention that these bottles let him suck SOOOO much air and caused him to spit up several times
__label__neu	I thought maybe my baby was just having problems with taking a bottle,  so I went and bought the Playtex VentAire
__label__neu	Those bottles are a LOT cheaper and SOOOOOOOOOOOO much better
__label__neu	He took the bottle immediately and didn't get NEARLY the amount of air
__label__neg	Don't waste your money on these bottles
__label__neg	"They are NOT the ""best"" bottles to use while breastfeeding"
__label__neg	SO if you are pregnant,  don't make the same mistake that I did and buy a whole load of these bottles thinking that they are the best
__label__neu	Do yourself a favor and stick with Gerber spoons or another brand
__label__neg	These are NOT dishwasher safe
__label__neu	I have used them for only a couple months (have a ten month-old who didn't start solids until 5 months
__label__neg	After just a month or so of use,  the spoon color started to fade and bleed and change to a brownish yellow stain on each one
__label__neg	They are awful
__label__neg	I won't use them anymore because I'm worried about what could be getting into my baby's food
__label__neg	I highly recommend you avoid this item
__label__neg	I really don't see the big deal about this toy,  and neither does my 10 month old
__label__neg	He's not the least bit interested in it,  and I've shown him that the legs make sounds
__label__neg	He doesn't care
__label__neg	I think it was a waste of money
__label__neu	Oh well
__label__neg	Forget it
__label__neg	The first time my 16 month used the cup she stuck her entire hand in it and pulled up really fast and all of her snack went flying
__label__neu	Note - I maybe filled it a 1/4 of the way
__label__neu	I tried again thinking she'll realize what she did,  which she did,  but now she just pushes the top in until everything falls out
__label__neg	Great concept,  but just too big to work
__label__neu	Maybe for older kids it may work
__label__neg	I am so unhappy and fustrated with these monitors
__label__neg	The battery only lasts about 5 hours off the charging base so I can't make it through the whole night without it beeping due to low battery
__label__neg	And it doesn't just beep once - it beeps and beeps and beeps until you do something about it
__label__neg	I have to keep it on the charger all night so it doesn't go out
__label__neg	There is tons of static and extra noise
__label__neg	Also,  the belt clip is not tight - the monitor always falls off of my belt if I bend down to much
__label__neg	Just super dissapointed with these monitors - ABSOLUTELY NOT worth its big price tag
__label__neg	Please look elsewhere - DO NOT recommend
__label__neg	This is the worst music/soothiing toy we have purchased
__label__neg	We have many as our daughter loves music and ocean sounds,  but this one is horrible,  i would not recommend this to anyone
__label__pos	It make for a cute stuffed animal and thats about it
__label__neu	My baby ended up being her own baby care timer
__label__neg	I thought I was all prepared before she was born by having this thing to help out,  but it was more of a pain to try to use
__label__neu	I was too busy trying to get on with just taking care of her to even use it for more than a week
__label__neg	And the settings kept resetting themselves anyway,  which is SO FRUSTRATING on 2 hours sleep
__label__neg	It was easier for us to just use pen and paper to write times down,  no buttons to fiddle with,  no wrong times
__label__neu	Now I know this is primarily my fault
__label__neg	but it's still annoyiong
__label__neg	This will not stick to my tile because it is painted
__label__pos	It's adorable,  I just can't use it
__label__neu	I should have researched a bit more
__label__neu	I worked in the church nursery for over 4 years with this toy in one of the toyboxes available to the children
__label__neg	I never saw any of them properly engage with it
__label__neg	They'd pull it out,  bang it a couple of times (starting up 2 different sounds) and then get bored and crawl away
__label__neg	It was the one toy I knew I'd never buy for my children
__label__neg	Good concept,  but very messy
__label__neg	not only when the baby is sucking on it,  but afterwards,  trying to clean it is a nightmare
__label__neg	I tried it with fresh banana today for the first time,  and spent over half an hour trying to scrub out the fiber
__label__neg	Not very practical
__label__neu	Bought a hundred dollar pack and play and this was my ONLY option for a sheet
__label__neu	Can't they make the cheap one and a higher end sheet for those who don't mind spending money for better quality
__label__neu	Also,  keep in mind your wash loads
__label__neu	I bought this in navy and then realized that everything else I have for baby is pastels
__label__neu	Sheet has to be washed seperately from rest of baby's laundry
__label__neu	Would be better to choose a lighter color that could go into the same load as the rest of the baby's laundry
__label__neu	I cannot comment on how useful this item is for swaddling a baby as we are not due for a few months
__label__pos	However,  I just wanted to comment that the colour of the blanket is much nicer than the online picture
__label__neu	We have purchased the green with beige trim
__label__pos	The picture doesn't do it justice
__label__pos	It is more mint colored and the beige trim highlights it rather than making it look a little like a bandage (as I think the picture online does
__label__neu	The original manufacturer also has a website and there is a video of how to use this swaddle on there
__label__pos	That was useful to me as a soon-to-be first time Mom
__label__neu	REVIEW
__label__neu	Baby arrived
__label__neg	He HATES LOATHES DESPISES this
__label__neg	He can kick his legs out of it in sec
__label__neu	I bought 2 as I figured he'd be likely to soil it in the night and since everyone said it was such a miracle I didn't want to be without
__label__neu	I'd recommend you buy just one of these and try it out
__label__neu	I bought this wanting to see my son in a rear-facing carseat
__label__neg	First,  I couldn't properly secure it with either the latch or velcro
__label__neu	Since we have a jeep grand cherokee and he was in the middle of the backseat there was no place to attach it
__label__neg	I finally managed to rig something up though but after just a short time the mirror surface was fogging and unclear
__label__neg	I certainly couldn't see him in the tiny rearview mirror attachment
__label__neg	My baby will NOT stay wrapped up in this
__label__neg	Even when she was just a few days old,  she was strong enough to wiggle out
__label__neg	And while velcro seems like a good idea,  once she gets it loose,  it could scratch her
__label__pos	The Magic Blanket is a much better product,  and I can even do a better job swaddling traditionally,  with a large,  lightweight blanket
__label__neg	It is a little too thin for my taste,  but most covers seem to be
__label__neg	It easily gets snagged on rings and jewelry so now I have to take my jewelry off before changing him
__label__neg	It is pretty thin so it doesn't absorb or protect against any wetness
__label__neu	I use a small pad to help protect it
__label__pos	It is basically for design now and to match my son's bedding
__label__neu	I bought a MOBY wrap first
__label__neg	After a few days I was tired of wrestling with 15 feet of fabric and then it was hot
__label__pos	This BB is so handy
__label__pos	It will fit in the diaper bag and it is easy to put on like a purse and the baby fits right in
__label__pos	It is also easy to get the baby to sleep and then remove and put in bed or swing
__label__pos	This is much easier than lugging a car carrier everywhere (they're so heavy
__label__neu	This way you can leave the car seat in the car and just pop the baby in this sling to get groceries or go to the Dr
__label__neu	etc
__label__pos	And if you don't like people to touch your baby all the time this is the way to go,  they look but don't touch
__label__pos	The bendable features seems great,  but the spoon area that's suppose to hold food needs better design
__label__neg	It holds very little food and it's hard to scoop up food
__label__neu	My 14 months old son only used this spoon a few times
__label__neu	After he got the hang of feeding himself,  he prefers his regular Gerber or The First Year disposable spoons that he can more easily scoop up food
__label__neg	My son hates this swing
__label__neg	He never liked it
__label__neg	As mentioned from quite a few other people,  it is very difficult to remove a baby w/o hitting their head
__label__neg	"My son tore a neck muscle when he was delivered and b/c of that he ""tips"" to one side,  and the toys were always hitting him in the head"
__label__neg	It was awful
__label__neu	The swing does move quite quickly,  also
__label__neg	Setting #2 was all I could use for a long time b/c it moved so fast
__label__neg	It may fit some babies,  but definatley not mine
__label__neu	We got these becasue our new house has a brick fireplace with an elevated ledge
__label__neu	Our daughter was just learning to walk when we moved in and as part of our baby-proofing we decided we needed something for the fireplace
__label__neg	This was about the only option BRU had and it was a waste of money
__label__neg	It didn't fit together right and then the adhesive didn't stick to the brick
__label__pos	Plus when it was on our daughter seemed to be drawn to it
__label__pos	It never failed she wanted to go right to it and try to get it up
__label__neu	So we just took it up and she's been fine without anything on it
__label__neu	In fact,  she's pretty much left it alone since we took this off
__label__neg	These were terrible
__label__neg	They leaked everywhere
__label__pos	I must recommend the tri-flow
__label__neg	Don't bother with this one
__label__neg	It's too complicated to put on
__label__pos	Well,  its big and soft
__label__pos	It did support my back a bit
__label__neu	That's pretty much the end of the good points
__label__neg	I didn't sleep well at all
__label__neg	You need a really long neck to be comfortable using it
__label__neu	It dug into mine
__label__neu	Also,  I'm a short person (barely over 5 feet tall
__label__neg	Yet this seemed too short for me too
__label__neg	I can only imagine the difficulty a taller person must have getting it between their knees
__label__pos	I love that you can mix and match sounds with this sound soother - my girls like the womb sounds particularly
__label__neg	However,  this thing is not even CLOSE to being loud enough to qualify as white noise
__label__neg	You have to put the thing directly into an infant's crib (making the cord a choking hazard) in order for them to even hear it
__label__neg	If you are like me and need the white noise to keep your baby from waking up from other sounds in the house,  you need something a lot louder
__label__neu	The music goes off all the time
__label__neu	often waking us up in the middle of the night
__label__neg	Sometimes it's just 1 royal tune and sometimes it goes on playing tune after tune for who knows how long
__label__neu	And like another reviewer said
__label__neg	you can't turn it off,  you just have to take the thing apart
__label__neg	This also makes it really ineffective as a reward for the child b/c it will play music for my daughter without her doing anything in it
__label__neg	So,  she's getting rewarded for sitting there and not forming the reward association with doing something in the potty
__label__neu	She's also fearful of the big toilet,  so taking the removable seat off and using the base as a step stool right now is not an option
__label__neg	I have owned this set for about 6 months when today my 11 month old son was chewing on the coolin droolin teether in the set and it was leaking the fliud in his mouth
__label__pos	This is supposed to be made to be chewed on
__label__neg	I'm not sure how toxic the water in it is,  but its still shouldn't leak
__label__neu	No matter what is in there I don't want my son drinking it
__label__neu	I have contacted Sassy so hopefully they will do something about it
__label__neg	Very dissappointed
__label__neu	Update
__label__pos	I contacted Sassy,  and after apologizing,  they assured me that it was only distilled water inside and that they don't use anything harmful in their products
__label__pos	They replaced it free of charge
__label__neg	I am happy with the way they handled it,  but I wish it would've never happend
__label__neg	It wasn't worth the worry,  and trouble
__label__neu	Unfortunately I cannnot change my star rating but it would only go up to 2 stars
__label__pos	I purchased this mobile for my little one thinking it would be a slam dunk
__label__pos	Pretty colors,  remote control,  several classical tunes
__label__pos	well,  it would be perfect if it worked
__label__neg	It broke the same evening I put it together
__label__neg	Though the music played,  the mobile didn't go around as it was supposed to
__label__neg	I contacted Tiny Love and they sent me replacement parts,  but it still didn't work
__label__neu	I ended up returning it to BRU
__label__neu	Reading the other reviews I guess I was not the only one with the same problem
__label__neu	I do give it one star because it is pretty
__label__neu	but that's about it
__label__neg	After buying ten packs(on top of the ones that came with the bottles) of the nipples for these bottles,  we gave up and used our Advent bottles that we didn't want to use
__label__neg	For some reason,  no matter which store purchased at,  every nipple (Stage 1 and Stage 2) seemed to not be opened to allow milk to come out
__label__neu	Our daughter has some serious suction,  so I thought that the Stage 1 was already outgrown and tried the 2
__label__neg	These bottles and nipples have been just a waste of money for us
__label__neu	"I am sure that I can use a straight pin and open them more,  but ""you're not supposed to"
__label__neu	I bought this sling because my son would not sleep unless I was holding him
__label__neu	I work from home on the computer and I needed both hands to work,  so i thought this would help
__label__pos	It did,  as long as I was sitting down
__label__neg	It was very difficult to walk around with especially since my son was heavier than most babies his age
__label__neg	This sling is okay,  but i really didn't use it much because it hurt my back
__label__pos	I ended up using my front carrier more,  it supported my back better and still served the purpose of making my son feel secure
__label__neg	I would not recommend this product unless your baby is not heavy and you have a strong back
__label__neg	Being the excited new mom I opened this to get a feel for it and see how it would fit in our home and almost cut my finger sliding it open
__label__neg	I was shocked and then thought if I have not even used it and it does this I do not want
__label__neg	Plus if it did this to me then what about when I am washing my child
__label__neu	And I read all the instructions before attempting to play with it so I could do it correctly
__label__neu	Right back in the box and I drove back to the store the same day
__label__neu	got another brand
__label__neu	If you buy these,  you may want to buy locally in case you need to return them
__label__neg	I have seen raving reviews,  but I just don't see why
__label__neg	"These plugs just slip in to the socket and there is nothing to keep them in there like the ""dual release"" plugs (which we have and work"
__label__neu	Another option is to get the plate covers
__label__neu	These plugs are marketed for adults
__label__neu	"Even on the front of the box it notes ""push to pop out - save your nails"" and ""clip to vacuum cord when cleaning - never lose it again"
__label__neu	You won't break your nails on these plugs because they come out fairly easily - you don't even need to push their little button
__label__neg	My 10 month old twins can wiggle these out - and they didn't even see me install/remove them
__label__neg	So,  you still have the electrical hazard as well as a choking hazard
__label__neg	I do not recommend this product based on my personal experience
__label__neu	I will add that I shared my sentiments with Safety 1st and they did contact me to try to resolve my dissatisfaction
__label__neg	Cute looking but not very useful
__label__neu	My 9 month old daughter just rips it off the table and throws it on the floor
__label__neu	I had been using the Gerber bags for quite a while when I ran out and decided to try some of the Medela bags that came with my pump
__label__neg	I frequently just couldn't seem to get the bags to completely seal - and I had NEVER had this problem with the Gerber bags
__label__neg	I always ended up making a mess when trying to use the 'spout' at the bottom of the bag
__label__neg	And the worst part - I didn't realize the twist-ties were cutting into the sides of the bags on more than one occasion
__label__neg	I took the bag out of the freezer and into the fridge to thaw and ended up with a shelf full of breastmilk
__label__neg	Maybe these bags work for supermoms,  but they didn't work well for busy,  sloppy me
__label__neu	Apparently I can handle a ziploc baggie but not a twist tie
__label__neg	I had another model of this same product for my first child and it worked okay,  so I got another one for my upcoming second child
__label__neg	This one is VERY difficult to put together and the screw don't work well with the metal frame
__label__neg	Once together it is very flimsy and doesn't seem like it will hold up very long at all
__label__neg	Don't waste your money
__label__neg	Look for a more solid organizer
__label__neg	We tried this placemat along with the disposable ones and neither worked for us
__label__neg	This one was just too bulky to carry in her bag
__label__neg	it never folded back up to the size it was in the box
__label__neg	We also had trouble getting it to stick to tables
__label__neg	The least little bit of moisture or texture and it wouldn't work
__label__neg	On the rare occasions that we could get it to work then we had to deal with cleaning it
__label__neg	Wipes didn't work and napkins were even worse
__label__neg	Most times my husband or I had to head off to the restroom to try to get it clean enough to take home
__label__neg	It honestly was more trouble than it was worth
__label__neu	We finally just opted for cleaning wipes in her bag
__label__neu	we clean the heck out of her area of the table and then just let her have at it
__label__neu	When she's done we clean up her mess
__label__neg	I understand the theory behind this product but it needs works before it's a real benefit and must have item
__label__pos	This is a nice seat -- so comfy my 18-mo-old can use and stable enough that the 3yo also loves it
__label__pos	The handles offer added security for early potty use
__label__neu	We bought two of these to have on eat each toilet
__label__neg	However,  the less-used one recently split at the seams
__label__neu	Sadly it's past the return date
__label__neu	The two-piece design is terrific for trapping urine in the little grooves and also the cushy ring often slips off when this is hung up in the bathroom since you have to hang it by one of the little handles
__label__neg	My parents bought theMommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Tushie Potty Seatand I think it's much comfier,  much easier to clean AND it's only $10
__label__neg	Oh,  and it also has a hook that makes it super easy for the child to hang it up after use
__label__neg	I'd recommend that one instead
__label__neu	This is a love/hate relationshipLoveThat they work so well with bottle accessories and cups stuff later on
__label__pos	They tack nice and don't take up too much room
__label__pos	Fit right onto the Avent pump
__label__pos	Store nice and works well for freezing
__label__pos	Great stackability
__label__pos	Easy to write on in pencil and erase (to know which batch comes first
__label__neg	HateThey were hard to screw on (the flat tops to the bottoms and many times were on crooked
__label__neg	Leaked too much milk (and as any BFing mother knows
__label__neg	losing milk is well like losing money
__label__neg	I got this toy for my son to crawl after but it's the lamest toy ever
__label__neu	First,  I don't think it speaks english
__label__neu	It sounds like it's french or maybe spanish
__label__neg	It's so quiet I can't tell
__label__neg	Second,  it doesn't move very long or fast on carpet
__label__neg	It's a cute toy but it doesn't serve it's purpose and my 10mo old is certainly not entertained by it
__label__neu	Have to agree with the other reviews - wish I'd looked before I bought this
__label__pos	I think this is a pretty new product and when I saw it at BRU it seemed like a good idea
__label__neg	BUT,  it DOES NOT hold what it says it does
__label__neu	I've found the same thing other reviewers did - that you can only get about 12 bags in there
__label__neg	I'm very disapointed because I've generally liked the First Years products
__label__pos	The drying rack and the bottle warmer are great
__label__neg	This is the first that will be going back
__label__neg	The bed is beautiful but has scratches aand gouges on one side
__label__neu	Thank goodness is is the side facing the wall
__label__neu	If possible,  buy in person
__label__neg	I was so disappointed in this crib
__label__neg	We spent over $200 and it's all scratched and chipped
__label__neg	It's not very sturdy and the drop rail is a joke
__label__neu	You pull the side up and there are small notches at the bottom that is suppose to hold the rail up
__label__neg	Well,  if the baby grabs it and shakes it at all,  the rail comes right down
__label__neg	We have to leave the drawer open so the rail can't fall all the way down
__label__neg	Trying to work with Storkcraft is a joke too
__label__neg	They close at 3pm pacific time and they are on the west coast,  as are we
__label__neu	They want a crib number,  even though we know the crib name and can locate the crib on their web site by name and it has no number
__label__neg	The wood is light weight and really cheap
__label__neg	I highly doubt it's going to last longer than crib use
__label__neg	I've seen so much better built cribs for less money,  just not as pretty
__label__pos	So if you want pretty instead of quality
__label__pos	I guess this is an OK choice
__label__neu	Pros
__label__pos	InexpensiveEasy to inflateEasy to installWorks with a shower diverter knob on the end of the spoutCuteCons
__label__neg	Didn't last
__label__neg	Ours deflated after a few months and will not stay inflated longer than a day now
__label__neu	UPDATE
__label__pos	If I could,  I'd probably raise this to 3,  maybe even 4,  stars
__label__neu	Why
__label__pos	As I state in the title,  it's cute and does the job
__label__pos	It's also inexpensive
__label__neu	When ours died,  I looked around for something different
__label__neu	Something that fit the spout well (like this one does),  that stays clean inside (like this one),  that works with a shower diverter knob (like this one does
__label__neu	I didn't find anything decent under $16 and even that one was a gamble about fit
__label__pos	In the end,  I bought another one of these
__label__pos	At the price,  I can buy another if this one pops too
__label__pos	In the meantime,  it has everything I am looking for
__label__pos	I really like that this is a BPA-free sippy cup
__label__neg	Everyone seems to have different experiences with these things,  but we just couldn't get it to stop leaking
__label__neg	It is one of my least favorite sippy cups
__label__neg	This item is not top quality
__label__neg	I don't have too many of this company's other products,  so if this is an example of their quality than I don't think I will
__label__neg	First off the cover does not open without popping off the hinge and needing to be reattached,  the batteries only lasted through two cd's,  the volume doesn't get very high,  and it doesn't even fit on the side of our crib
__label__neu	Being in the baby business they should know that not all crib's are made the same
__label__neg	You are much better off just getting a simple boom box that play's cd's
__label__neg	Only holds a few bottles at a time
__label__neg	Gets the counter soaking wet because it leaks
__label__neg	Definently didn't work for me,  sent it back the next day
__label__neg	These are indeed a very cute idea,  but they don't really work
__label__neg	Ideal if your baby sits perfectly still at a diaper change,  but my baby never did
__label__neu	In fact,  I don't know of any who do
__label__neg	I spent more time trying to keep this thing in place,  and then the minute it slipped off,  he peed anyway
__label__neu	It's all part of the joy of having a baby boy
__label__neu	Better just to work quickly,  and you'll get quicker with practice
__label__neg	Seeing the previous reviews,  I wonder if the quality went down
__label__neg	I just got mine and they don't work as advertised
__label__neg	The spots disappear in warm water about 70
__label__neg	"They do not leave ""clean"" dogs behind"
__label__neg	I am not impressed at all
__label__pos	They are cute and are somewhat entertaining to my son,  so that is why it has two stars and not one
__label__neu	I heard so many good things about these bottles,  and after no success with the also praised Avent system,  I switched to Dr
__label__neu	Brown's
__label__neg	I had no luck with this product,  either,  and there were more parts to clean with this feeding system
__label__neu	My 2-month-old son spits up even more after feeding (sometimes twice) with the Dr
__label__neu	Brown bottles
__label__neg	I have not noticed any less gas,  either,  and the nipples flow way too fast for him,  even though I purchased the smallest size
__label__neg	I'm glad this product has worked for others,  but for me,  it was an expensive and failed experiment
__label__neu	I received this from my mother-in-law (she bought every conceivable accessory for our stroller
__label__pos	At first I liked this because it gave me more storage and cup holders
__label__neg	The only function that I actually used was the cup holders,  which don't work as well as a hard cup holder would
__label__neg	While I used this bag,  it caused more frustration than anything
__label__neg	It was always getting in the way and I was having to fold it up so that I could see what I was doing when folding it
__label__neu	The final straw came 6 months after using it
__label__neg	We had been having issues getting the stroller unfolded and I was considering sending the whole stroller back
__label__neu	As a last attempt,  I took the bag off,  and miracle of miracles
__label__pos	The stroller folds up fine
__label__neg	In my opinion,  don't waste your money,  just buy a standard cup holder
__label__neu	Got these for my son who loves bath time
__label__neg	At 8 months he didn't pay much attention to them and at 1 year he still doesn't
__label__neu	Occasionally he'll hold them in his hands and shake them-esp the one with little colored pebbles inside the plastic
__label__pos	He really only enjoys them when I do things like toss them in the water and make splashes
__label__neg	Otherwise,  doesn't hold his interest much
__label__neu	Cute concept just for my son he didn't find them interesting
__label__neg	I didnt really care for this
__label__neg	I couldnt tell when the bottle was ready and the light would go on and off and not warm the bottle or else get it to hot
__label__neu	Might be user error but I didnt care for it
__label__neg	Our 12 week old became so frustrated while using these bottles because the nipples would constantly collapse
__label__neu	The directions instruct you not to use an electric warmer or sterilizer
__label__neg	With a total of 6 parts per bottle cleaning,  warming and sterilizing are completely inconvenient
__label__neg	I'd suggest buying an individual bottle to try it out first
__label__neg	In our case,  these bottles weren't worth the money
__label__neu	I got rid of the Diaper Genie II and bought the Diaper Dekor instead
__label__pos	we've been very happy with the Diaper Dekor and recommend that
__label__pos	holds very few diapers -- must be changed every few days(Diaper Dekor holds at 5x as many diapers
__label__pos	and only needs to be changed weekly,  every 8-9 days)- refill does not last very long
__label__neg	gets expensive(Diaper Dekor refill lasts forever -- like 2 months,  I think
__label__neu	Way cheaper
__label__neu	what I hated most
__label__neg	I scratched up my hands every time I stuck a diaper in it
__label__neu	there is a plastic ring around the refill that sticks out
__label__neg	I honestly bled almost every time
__label__neg	It was awful
__label__pos	Diaper Dekor has a step pedal,  so hands never have to go inside
__label__neu	don't really have a problem with smell control with either of these,  but our 6mo old is exclusively breastfed and of course,  smells like roses
__label__neu	I've got a 2 week old
__label__neu	We started with the Playtex Nurser Bottles
__label__neg	Great bottles,  but the nipple was way too large for my son's mouth and he got a blister on his top lip
__label__neu	So I tried Gerber for newborns
__label__neg	smaller nipple,  but more bubbles and gas for baby
__label__pos	So I bought this VentAire because it has a smaller nipple AND is good for gas
__label__neg	But my son sucked on it for 5 minutes and got nothing out of it
__label__neu	Then I realized that the nipple doesn't just have a hole in it like other bottles do
__label__neu	It has the slit-type hole,  and the baby has to be squeezing the very tip if anything's going to come out
__label__neg	Well babies don't suck that way
__label__neu	They suck at the wider part,  naturally
__label__neu	But we solved our problem by taking the nipple off of the Gerber bottle and use it on the VentAire bottle
__label__neu	They tell you not to do this
__label__pos	But it works perfectly now
__label__pos	no gas,  no sucking problems
__label__neu	Whew
__label__neu	"I thought this ""Pacific"" was more of a blue color,  but it's more of a dark teal green"
__label__neg	Not happy but didn't want the hassle of an exchange
__label__neu	The reviews are true
__label__pos	it looks intimidating at first,  but then you get the hang of it
__label__neg	Of course,  it's basically just one long strip of stretchy fabric
__label__neg	i love the lavendar bedtime bath,  but these are too harsh for babys skin,  especially excema
__label__neg	go with aquaphor baby wash
__label__neg	The nipple is so long that my infant was gagging everytime i tried to feed her
__label__neg	It isn't great for infants that are nursing
__label__neu	My daughter had a fit when i tried to feed her
__label__neg	Not only was she gagging,  but she just didn't like the nipple
__label__pos	I used the playtex nurser bottle and she loved it
__label__pos	I have been using those bottles and nipples ever since,  and she is doing great when i need to switch from breast to bottle
__label__neu	We played with this toy some
__label__neg	All the different noices and rattles,  I guess,  are supposed to be educational,  I don't see much value in it from educational standpoint
__label__neu	OK,  the inchworm parts make different sounds,  but why
__label__neu	They all look the same other than the color variation which has nothing to do with the sounds
__label__pos	And the music is cute hence the two stars,  but it is only one song and soon becomes boring
__label__neg	Impossible for a baby,  even young toddler to turn it on
__label__neu	I eventually tought my son to whack it on the floor hard to turn the music on
__label__neg	Not too good solution
__label__neg	I do NOT recommend this toy,  unless you get it given
__label__neg	It does some,  but not worth the money to my opinion
__label__neg	After my husband and I put this together using the TERRIBLE directions,  we've been using this as a free-standing bassinet for the past 5 months (not attached to the bed,  as some people do
__label__pos	My daughter has been sleeping in it just fine
__label__neu	However,  we attempted to fold it up to take it with us on a weekend away from home recently
__label__neg	What a nightmare to collapse
__label__neg	Again,  the directions are of absolutely no help
__label__neg	It was impossible to get the whole thing into the carrying case and get it zipped up
__label__neg	Also,  this thing weighs a ton
__label__neu	I now realize I need to buy something else to use when travelling
__label__neg	How annoying
__label__neu	Bottom line
__label__pos	if you're going to set this up and never take it down,  it's fine (once you initially get it put together,  that is
__label__neg	However,   if you think you'd like to use this on an occasional overnight trip away from home,   forget it
__label__neu	I bought these for my newborn
__label__neg	He moves around too much and they fall off
__label__neg	One time,  the urine stream made it fall off
__label__neg	They are cute and a great idea,  but just not worth the money
__label__neg	They just don't stay on
__label__neu	I bought these after we moved because our new house had knobs on the front instead of on the counter surface
__label__pos	THey fit my oven knobs very loosely so my son likes to make them spin around and around
__label__neu	Also a few of my knobs pull off easily
__label__neu	My son just grabs hold of the covers and off they come,  both knob and cover
__label__pos	Then it's a neat toy with the knob rattling around inside the cover
__label__pos	They do keep him from turning on the stove so they do what their suppose to
__label__neg	I'm just not sure if it's worth it
__label__neu	It probably depends on your stove
__label__neg	This ink kit is quite messy to use
__label__neg	The ink is black,  smears easily,  and is hard to wipe off the baby's feet
__label__neg	I bought a pink hand/footprint stamp pad and found that to be much more effective
__label__neu	I recommend finding an ink pad just for ease of use
__label__neg	I found the ultimate crib sheet to be much more trouble than it's worth
__label__neu	Lifting my daughter's mattress takes no effort
__label__neu	it's made of  lightweight foam
__label__neu	As a result,  changing her sheets is also super easy
__label__neu	I just have to lift the mattress,  and it takes two seconds
__label__neg	On the other hand,  snapping all the ties on the ultimate crib sheet takes bending over the crib for five solid minutes (plus,  the manufacturer recommends snapping the snaps before every wash,  which means snap on crib,  unsnap,  snap again before wash,  unsnap,  snap on crib
__label__neg	So,  if you have a foam mattress in a corner of the room,  I'd suggest just getting normal sheets and some of those stay-dry liners
__label__neu	If you have a coil mattress and keep the crib in the center of the room,  then by all means,  try the ultimate crib sheet
__label__neg	The sheet seems to be made well though it fits a loosely
__label__neg	Despite being made  of cotton and having a 220 thread count,  it feels quite rough
__label__neu	The only cotton crib sheets I've found so far that feel smoother are Laura Ashley
__label__neu	I ordered blue and in the picture it has a woven or printed dot pattern
__label__neg	That's not what I received
__label__neu	I received solid blue
__label__neu	I am a first time mom and loved the baby einstein line
__label__pos	This is a great product - sturdy,  good-looking,  but there are better products out there
__label__pos	I own this one,  but my mom bought one for her house that has so many better features
__label__neg	My daughter got bored with these toys FAST
__label__neu	And lets face it,  they get dirty
__label__neu	Evenflo has removable and REPLACABLE toys
__label__neu	You can get new ones
__label__neu	And this Baby Einstein one needs the baby to be pretty tall to start using it
__label__pos	Evenflo starts much lower for shorter babies and it lets them jump a little too - something kids love to do
__label__neg	Good product,  but better ones out there for less money
__label__neg	The seller of this product is wonderful,  but the Maya Wrap is not for me or my little guy
__label__neg	I guess I am just not a fan of ring slings
__label__neu	I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews and this is the first baby carrier I decided to buy
__label__neu	My baby boy (4 weeks old when I received the sling) always wants to be held so I was looking forward to being able to hold him all the time and nurse him hands free
__label__neg	First,  I am small framed and the sling kept sliding down so the ring was too low
__label__neg	Then when I tried one of the positions my baby either kept hitting his head on the ring or grabbing onto it
__label__neg	The fabric is not soft and comfortable,  it is a bit rough,  and the sling does not feel comfortable (for me) when on
__label__neg	"But most importantly I don't like the fact that with all the positions except the nursing one,  my baby would have to have his legs crunched up in the ""frog"" position - he hates his legs being confined like that"
__label__neu	I returned it and ended up buying the Moby Wrap which I love - fabric is soft and comfortable,  and my baby can have his legs out in almost all the positions
__label__pos	It is also much easier to figure out how to use and to get him in and out of
__label__neg	The lids are so hard to screw on straight
__label__neg	You think they are on tight,  then when you hold them up at eye level you will often find that they are on crooked
__label__neg	Also when you twist the lid open or closed,  it is hard to get a good grip because the gripping area is very thin
__label__neg	They are expensive too,  a total waste of money
__label__neu	Who wants a disposable system where you have to keep (and wash) the lids
__label__neu	The last thing you need is to have to put everything down to check a bottle constantly
__label__neg	Every time myself or my wife tried to warm a bottle in this thing,  it either came out too hot or too cold
__label__neg	Having to constantly check the bottle became too much of a hassle and we simply quit using this warmer
__label__neg	Despite following the instructions to a tee,  the bottles NEVER came out perfect
__label__neg	We either had to re-heat the bottle or let it cool down before giving it too the baby
__label__neu	To make things short,  I'll say this
__label__neu	Use the stove or microwave
__label__neg	Once you get your child into a reasonably predictable routine,  you can warm bottles at a reasonable time and easily without having to waste time and money on the First Years Quick Serve Bottle Warmer
__label__pos	this is a good toilet ring,  but ONLY if you have the smallest,  round toilet seats
__label__neg	the package blatantly lies in saying that it fits elongated seats - it will fit,  but it'll also slide around and leave large gaps
__label__neu	my home has a mix of elongated/round seats,  and i found that the baby bjorn rung is the best for the larger bowls
__label__neu	we use that for our elongated seats,  and this ring for the tiny toilet that's in the hallway
__label__neu	otherwise this ring - which can not be adjusted to fit - will slide around a lot and feel very unstable when you're trying to toilet train
__label__neg	We didn't have this toy for long because it would not clip onto anything
__label__neg	I bought initially for the carseat on the road,  (can't have the bar up while driving) but it wouldn't clip on to the carseat
__label__neg	It also didn't clip on to his bassinet
__label__neg	There was no point in having this toy,  so we returned the item
__label__neg	As other people said it would collapse easily
__label__neu	Instead I use the Lamaze
__label__neu	Link Along Friends
__label__pos	I clip those to the hood of the carseat while driving
__label__pos	He loves to play with those toys
__label__neg	"This is the second time I've ordered ""The First Years"" cups and gotten a cheap knockoff ""Learning Curve"
__label__neu	They are not the same
__label__neg	The Learning Curve is not as well insulated,  the pictures come off easily,  and they leak horribly
__label__neg	I returned this set because I kept the first set and was terribly dissapointed
__label__neu	They need to CORRECT THE DESCRIPTION of this item
__label__neg	These worked good for about 3 weeks and they started to leak
__label__neu	I went to the Avent website and they said that I was overtightening the bottles and that was causing the leak
__label__neg	Well less tightening did not help
__label__neg	Don't waste money
__label__pos	I am using the Playtex Premium Nurser now and it's much better
__label__neg	I NEVER REALLY COULD GET COMFORTABLE WITH THIS THIS SLING
__label__neu	I THINK MY DAUGHTER IS TOO SMALL
__label__neg	WITH ALL THE FABRIC IT JUST SEEMS AWKWARD
__label__neu	MUCH PREFER THE FRONT CARRIER
__label__neg	I think that I've tried every bag that I have found and have been disappointed with all of them
__label__neg	These were just about the worst
__label__neu	My daughter was born prematurely and never really got the hang of breastfeeding
__label__neu	I wanted her to recieve all of the benefits of breastmilk so I pumped
__label__neu	I have pumped everday since the day she was born btwn 5 and 8 times a day
__label__neg	I went through ALOT of bags (I use bottles now) and these were a pain
__label__neg	They were small,  thin,  punctured easily,  and those twist ties (although pumping directly into the bag is a great concept) were just a pain in the butt
__label__neg	I love Medela's pumps (I own the Pump in Style Advanced,  a seperate manual pump,  and used the Lactina hospital pump for 3 months),  I like their storage bottles,  I even like their nipple cream,  but these bags need some more work put into them
__label__neg	This is the worst
__label__neg	We suffered with the terrible static and screeching for five months
__label__neu	Recently went out and bought the Sony Baby Call 27 channel monitor
__label__neu	It isn't even in the same league
__label__neu	With the voice activation feature you hear nothing,  I repeat nothing,  unless the sound registers over a certain decibel
__label__pos	Amazing
__label__pos	It was definitely worth the $50
__label__neg	Just wish we never registered for this product
__label__pos	We had to get some of these for the bottles
__label__neu	Like
__label__pos	1) Removable handles,  2) BPA FreeDislike
__label__neg	1) Ridiculously expensive,  2) Fidgety extra parts that do nothing except require cleaning and slow you down when you try to fill it
__label__neu	3) LEAKS
__label__neg	No valve except the hole in the cup spout
__label__neg	4) No valve except in the cup spout
__label__neu	Our daughter chewed on one and the hole got a LOT bigger and leaks like crazy now - you can buy replacements for $7 for a pair
__label__neu	My wife bought a bunch of these and matching bottles in the big BPA scare last year
__label__neg	Now there are MANY better and much cheaper options
__label__neu	I recommend anyone investigate those first
__label__pos	This is the ONLY item I actually bought when I was pregnant,  as opposed to receiving it as a gift
__label__neu	I thought it was a must-have,  and the best of the best,  so I spent $119 on it
__label__neu	It was ok while my baby was just weeks old,  but once he was 10 and 12 pounds,  I couldn't walk more than a couple blocks without very bad lower back pain
__label__neg	I'm average weight and height,  but this carrier was very painful
__label__neu	My husband wears it occasionally because the baby can face forward,  which the baby loves,  but I don't wear it any more
__label__neu	I bought another model that places more weight on your hips
__label__neg	This was great,  until we put it in the dishwasher
__label__neg	It says top shelf dishwasher safe,  but after running it through the the temperature sticker started coming off and the top 'cap' no longer held in place
__label__neu	One of the benefits of this over a bowl is that the lid keeps the bottle being warmed from floating out of the water
__label__neu	This helps the bottle warm faster since all of the milk is submerged
__label__neu	We tried contacting Firt Years to get the top replaced and were told they were not able to and to return it to the store
__label__neg	Surprised at the hassle and the warmer now serves limited purpose
__label__pos	Typically,  it works alright
__label__neg	However I have problems with the cutting mechanism almost every time I empty it,  it will only partially cut through the plastic (and that was on the stage 1
__label__neg	And after I empty it,  I re-tie a knot and twist the top and the next time I put a diaper in,  it just spins and spins with out actually tying up the diaper
__label__neg	This product is horrible
__label__pos	When we first plugged it in it worked ok
__label__neg	Within hours we were getting horrible static
__label__neg	We tried all different places in our house to plug it in and it didn't get any better
__label__pos	We finally found two places where the static isn't THAT bad and we now leave the monitors there,  plugged in and turned on ALL the time
__label__neu	One night,  when the baby was fussing and my husband was trying to get some sleep,  I turned of the monitor in the babies room and we found out that the recievers will then pick up a country radio station
__label__neu	Maybe that's the cause of the static
__label__neg	Horrible product
__label__neg	Do not waste your money unless you like to be disappointed or if you like to return products to the stores
__label__neg	Can't someone engineer a pouring system for these bags
__label__neg	It's such a hassle to poor the milk from the flabby plastic bag into a bottle without spilling some and nearly impossible if you are stuck with your infant in one arm and need to do this one-handed
__label__neg	For the price,  Medela should really come up with something better
__label__neu	I'm all about new and up dating,  even though it's on 1 child,  I like to research and know that it's the best or at least the close to it
__label__neg	I tried the avent first,  it's ok,  but I'm not fond of the plain look
__label__neu	I tried gerber,  playtex and so on
__label__neu	Then I bought some Dr
__label__neu	Brown
__label__neg	It was ok for awhile then things starting getting messy
__label__neg	If you hate washing dishes,  this ain't for ya
__label__neg	Now this bottle is very difficult
__label__neg	It has so much things you have to assemble
__label__neg	If you put just a tad more milk the lid will leak and it's not easy trying to wash that skinny tube
__label__neg	sigh)  And the nipple is soft and all but my baby needs to something that he can get a grip
__label__neu	If you are looking for the best bottle or nipple,  I recommend NAM
__label__neu	They came out with a new bottle and nipple
__label__pos	It has fun colors,  very attractive,  you can tell that the bottle is working from the air you hear coming out of the bottom suction and the awesome nipple that babies can actually get a grip on
__label__pos	If I had ten hands I'd give it (10) thumbs up
__label__neu	From what I've seen,  there are basically 3 methods used to eliminate/reduce gas in bottles
__label__neu	collapsible liners,  one-way vents,  and open airways
__label__neu	We've tried various brands that use all 3 methods
__label__neu	These bottles are an example of one-way vents - the base is designed to let air flow in but prevent fluid from flowing out in the opposite direction
__label__pos	They do an OK job preventing bubbles in the formula,  but they have two main problems
__label__neg	1) they tend to leak if you don't assemble correctly,  and also if shaken or if the membrane becomes a bit worn
__label__neg	2) The design of the vent requires some negative pressure to allow the air to flow into the bottle
__label__neu	This means a slight resistance to your baby's suckling effort
__label__neg	The last thing you want when addressing any feeding problem is resistance to your baby's suckling
__label__neu	We found the most effective feeding design is the open airway used by Dr Browns bottles
__label__neu	So if you're looking for something to address a colic/feeding problem,  that's the way to go
__label__neu	But as previously mentioned,  the best advice is to buy one of each and find what works for your little one
__label__neg	The tiny lip on the nipple does not count as breakthrough technology in preventing the baby from swallowing air
__label__neu	I recommend Dr
__label__neu	Brown's bottles
__label__pos	They cost more,  but they're worth it
__label__neu	I registered for this item and received it as a gift,  why,  I don't know
__label__neu	I never really even travel by car too often
__label__neu	I decided to try it out the one time I did travel,  my son was 4 months old
__label__neg	I plugged it in and waited and waited and waited and the item never ever heated up
__label__neu	It just remained cold
__label__neu	I tried to take it back to Babies R Us but the return time had already passed so they wouldn't take it back
__label__neg	My advice on this item is,  don't buy it,  even if it does work,  you will probably never use it
__label__pos	It is a great looking backpack and works if you only need to go somewhere for a short period of time
__label__neg	It doesn't hold very much and the top doesn't close like you think it should
__label__neg	Save your money
__label__neg	You can heat a bottle faster under hot running tap water or by heating a bowl of water in the microwave and sitting the bottle in it
__label__neg	This bottle warmer is definitly not a necessary item
__label__neg	It is expensive and it takes too long to heat a bottle
__label__neu	Okay,  so I chintzed out and bought the cheaper doorway jumper
__label__neg	I wish I hadn't
__label__neg	the spring on this thing is so stiff that there's no way that my baby could make it jump
__label__neg	She just sits there dangling and looking unhappy
__label__neg	If you want to avoid disappointment,  definitely buy the more expensive brand
__label__neg	Unless you have 20 minutes to kill while your baby is screaming for a bottle,  you don't want this
__label__neu	I first used this on a venture to BRU for a Grandparent's Day Breakfast and while Grandma was sitting in on a 529 seminar,  my daughter suddenly discovered that she was beyond famished - so up we go out to the car to warm up a bottle
__label__neu	Now,  supposedly this warmer can be used with Dr
__label__neg	Brown's bottles but the combination didn't work for us
__label__neg	First of all,  the bottle has to be positioned in the warmer a certain way so that it presses a safety latch to keep the warmer on
__label__neg	Unless the bottle is a regular generic bottle with a gallon of fluid inside,  it won't keep the heating latch engaged
__label__neg	I had to sit there and continuously push the bottle down onto the latch AND then after 10 minutes,  the bottle was still ice cold
__label__neg	I have no idea how to warm a bottle in the car and have no reccomendations,  but I will tell you that this mini blood pressure machine will do nothing to benefit the appetite of an impatient child when she's hungry
__label__neg	this product did not work for us i was very disappointed we are using the adiri bottles and it didnt even make the bottle warm i tried every thing
__label__neu	I agonized over whether to buy this cheaper pump or go straight to one of the high-end ($250+) models
__label__neu	In an effort to save money I started with this one
__label__neg	But I quickly realized I'd made a mistake -- it took *forever* to even get one ounce of milk
__label__pos	I ended up getting the Medela Pump In Style and loved it
__label__neg	I just wish I'd gone straight to that one and saved my money on this one
__label__neu	For those of you who are trying to decide between this or a more expensive model,  here are my two cents
__label__neu	TRY THIS ONE IF
__label__neu	You have a very abundant milk supply- You only plan to pump one or twice a month- You wouldn't mind giving your baby formula if you had to be away from her for an extended periodINVEST THE MONEY IN A HIGHER-END MODEL IF
__label__neu	You're going back to work- Your milk supply is medium to low- You plan to pump more than two or three times per month- You are opposed to giving your baby any formula,  ever (with a higher quality pump you could build up reserve breastmilk to have in case of an emergency)Also,  it's worth noting that most of the more expensive models can be safely re-used by other people so could be sold to someone else when you're done (unlike this one
__label__neu	Got this as a gift at my baby shower
__label__pos	It's ok but not something one needs
__label__neg	I actually stopped using mine now because of the hassle
__label__neu	Read on
__label__neu	If it's winter and you want this wipe then go right ahead BUT be sure to have the wipes VERY CLOSE to the baby
__label__neu	I initially had mine about 6 ft away from baby so my husband grabbed the wipe and passed it to me while I was changing my son
__label__neg	Thing is that the once warm wipe became cold in approx 3 to 5 seconds,  even if we crumpled it up in the palm of our hands
__label__neg	Eventually I found a better place to keep it next to baby,  however the wipes kept getting stuck in the bottom part of the warmer so i eventually got tired of lifting the cover and pushing the wipes through to the top
__label__neg	This was just too much trouble for me
__label__pos	My son has never flinched when touched by the wipes or signaled in any other way of the wipes being cold
__label__neg	If you're wondering if this should be an item on the 'must have ' list then the answer is NO WAY
__label__neg	I BOUGHT THIS FOR TEN DOLLARS AND WHEN I INSTALLED IT,  I REALIZED THAT IF I JUST BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE CHEAP PLASTIC PICTURE FRAMES THAT STAND ON THEIR OWN,  IT WOULD DO THE SAME THING
__label__neg	I BOUGHT A PANORAMIC SIZE FRAME AND RESTED THE STANDING PART UNDER MY TV AND NOW IT'S BLOCKED
__label__neg	THE FRAME WAS ONLY TWO DOLLARS AND IS MORE STURDIER THAN THIS FLIMSY PIECE OF PLASTIC
__label__neg	If you are only going to be pumping once in a blue moon,  then this is a great pump for you
__label__neg	I found it to be an incredible nusance,  so I borrowed a friend's Medela electric pump
__label__neg	Never used this Back to Work pump more than twice after using hers
__label__neg	Why spend a longer amount of time pumping that you have to (and yes it does take longer even though the manual says their stats say otherwise
__label__neu	With our next child,  I will definitely be buying electric
__label__pos	I was so excited when I recieved this tub thinking it would last for years
__label__neg	Well,  first you can NOT use it in your home bathtub,  because the suction cups will not adhere to a non-slip surface
__label__neg	Most tubs are non-slip,  that's what the little bumps are for in your tub
__label__pos	This was fine though,  I planned to use it on our kitchen counter
__label__neg	"No matter how hard I pressed on the middle ""locking"" device water always leaked out onto the counter and floor"
__label__neg	This tub is more trouble than it's worth
__label__pos	We received this toy at our baby shower,  and were thrilled to get it
__label__neg	However,  when we first started using it with baby,  we noticed that it began to say the wrong color associated with the wrong foot
__label__neu	we would press the red foot,  and it would say yellow
__label__neu	or press the white foot and it would say purple
__label__neg	Sometimes now,  I'll just be walking by it,  without pushing anything,  and it will shout out a random color
__label__neg	Obviously,  this isn't teaching our daughter anything
__label__pos	I also loved the idea for this product
__label__pos	My daughter was born in July and I liked the idea of her napping in it on our porch with the netting all zipped up
__label__neg	However,  the seat never supported her enough
__label__neg	She wasn't a very big or a very small baby,  but she kept falling over to one side in the seat
__label__neg	And the toys - and what they are attached to -  were always out of her reach,  but in her line of sight
__label__neg	When she could support herself better,  she was too tall for it
__label__neg	The cool tent feature makes the babies outgrow it so much more quickly than a regular open bouncy seat
__label__neu	"I ended up leaving it at my mom's for a ""back up"
__label__neg	And for the price compared to other bouncy seats (like the $20 one I bought and my daughter loved),  it was a big time waste of money
__label__pos	We purchased over 20 Avent bottles for my daughter before she was born because we had heard so many great things about the bottle and also saw the good reviews
__label__neu	My daughter took the Avent for about two weeks
__label__neu	then she all of a sudden decided that she didn't want to take it anymore
__label__neu	We tried every single bottle on the market and the only bottle that she will take is the Playtex Deluxe Nurser
__label__pos	The nipple is soft on her gums and it acts exactly like a real breast nipple acts
__label__neu	My advise to new or expectant parents is
__label__neg	don't buy a lot of any one bottle until you are sure that your baby is going to latch on well
__label__neu	Trust me
__label__neg	I have over $100 in unused Avent bottles that are collecting dust
__label__neg	This is hands down the worst sippy cup I have every found for my child - as a drinking vessel it is completely non-functional
__label__neg	The spout is hard plastic so beverages can't be sucked out at all
__label__neg	Instead,  the cup has to be lifted right over the child's head in order for them to get any liquid out
__label__neg	In addition,  there is no way to travel with it because it doesn't have a top to keep it from leaking everywhere
__label__neg	It really is the worst,  most useless design
__label__pos	It earns one star from me only because it looks good and is fun for playing with in the bath
__label__pos	When breastfeeding,  these are highly recomended
__label__neg	The problem with a breastfeeding mom is,  they do not fit standard US breast pumps
__label__neg	So basicly you have to pump into one bottle,  then transfer into this one (this causes a problem for those of us who don't produce quite enough milk --- every drop that is lost in transfer is crutial
__label__neg	Then you are faced with the leaking problem
__label__neu	The directions say to wet the rim to prevent leaking
__label__neg	Well,  sometimes that works and sometimes it dosen't
__label__neu	Again,  I am reminded of how delicate every drop of milk was
__label__neg	Sometimes these bottles will taunt you
__label__neu	I would test the bottle before giving it to baby
__label__neu	then after I was convinced it wouldn't leak
__label__neg	baby would begin to suck and would instantly be drownded
__label__neg	And there you are,  wasted milk,  and a hungry baby who is drenched,  and really mad by the time you get another bottle ready and her clothes changed
__label__pos	The day I stopped breast feeding I switched to playtex vent aire,  which only leak once in a blue moon,  if you dont put it together right
__label__neg	When using these bottles with my newborn,  stage 1 flow was very fast for her
__label__neg	The nipples are very hard (not like the breast at all
__label__neg	She would get alot of gas when using these bottles
__label__pos	I switched to Platex Ventaire and we both loved them
__label__pos	Those bottles are a hundred times better
__label__pos	I bought this instead of a high chair for the convenience factor and it is really cute
__label__neg	It is a HASSLE to assemble the straps,  and once they are assembled,  they don't securely lock into place
__label__neg	The straps hang on my a tiny hole,  and at the right angle can be pulled out,  which I find dangerous for baby
__label__neg	The point of straps is for safety,  and they should not be easily removed from their base
__label__neu	"We kept it anyway,  but had to ""rig"" it ourselves by locking the straps in with our own invention"
__label__neg	Good Luck figuring this thing out
__label__pos	I thought this bottle looked cute,  and it seemed easier to clean
__label__pos	My son did use it,  but I found several issues with using it
__label__neg	There is no good way to warm with a bottle warmer
__label__neg	If you put it in the warmer with the cap on,   the cap will fill with formula
__label__neg	If you put it in upright without the cap,  the bottom opens up and spills into the warmer
__label__neg	Trying to mix formula in the bottle also didn't work well
__label__neg	Even with the cap on liquid leaks out of the nipple
__label__neg	Because of this,  even filling the bottle with ready made formula is messy
__label__neg	I was very disappointed and returned this bottle
__label__pos	I'll stick with my Soothies
__label__neg	On the first one I received only one of the two clips made a clicking sound when inserted into the buckle and you had to push *really* hard to get the clips in
__label__neg	So I called Britax and they sent me a replacement buckle and on the replacement buckle,  neither one of the clips made a clicking noise when inserted into the buckle and again I had to push really hard to get them the buckle and I am not convinced they are really locked in - guess you wouldn't really know until an accident happened
__label__neu	Well,  I am not taking the chance,  so back it goes
__label__neu	When I called Britax about the second buckle - they told me it was normal for there not to be a clicking noise when the clips go into the buckle
__label__neu	Yeah right,  I'm not waiting for an accident to find out whether the clip is really locked into the buckle or not
__label__neg	We returned it because we really were unhappy with it
__label__neg	Our baby would slip down and it was akward for her to sleep in
__label__pos	"We purchased the ""First Years Air Flow"" sleep positioner instead and love it"
__label__neg	I found the nipples EXTREMELY hard for a new born baby to suck on
__label__pos	I used the Playtex bottles w/ the disposable liner and it made my life much easier
__label__pos	In the playtex starter pack,  there are also nipples of different sizes and shapes so your baby can decide whe one she likes
__label__neu	I had recieved this as a promotional item at Babiesrus so I didn't have to pay anything for it
__label__pos	Well,  I got what I DIDN'T pay for
__label__neg	This thing does not stick to car windows and even if I made it stick,  it would fall down before we even got out of the garage
__label__neg	Looking at the price of this item,  it's better to just spend a few extra $$$ and get something that will actually work
__label__neg	The squirt holes are recessed so the toys can't be completely emptied of water
__label__neg	They are very hard to squeeze anyway so not much fun
__label__neg	No matter how hard I try to empty these toys some water remains,  and a couple of days after a bath some mildew or scum came out of one
__label__neg	Beyond yucky
__label__neg	I will never buy another squirty bath toy
__label__neg	This monitor is not worth the extra price
__label__neg	"We often get ""out-of-range"" beeps and static for no reason"
__label__neu	The channels all seem to give the same result
__label__neg	So,  if you live close to people on cellphones or cordless phones (we live in a townhouse) it can be very frustrating
__label__neu	We had received one of these as a baby gift
__label__neg	First it was too big
__label__neg	After my daughter had grown into it,  she was able to get her arms out and it was never very snug,  so she wouldn't like it very much
__label__neg	It's not a bad product,  but it just doesn't work as well as a blanket
__label__neg	I was disappointed with this product when I went to install it on my seats
__label__pos	The upper strap is velcro and manages to fit okay,  but the bottom strap has to be placed around your seat and pulled down
__label__neu	My seat belt attaches at the bottom of my seat,  and this strap covers that--but I haven't determined if this is a problem or just a cosmetic issue
__label__neg	I have a trailblazer (06) and the mat is too short so it rolls up on the sides and doesn't fit properly
__label__neu	It may fit better in a small car,  but I wouldn't know
__label__neg	Also,  I was thinking I would place one on my middle seat so my kids in the very back seat (third row) wouldn't mess up the back of the middle seat
__label__neg	No go,  as the seats are not individual
__label__pos	So these mats would only work on bucket seats that are on the smaller side
__label__neg	I used this diaper pail when I had my first daughter a couple of years ago and I did not like it at all
__label__neg	I thought it was very difficult to use
__label__neg	until you get used to it)  It didn't contain the smell well at all
__label__neg	The refills were a pain to put in and like another reviewer said it twisted when it wanted to
__label__neg	The lid also kept coming off of mine
__label__pos	I threw this out and bought the safety 1st odorless diaper pail which I find contains the odor much better
__label__neu	We used this once
__label__neg	It was just not needed
__label__neu	roll some receiving blankets and viola
__label__neg	I would not spend the money on this again
__label__pos	I love how soft and cuddly this changing pad cover is
__label__pos	I also appreciate how many colors it comes in
__label__neg	What I am disappointed with is the durability
__label__pos	I have 3 of these and have used them for just over a year
__label__neg	They are totally falling apart at the elastic
__label__neu	"Now,  keep in mind that we use disposable ""chucks"" (those blue hospital disposable under pads) on top of this terry cloth changing pad"
__label__neu	It makes it less messy (especially early on) and doesn't require washing as much
__label__neu	I also washed them in cold water with Baby Dreft detergent,  hung them to dry and rotated the 3 covers that we have
__label__pos	While it is a nice product while it lasts,  I just expected them to be more durable
__label__pos	I bought this tub before my son was born,  thinking it looked great and I could use it in the kitchen sink
__label__neg	I do like that I can use it in the sink,  but he's not a super long baby and his little feet always get stuck in the grooves where the tub folds
__label__neg	It doesn't hold much water,  either
__label__neg	I wish I had read reviews before I bought it,  because now,  after only 2 months,  I'm just going to replace it and throw it away
__label__neg	What a waste
__label__neu	I'm an organization freak,  so naturally I tried this out for bath toys to be able to drip dry
__label__neg	I'd give this 0 stars if I could
__label__neg	The suction cups do not stick to anything in a bathroom that's tile
__label__neg	Unless you want to hang it in the tub itself (which is then totally in the way) the don't stick
__label__neg	I tried everywhere and in all my bathrooms and other surfaces and it just doens't work
__label__pos	But hey if you want to drill holes somewhere and hang with screws then it should do the trick
__label__neu	I'd send it back,  but it would cost more to ship it than I paid for it in the first place
__label__pos	Have had one of these for a long time
__label__neg	Notice I said one because we won't buy another
__label__neu	This thing has a few  major flaws
__label__neu	First and foremost,  it is a pain in
__label__neu	to clean
__label__neg	It has so many parts too clean and keep track of
__label__neu	lid,  bottle,  outside straw,  middle straw,  and bottom straw
__label__neg	Each piece has to be taken apart each time for cleaning since the straws are small and the outside one is actually closed at the top to prevent leaking you pretty much have to hand wash and scrub out with a tiny pipe cleaner like brush (we use the one from the Dr
__label__neu	Brown's bottles
__label__neg	Putting it back together feels like you are building a model airplane (if you can manage to keep track of all the parts
__label__neg	Secondly,  twist closing the lid is always a challenge
__label__neg	It isn't always easy to tell if you have it on right until it leaks
__label__neg	Taking it off is even worse because it seems to lock down and get stuck
__label__neg	The last thing is that sometimes when my kid is drinking and the straw part flips out of his mouth some of the liquid goes flying across too
__label__pos	I do give it credit for having a straw that folds down to stay clean and if you get it on right it doesn't leak
__label__neg	As mentioned,  I didn't and wouldn't buy this again
__label__pos	It's a neat idea
__label__neu	the problem is
__label__neg	the replacement bags cost too much and don't justify the convenience
__label__neu	Honestly,  my husband and I use the plastic bags that the daily newspaper comes in
__label__neu	They are slim and hold about 7-10 diapers
__label__neu	At the end of the day,  we toss them out into the garage
__label__neu	end of story
__label__neg	If you really need this kind of doodad,  there is another type out there where you can use your own plastic bag
__label__neu	that's much better than this deal
__label__neg	We found this to be useless
__label__neg	not because it's a bad product but rather why waste the money when a bath sponge will do
__label__neu	My baby loves to bathe and lays very calmly in the bath
__label__neu	But she gets cold easily so we bought a big bath sponge instead
__label__neu	We lay her on it and she stays much warmer
__label__pos	The best part is that the sponge is less than $4 and you can use it anywhere- the kitchen sink,  tub,  etc
__label__neu	Before buying make sure the length is long enough for your rail
__label__neg	I have  a sleigh bed crib and this does not fit the rail
__label__neg	It's not long enough to reach the velcro on both sides
__label__pos	It fits older style cribs but not sleigh types
__label__neu	Will add customer pic to product for example
__label__neu	1
__label__neg	Too heavy to lug around in diaper bag
__label__neu	2
__label__neg	Too big to fit in average size diaper bag
__label__neu	3
__label__neg	Gets activated with the slightest bump - not good if baby is not ready for a bottle
__label__neu	4
__label__neu	One time use then you have to pull out a pot and boil the thing,  then lay it to cool
__label__neg	I wouldn't have bought this product if I had known what a pain it would be
__label__pos	This was the only rail we found that would fit our convertible cribs and seems to be safe
__label__pos	From that perspective it is a great product
__label__neg	My disappointment with it is that the manufacturer left it to each and every customer to deal with the unfinished wood on their own
__label__neg	The wood is completely unfinished and it comes with manufacturing dust on it
__label__neg	The moment we wiped it with a lightly damp cloth,  the grain in the unfinished wood raised up and we had to sand it
__label__neg	We had to order non-toxic urethane just for this rail because non-toxic urethane is not carried in any of the local hardware stores,  and then we had to stay up nights to do all the work of sanding,  painting,  sanding,  painting
__label__neg	This product is completely unusable without a finish on it
__label__neg	A toddler who tends to chew things would quickly end up with a rough rail that snags his clothes and scrapes his skin,  and the unfinished rail is impossible to clean if a kid throws up on it
__label__neg	It is not a good product if every single customer has to go through all the trouble of ordering non-toxic finish and sanding and finishing it themselves
__label__neu	This is the sort of thing that can be quickly and cheaply done at the factory
__label__neu	The manufacturer should have offered a finish as an option
__label__pos	My son absolutely loves this mirror
__label__pos	He laughs and smiles at himself
__label__pos	He does not like riding in the car without this mirror
__label__neu	As for me,  I have my pros and CONS
__label__pos	My pro is I can see my son at all times
__label__neu	I feel much safer knowing I can see him
__label__neu	Also,  it's fun to look up and see his beautiful face as he recognizes himself and that he is truly gorgeous
__label__pos	The remote is convenient to turn on music if he starts to fuss
__label__neu	My cons are as follows
__label__neg	The remote is great,  but it requires you to leave the mirror on,  which doesn't allow long battery life
__label__neg	My mirror looked a little hazy when I installed it,  thinking it was just finger prints,  I left it until this week
__label__pos	It ONLY took me between 5-10 minutes to unhook it from the car
__label__neg	When I tried to clean it (first water,  then window spray,  then some windshield wax)  it went from hazy,  to more hazy,  to scratched,  to beyond scratched,  to wiping some of the mirror away
__label__neg	Well,  I decided I'd go without it since I don't feel like wasting $20 again
__label__neu	That was until my son was in the car crying because he is used to seeing his beautiful face
__label__neg	I think I may try a different brand mirror this time
__label__pos	This adorable little turtle (so cute my kids fought over it) does not keep an accurate temperature
__label__neg	In a tub full of ~100 degree water,  he consistently read 72-74 degrees
__label__neu	Tried resetting,  no luck
__label__neg	If I didn't already have a pretty good idea about the water temp,  I could have really scalded my kids
__label__neg	Cute,  but unsafe,  unsafe,  unsafe
__label__neg	Returning it immediately
__label__neg	This product was a gift and it is more trouble then its worth
__label__neg	I only used it for about a month and it was such a pain
__label__neg	I would rather just empty the trash can once a day then mess with this thing
__label__neg	The odor was still present while using it and when I would open it to put a diaper in it the horrible stench would become even worse and would linger for hours
__label__neg	It is now sitting in our garage until we can give it away
__label__neg	only specified bags,  really messy and I see no point to doing this when you have a garbage can and hopefully you do not leave your garbage for a day or 2 in the house so when you take the garbage out,  you take the dirty diapers
__label__neu	Please,  I have it,  my daughter is 9mths old and ask me how many times have I used it
__label__neu	ask me
__label__neu	I'll tell you- NONE
__label__neg	Thank you to the gift bearer,  it was a great idea,  thought,  gesture and surely appreciated but the system sux
__label__neu	We bought this frog pod and put it in our little girl's bathroom
__label__neu	About 4 months later at 2 in the morning,  my husband and I were jolted by a loud crash
__label__neu	We looked all over the house looking for the source of the noise
__label__neg	It wasn't until the next morning that I realized that it was the frog pod that fell off the wall (the sticky tape stopped working I guess
__label__neg	This product is a piece of junk
__label__neg	Don't waste your money
__label__neu	I bought this from Babies R Us
__label__neu	I really really need divided travel plates with lids
__label__neu	I thought this would work
__label__neu	However,  some lids were hard to remove and others easily removed
__label__neg	The lids don't have a rubber grip or anything,  so I could tell one container might leak
__label__neg	The other container with the tight lid was so tight and did not have a thumb pull or bigger 'lipped' side to ull up on
__label__neg	I new I would end up turning it sideways to open and then spill when opened
__label__neg	Plus,  the sheer tought of keeping track of all the lids made me cringe
__label__neg	I am returning it because it's too expensive for so many headaches
__label__neu	I am STILL looking for a good alternate and might try the Tikes Turtle divider plate with lid instead
__label__neg	These bottles are the worst I've ever seen
__label__neg	My son could not get latched on correctly,  the nipples were too small,  and then when he drank from them it went down way to quickly
__label__neg	And why should a bottle be so complicated that you have to either hold it just right or screw the lid on just right,  not to tight you know
__label__neg	Who wants to mess with that in the middle of the night
__label__pos	We switched to the playtex natural latch and everything was much better
__label__pos	Yes you have  the bags,  but there is no leaking and no extra air
__label__neg	I only use these bottle with my pump and even then they are a pain in the butt,  because they don't want to stay screwed to the pump
__label__neu	ERRR
__label__neg	Very frustrating
__label__neu	I spent a lot of time looking for a diaper backpack before my 2nd child was born
__label__pos	I really liked the zip out diaper changing compartment and front organizational pocket
__label__pos	It's large enough that I don't have to carry a purse
__label__pos	Now that I've been using it I LOVE the fact that it can attach to a stroller or shopping cart with ease
__label__neg	But after only a few uses the mesh cup/bottle holders have torn
__label__neg	"There was also a loose string coming off the backpack when it arrived that caused a ""run"" immediately"
__label__neg	For the price I wasn't happy
__label__pos	Despite these two issues I still like and use the bag
__label__neu	I used these with the Evenflo glass bottles
__label__pos	They work great
__label__neu	Evenflo Classic 4 oz
__label__neu	Glass Nurser - 6-Pack
__label__neg	My wife bought a bunch because they were (for a time) the only BPA-free bottles she found (frankly didn't look that hard)They are decent bottles yes,  but there is this extra pair of pieces which you have to assemble
__label__neg	I don't see that they do anything for reducing swallowed air or anything else,  but they're fidgety and just extra pieces to clean
__label__neg	It might not sound so bad but it more than doubles the amount of work to fill a bottle,  and at 3 AM when you have a screaming baby,  you don't want to be diddling around with the extra pieces
__label__neg	BE WARNED - Replacement nipples are $7
__label__neg	50 a pair and they last only a month or two before they need to be replaced (The holes enlarge and let too much flow out) There are MUCH CHEAPER and simpler / better designed bottles out there - you just have to look
__label__neu	The sippy cups are another story entirely
__label__neg	They are a disaster
__label__pos	My son loooooves this - he could stare at it for hours and smile at it
__label__pos	Finally I could do stuff
__label__pos	Definitely worth the money
__label__neu	I finally had to break down and replace my 9yr old playpen (that has been used by 4 children
__label__pos	I was happy to find that Graco made a square playpen,  not only the smaller rectangular Pack N Play
__label__pos	It arrived today and my daughter loves the bugs and the soft playmat
__label__pos	I'm happy that it folds up for travel and storage
__label__neu	Amazon had the best price as well
__label__neu	Since these are used for only minutes and then tossed away ,  and never heatedto a dangerous level,  the baby is safe and colic etc
__label__neu	is reduced
__label__neu	Only glass bottles are safer but they do not reduce colic
__label__pos	so I choose theseUsed them on 2 healthy kids and loved them
__label__pos	This is one snazzy shopping cart cover
__label__neu	"One lady referred to it as a ""totally fabulous situation"" when she came up to us in the store and gestured to it"
__label__pos	This cart cover COVERS everything
__label__neu	Your baby will not touch anything on the actual cart
__label__pos	Any licking or chewing will happen to the cart cover only,  THANK GOODNESS
__label__pos	The pillow is nice,  helps stabilize littler babies,  protects bigger ones from having accidents with their faces hitting the front bars of the carts
__label__pos	And it is tethered to the cover,  so when baby thinks it would be funny to launch it out onto a nasty floor,  it doesn't work out as planned
__label__pos	There are also several little loopies that you can use linkadoos,  etc
__label__neu	to attach toys with
__label__neu	There is a little band you can slip a sippy cup in
__label__pos	And the back pockets are FANTASTIC
__label__neu	You can use that as a diaper bag
__label__pos	And you really can operate this thing with one hand
__label__neu	the zipper is a little tough so I don't use it,  but you just flop this thing in that cart,  insert baby,  do a few snaps with the straps and you are OFF
__label__pos	"It is just a very nice,  comfortable ""situation"" for your baby and for your piece of mind"
__label__pos	And it looks REALLY cool too
__label__pos	I highly recommend
__label__neg	I started out using the 1 oz cubes,  but had a problem with the lids always popping open
__label__neg	They also didn't stand in the trays very well
__label__neu	Because of that,  I was hesitant to purchase the 2 oz cubes,  but I gave them a try anyway
__label__pos	The lids on these are MUCH better because they're a little deeper
__label__neu	The same for the trays
__label__pos	They're great for storing baby food or any left over sauces that you might have from cooking
__label__pos	I also love the fact that they're BPA free so that I can freeze them as well as heat them
__label__neu	I bought this chair for my 5 month old to go out to dinner with
__label__pos	So far it has worked great and it is easy to use and carry with us
__label__pos	I would recommend it
__label__neg	This is the worst thing ever
__label__neg	It sticks for one week and then its down
__label__neg	I put in on my coffe table and end tables and they are all damage because of the tape
__label__neg	Don't buy it
__label__pos	We recently used this lap tray on a trip and we were pleased with the results
__label__neg	"It is soft so it does not create the ""flat"" surface that is ideal for coloring and balancing toys"
__label__neg	It is nice to use for snacks in the car but if not installed level the food does tend to roll into her lap
__label__pos	However,  with safety in mind this is the best solution when compared with the hard surface lap travel trays
__label__neg	I really do not care for these bottles
__label__neg	When pushing the air out of the bag,  you must do it straight for the liner can come off the bottle,  spilling milk everywhere
__label__neu	In my case,  it was prune juice and the baby's medicine
__label__neg	I have been much happier with Dr
__label__neu	Browns
__label__pos	My husband and I love this product and so does our little girl who's 9 weeks old
__label__pos	She loves looking at the animals and at herself in the mirror
__label__pos	If she tends to get fussy in her carseat,  we simply turn the music on and she usually stops fussing and eventually falls asleep
__label__neg	However,  in order to start the music,  we either have to turn it on before we start driving,  or the passenger has to do it (obviously inconvinient if there is only the driver in the car
__label__neu	Also,  the batteries didn't last as long as we would have liked,  but maybe that was because she loves it so much,  we always had to turn it on
__label__pos	D Overall,  I find this product great and would recommend it to others
__label__pos	"I had a hard time figuring out how to get my daughter comfortable and nurse when she was born,  until my husband came home with ""my brest friend nursing pillow"
__label__pos	It made nursing so much easier
__label__neu	My daughter is weaning herself now,  but she was able to use the pillow for a little over a year
__label__pos	This pillow worked for me,  despite the fact that when I started I was significantly overweight
__label__pos	As I lost the excess weight,  I was able to tighten the pillow into a secure fit
__label__pos	I love the fact that the pillow cover is removable,  so that you can wash it
__label__pos	I love the pocket to hold burp rags (or TV remotes
__label__neu	I bought this for my Quinny Zappy stroller because it doesn't have any accessories that come with it
__label__pos	It's great and I love it
__label__pos	Perfect if you don't have to collapse the stroller
__label__pos	When I do need to take it in the car I leave the buggy buddy in the trunk but it's great for using on daily walks around the city
__label__pos	I put my camera,  wristlet,  baby food,  and bottle of water and keys in there and there's still room left over
__label__pos	Highly recommend
__label__pos	Can easily fit on any stroller since it has velcro straps that are adjustable to most style of strollers
__label__pos	Must have if your stroller didn't come with cup holders
__label__neu	I have spilt soda a couple of times so if you have a drink that is in a can I would recommend drinking half of it before putting it in the holder
__label__neu	I put tissue at the bottom just in case and it does the job just fine
__label__pos	These can definitely be a life saver during the first 1-2 weeks when you don't want compression on the nipple and you want them to air dry
__label__pos	I have small breasts so I could wear them in any bra,  and I didn't have a huge leakage problem,  so I changed the foam twice a day
__label__neg	The only problem I had was that my skin broke out where the rubber rested against it
__label__neu	I think it got damp and wasn't allowed to breathe because it cleared up within 48 hours after I stopped using them
__label__neu	Bottom line
__label__pos	the relief was worth any minor inconvenience
__label__neg	This is a great stroller for 1 child but not for 2It was impossible for my 2 year old to sit or stand in the back with my 1 month old riding in the front which I thought was the entire point of this strollerIt is only a good buy if both of your children are old enough to ride in the seats only the infant carrier part is completely useless
__label__neu	This replaced our soft toy-type faucet cover
__label__neu	We don't use the bubble bath option
__label__neu	But the kids think it's great to rinse under the cascading water
__label__pos	No problem getting it to fit our faucet
__label__pos	This has been a terrific buy
__label__pos	It allows for a central place for bath toys,  and also allows for them to drain easily
__label__pos	I also very much like the little shelf -- it's perfect for storing a bottle or two of bath wash
__label__pos	It mounted easily and firmly
__label__neu	that thing is not going anywhere
__label__neu	The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is beause I wish it was bigger
__label__pos	This is easy to put on my often squirmy toddler son for breakfast so that we can now go to school with clean clothes
__label__pos	the pictures of cats and dogs make it even more appealing and it gets the job done,  is easy to clean,  etc
__label__neu	I had this chair sent to my parents house before a visit with our 6 month old baby thinking it will last a while longer than a regular bouncy seat since she doesn't visit there often
__label__pos	I loved this chair and if I had seen them earlier would have bought one for our house instead of a regular bouncy seat and may still get one when she outgrows the bouncy (it has a vibrating function like the bouncy which has always helped her take naps better
__label__pos	She really liked it and it was a saver as we used it for a feeding chair,  entertainment center with the toys and a napping seat
__label__pos	I love the fact that it can be used up to 40# so she can use it as a rocker for the next couple years
__label__neu	Had a little difficulty reclining or lifting the back with her in it as have to push both buttons at same time as moving the back but was not that big of an issue
__label__pos	Well worth the money
__label__neu	I bought one of these bottles because i likes the idea of being more like the breast,  and i wanted to breast feed
__label__neu	"I couldnt breastfeed but my son only really likes ""dome"" type nipples"
__label__neg	I tried giving him this bottle and he couldnt get anything out of it
__label__neg	He was just sucking air
__label__neg	I looked at the ammount in the bottle after a few minutes and he hadnt gotten anything
__label__neu	"I tried twisting the top of the nipple to ""open"" the hole and tried again"
__label__neg	he still had the same problem
__label__neu	I use the normal ventaire ones and he love them and has no problem
__label__neg	They sometimes leak and it's really difficult to heat the milk inside because the plastic is too tick
__label__neg	It takes forever to warm the milk which make baby really frustrated
__label__neu	Think of nightime feeding
__label__neg	I am not too impressed with this product
__label__neg	It was okay for the first week,  but then my son started to slide up or down and would not even be on it by the time he woke up,  which defeated the purpose
__label__neg	The sides do not attach very well to begin with and definitely are not helpful if the baby scoots during sleep
__label__neg	Another problem is with washing it
__label__neg	It is very hard to get the cover back on once you take it off
__label__neg	It is like it doesn't fit properly
__label__neu	My son is 5 weeks old and I stopped using this 3 1/2 weeks ago
__label__neg	Don't waste your money
__label__neg	It made my breasts look funny,  it made my nipples more irritable & it left painful marks on my breasts
__label__neg	Hardly ever used it
__label__neg	I was never fond of this even with the first use
__label__neg	The baby sling never stayed in place and i was constantly adjusting the sling and baby
__label__neg	When i moved to the bath ring it's plastic edges are sharp and usually scratched him while he moved around
__label__neg	It doesn't colapse or open easily leaving a large tub
__label__neu	The only time i was happy with it was once he was old enough to sit in the full tub which is when this isn't needed
__label__neg	I absolutely hate this pump
__label__neu	I went through 3 of these because I wasn't able to get my money back and could only exchange
__label__neg	The motor broke twice and one time it suctioned in and never released
__label__neg	Instead of exchanging it for a fourth time,  I just threw the whole thing out
__label__neg	The part that attaches to the motor/handle and the piece that allows milk through are impossible to clean
__label__neg	Eventually,  on all 3 that I went through,  the milk builds up in the piece that attaches to the bottle (only takes a few pumps to fill this up) and you have to break suction for it to filter through
__label__neu	It continues to do this for as long as you're pumping
__label__neg	If you don't realize that the milk hasn't gone through,  the built up milk gets into the motor/handle and leaks out through the suction power control
__label__neg	The massage bubbles on the cup are uncomfortable and only irritate your breasts
__label__neg	The suction dies down almost immediately making pumping take so much longer
__label__neg	This pump is such a waste of money
__label__neg	Buyer beware
__label__neg	I've read these bottles are made in England so I thought that the quality will be superior but how wrong I was
__label__neg	It started to leak after 2 months of use
__label__neg	I liked that bottle cuz it was pretty small and comfortable for my child to grip,  but leaking takes all good away
__label__neg	Be wise,  don't buy it
__label__neu	This is our first baby and I researched everything we even considered buying
__label__neu	I tend to take negative reviews with a grain of salt and was excited about this product
__label__neu	We just received this swing frame as a gift and I put it together right away and tried it out
__label__neu	We have a Graco Snugride carseat and my 7 week old baby is 11 lbs
__label__pos	This product folds up well for travel,  which is one of the main reasons we registered for it
__label__pos	The vibration (2 settings) and music/nature sounds work well
__label__pos	You can adjust the speed which is nice
__label__neg	The problem with it is the motor simply cannot keep up
__label__neg	You can hear and see the problem
__label__neg	The motor works hard to keep up and the swing would go faster at times then slow way down - which startled my sleeping baby
__label__neu	It actually kept a more consistent pace before I put the batteries in and just pushed the seat with my son in it
__label__neu	If Graco put a more appropriate sized motor in it,  I would definitely recommend this product
__label__neg	Until then,  mine is getting returned
__label__neg	As others have said,  these bottles leak
__label__neu	A lot
__label__neg	And the ones that Avent will offer to send you as replacements also leak
__label__neu	A lot
__label__neg	Buy a different brand
__label__neu	"I needed a gate for the top of the stairs,  and searched Amazon for ""baby gate top of stairs"
__label__neu	This gate is the second item returned
__label__neu	Nowhere in the description does it say that this gate should not be used at the top of the stairs
__label__neu	Of course as soon as we opened the box the instructions clearly say DO NOT USE AT THE TOP OF STAIRS
__label__neu	The gate works great in the upstairs hallway,  but we'll still need to buy a different gate at some point if we want the baby to have access to our room
__label__neu	I am not a fat woman,  but when I've just given birth to a baby,  I'm not a SKINNY woman,  either
__label__neu	Boppy Pillows are designed for SKINNY women
__label__neg	If you aren't super-skinny,  you will never get that pillow around your waist
__label__neu	If you are skinny,  I'm sure this is a great product
__label__pos	I did find my Boppy was useful for sitting my baby inside,  as he was learning to sit up
__label__pos	It supports them all around from falling
__label__neu	I ran out to buy this at the suggestion of the hospital's lactation consultant right after delivering our daughter in November
__label__neg	"She said it was a ""good little lightweight pump,  and affordable"" --- well,  I don't think [$$] for a manual plastic unit that hurts your wrist and breaks after 5 weeks of regular use should be considered ""good"
__label__neg	I was dismayed to find how tired I became while expressing my milk twice a day -- the pump is not comfortable at all
__label__neg	the rubber guard has become loose and doesn't adhere properly to the breast,  and the worst is that the neck has cracked on the pump causing milk to leak out
__label__neu	I just called AVENT customer service and they tried to tell me I was using the incorrect kind of WATER to wash the unit out
__label__neg	I suggested to them that they make a product that is durable so that moms don't have to waste precious time,  money and effort replacing parts that should have been made properly in the first place
__label__neg	SAVE YOUR MONEY -- DON'T BUY THIS ITEM
__label__neu	I don't have a whole lot to say about this booster,  but wanted to note to other buyers that there is a potential tipping hazard with the seat
__label__neu	We visited with friends for lunch one day and they pulled out this booster and attached it to a folding chair and brought it to the dining room table for us to use
__label__neu	I sat next to my 10 month old daughter the whole time but simply did not react fast enough when she leaned forward and tipped the entire apparatus (the high chair and the adult folding chair) forward
__label__neg	Since the chair was facing the dining table,  she ended up busting her lip right on the edge of the glass table
__label__neu	The booster with tray can be quite front heavy,  so please be sure you only attach it to a very sturdy and preferably wide chair
__label__neu	And insist on it if you're visiting others (we are often too polite for our own good
__label__neg	My daughter is not a very active or bouncy baby,  but she managed to tip it over while leaning forward
__label__neg	There aren't warnings to this effect on the booster seat,  but I wanted to make the issue known to other parents to whom it may not have occurred
__label__neu	SO we were taking a very long,  very boring car trip and I thought that having a mirror with lights and sounds would work wonders for our 4 month old
__label__neu	It would have been helpful if it had WORKED
__label__neg	We stop four times at different Walmarts along the way (where I purchased the first) and NONE of them worked
__label__neu	I talked to one lady who said that she had already had 3 returned that morning
__label__neg	Save yourself the hassle and buy a different mirror
__label__neu	Get a foamy bath tub thing
__label__neu	This worked for my son's first bath then he was too big for it
__label__neu	And he slides down it
__label__neg	Waste of space and money
__label__neu	This looked great on Amazon and I read the reviews before buying two of these SwaddleMe fleeces
__label__neu	If you have a wriggly baby,  or one that has strong limbs - then don't buy this product
__label__neu	My baby at 2 weeks was pushing his way free
__label__neg	I was also given a couple of other velcro type swaddles,  none of them worked
__label__neu	Finally I tried the Miracle Blanket
__label__neu	That is the ONLY swaddle that keeps a baby properly contained
__label__neu	We have only just stopped using it (baby is 4 months) because he has managed to work his fist out to suck and pacify himself each morning,  which I believe is a sign that he's ready to graduate to just a sleep sack
__label__neu	Just beware that these swaddles are expensive,  so go with one that you know will work whether you have a more passive baby or not - the Miracle Blanket
__label__neu	No buttons,  no velcro,  just well positioned inner flaps for the arms,  a pouch for the legs (which is separate from the arm flaps so you can change the diaper without undoing the entire swaddle) and then much longer flaps that wind around him and tuck in on the edge
__label__pos	They also do well in the washer/dryer
__label__neu	Hope this helps a bit
__label__neu	Well,  I thought it was an OK product at first
__label__pos	It does seal out the orders reasonably well
__label__neg	However I do not recommend it,  because after 6 month of use,  the rubber part  on top is coming off,  making it impossible to use
__label__neg	Since I have read about this problem in other reviews,  I do not believe its a fluke
__label__neu	Notice that most positive reviews are from people who have not had it very long
__label__neg	I will replace it with a stainless  steel trash can
__label__neg	Save your money,  do not buy this product,  because it will break after few months
__label__neu	The main ingredient in this is petroleum jelly which you can get for 99 cents at WalMart
__label__neu	Use Hydrocortisone 1% and it works wonderfully well for eczema
__label__pos	It's the only thing that helps me
__label__neg	The lid doesn't turn and the blue lip gets stuck
__label__neg	You have to wrestle with this with both hands while holding the bottom with your foot
__label__neg	And the wipes fall out all the time
__label__neg	It's just AWFUL
__label__neg	I love the design/look of this,  but we also had problems with soap leaking out
__label__neu	No real problem since we keep liquid soap in the bath anyway
__label__neg	The big problem was with it falling off
__label__neu	I contacted customer service and they were very helpful offering suggestions,  though they did not offer a refund since it had been several months since the purchase
__label__neu	We are still using it and it is pretty stable after I wrapped a few rubber bands around the faucet (under the Boon Flo) and one around the back
__label__neg	I do not mind this setup,  but find it disappointing to have to deal with it for a product at a higher price point
__label__neu	We are still using it more than 2 years after purchase though,  since it does work with the modifications
__label__neu	If I'd spent less initially,  I would have given it a higher rating even with the problems
__label__neg	"I do enjoy the ""waterfall"" effect,  though honestly I wish I'd just purchased a cheaper blowup/plastic cover to start"
__label__neu	i like to start of by saying cherry colour is not really cherry
__label__neg	sad but true,  it did not match my other davinci stuff that was also cherry
__label__neg	i am a little worried that the changing top will not be strong enough to hold a baby for long
__label__neu	its made out of partical board about 1/4 inch think
__label__neg	what if your little one happens to make a mess,  that board is going to turn to mush
__label__neg	the construction is very poor and it not really worth the money,  but to late now for me
__label__neu	I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talkinga bout
__label__neu	We registered for this set and got it as a gift
__label__neu	I have used NOTHING from it
__label__neg	The green suction bulb is so hard I can't possibly get it to compress with one hand - its useless for suctioning babies nose,  we used the one from the hospital
__label__neu	The same thing with the dropper
__label__neg	The tweezers were so hard to handle,  I just used mine
__label__neu	The brush and comb are okay
__label__neg	The nail clippers are too difficult to see what you are doing and so I end up cutting my daughter's fingers - the nail scissors are too dull to cut her nails
__label__neg	Overall,  this is a cheap set and I wouldn't recommend it
__label__neu	I bought this sheet because I believed everything should be &quot
__label__neu	form fitting&quot
__label__neu	if my son was to be in it - to prevent possible suffocation,  choking
__label__neg	This sheet was so rough I could not lay my baby on it
__label__neg	After washing 3-4 times with loads of fabric softener - no difference
__label__neg	I used it once and it's been in the closet ever since
__label__neu	I ended up putting a thin blanket in the packnplay and tucking it into the sides instead
__label__pos	It was soft,  and when my child was sleeping he didn't pull it out
__label__neu	If and when I use the pack and play as a playpen,  I may pull the sheet out and try again
__label__neg	For the basinett - don't bother
__label__neg	This swing does not recline,  so if your baby cannot completely sit up on their own,  they slump down or tip to the side
__label__neg	When they tip to the side,  the little hanging fish hit them in the face
__label__pos	There are also delightful little fish swimming on the sides of this device
__label__neg	When your child leans over to explore,  their little heads get stuck between the fixed post and the swinging arm and get banged over and over
__label__neu	The only nice,  safe feature is the lights
__label__neg	Do not buy this Swing
__label__neg	Buy something safer
__label__neu	I'm on my 3rd baby and have had 2 different models of this item
__label__neg	BOTH lids have broken,  and that is with light use
__label__neg	It also does pathetically little to keep the smell down
__label__neu	My current model is pretty much a paperweight in the corner of the nursery and we have been using grocery bags to dispose of the diapers
__label__neu	I just got the Munchkin Arm and Hammer diaper pail to evaluate before its release next month and I tossed my old Diaper Genie right in the trash
__label__neg	I figure it can't be any worse,  LOL
__label__neu	I received this tub as a gift at my baby shower
__label__neu	I looked at it and thought what a great idea for a tub
__label__neg	Wrong
__label__neg	First of all,  the tub leaks
__label__neg	You cannot let go of the baby for one second beacause they will slide
__label__neu	My son absolutely hated bath time until I bought the seat that sits in the bath tub and now he is happy
__label__neg	The sides of the ramp are hard and if they move there head to quickly they could hurt themselves
__label__neg	I wouldn't recommend this to anyone
__label__neu	I got this pump,  because my electric one was a little noisy and I didn't like waking up my daughter in the middle of the night
__label__pos	At first the pump worked great
__label__pos	getting rid of the engorgement and pumping out most of the milk
__label__neg	Then it started making slurping noises and the rings for suction started to not go on properly (I have never sterilized any parts in a sterilizer or anything else or placed any of the parts in a dishwasher,  so the reason for the parts not fitting right can't be because of them being warped or damaged in someway by me
__label__neu	Then,  my milk supply started to diminish,  due to the pumps inability to stimulate my breasts to keep producing,  but I guess this feature would be good if you wanted to stop breastfeeding and ease the engorgement
__label__neu	I had to switch to breastfeeding exclusively,  with no bottles,  to stimulate my milk supply back,  but now my daughter refuses to take a bottle what so ever
__label__neg	So now the pump just sits in it's little travel bag collecting dust,  what a waist of $50
__label__neu	00
__label__neg	I thought this would be a wonderful way to be nice to our baby with the warmer wipes but it seems like they feel good when I initially open the door and get the wipe but it seems like they are already cold again by the time I start using it on the baby
__label__neg	Also the bottom few wipes always seem to get dry and brown so we waste a few wipes with each refill
__label__neg	It's an OK product but if I wouldn't buy it again
__label__neg	I'm so annoyed with this product
__label__neg	It's been only less than 2 mos but the top of the rack can never be positioned stable
__label__neg	I am so annoyed that the height is never stabled
__label__neg	The top is always dropping down
__label__neu	I use a hairband to keep up the top part
__label__neg	It still doesn't work
__label__neu	I'm on Amazon now looking for a replacement
__label__neg	I don't understand why there is such high marks for this cheap,  flimsy product
__label__neg	I was not impressed with these storage bags
__label__neu	I prefer to use the other brands that offer ziplock type closure
__label__neg	This brand is harder to close,  more time consuming and wasteful (due to spilling
__label__neu	I bought this for my son to try and get him to sleep properly but he ended up finding ways to escape it
__label__neu	I tried this on him for three days but I would get up to find him slid out of it,  giving me his mischievious grin
__label__neu	Luckily I was able to return it and get back the money I wasted
__label__neg	I think it's useless
__label__neg	Babies are too smart for this
__label__neu	They will find ways out of it
__label__neu	"i got stuck once at a conference because I forgot my cones for my pump,  so i set out to create an ""emergency"" stock of cones for the pump and car"
__label__neu	I bought these connectors
__label__neu	I know there is a picture
__label__neu	maybe i didn't see it
__label__neu	maybe it wasn't there
__label__neu	maybe i am not that famililar with pump products
__label__neg	but I was SOOOO disappointed to find that these did not come with the yellow half circle things that make these connectors work with the shields
__label__neg	ugg
__label__neu	then,  i was at babies r us and those yellow things cost as much as a fully assembled cone,  so i just bought the fully assembled cones
__label__neg	i am disappionted this didn't come more complete for the price
__label__neu	My baby is 4 weeks old,  I have not yet used a thing from it
__label__neg	Regular adult stuff is more useful and better quality
__label__neg	I would actually give this fewer stars because we've gotten NO use out of it
__label__neu	but I think it's one of those personal preference things
__label__neg	My son just doesn't like it
__label__neu	We really thought he would - it's so soft and snugly
__label__neu	Thank goodness my mom also bought us the Fisher Price Soothing Massage Bouncer
__label__neu	He LOVES it
__label__neu	I think it's the massage feature that he likes so much
__label__neg	Wish I could give the papasan a better review - but my son gave it a thumbs down
__label__neu	These bottles were a gift at our baby shower
__label__neg	I am glad I didn't spend the money on them because the instructions warn not to use them in an electric bottle warmer
__label__neu	We all know you aren't supposed to microwave bottles either,  so you are left with the only other option,  placing the bottle in boiling water to warm
__label__neg	That works fine except when you tip the bottle up to feed the baby,  the boiling hot water that has been trapped in the vent holes drips down your hand/arm,  and potentially onto the baby
__label__neu	Now I have to remember every time to make sure I get a towel and shake the bottle a little to make sure all the vent holes are emptied out before feeding our baby
__label__neu	USE CAUTION
__label__neg	"While I haven't tried the ""new and improved"" Diaper Genie,  in reading the reviews it sounds like they haven't improved on the biggest issue,  which is setting the thing back up after you empty it"
__label__neg	"As someone else pointed out,  most of the time you end up with what my husband and I refer to as ""the giant poo-poo sack"" because no matter how many times you twist that first diaper,  the next one you put in just falls on top of it"
__label__neu	What I've had to do is lay the thing across my lap,  push in the second diaper with my right hand while my left hand is holding the first already twisted diaper in the bottom of the pale
__label__neg	It just shouldn't be all that complicated,  you know
__label__neg	I'm also really sick and tired of having to buy the refills
__label__neu	I think I'm going to get the Diaper Champ to keep downstairs where we do the majority of our changes and keep the Genie in the nursery
__label__neg	This Monitor can be described in one word-Horrible
__label__neg	My Husband and I would awaken in the middle of the night to this wretched static noise
__label__neu	Our baby slept through the night since day one
__label__neg	it was the monitor that kept us up
__label__neu	I finally gave up on it when she was 4 weeks old and got the sound and lights with dual receivers
__label__neu	it's been about 16 weeks since we got it and we have never had one problem with it
__label__neg	This monitor is not worth the money
__label__neu	This product does not fit all bath tubs
__label__neg	We have an oval tub and it did not come close to fitting it due to the crazy arm on it
__label__neg	There was no way to remove the arm and the seat does not have suction cups on the bottom so we had to return it
__label__neg	This was okay- I like that it's all one piece,  but my daughter didn't like it at all
__label__neu	We bought this item to use in our nursery
__label__pos	The sleep sheep arrived in what appeared to be great condition and was really cute
__label__neg	Unfortunately,  the screws used by the manufacturing company are so cheap,  we stripped them by lightly applying pressure with the screw driver
__label__neu	We were able to get one out,  but not the other
__label__neg	I can't comment on how the item works since we weren't able to gain access to the battery compartment
__label__neu	I bought this and set it up days before our daugther was born
__label__neu	I am glad I did because we instantly picked up the neighbor's baby who lives in the townhouse 3 doors down from us- imagine the confusion
__label__neg	Even changing stations didn't help- we still picked up the sounds from their monitor AND even more static
__label__neg	I followed all the directions to avoid other interferrances but none helped
__label__neg	"When you turn up the volumne,  even if the monitor and hand units are in separate rooms,  they will make a horrible sound as though they are still ""too close"",  so you have to turn down the volumne thus making it nearly impossible to hear the sounds of your baby- especially over all the static"
__label__neg	I read lots of reviews on all the monitors and thought this one would be the best for our money but this one is going back to the store ASAP
__label__neu	Have tried 3 different brands now and I liek these the least
__label__neu	My breast leakinsane amounts throughout the day so no matter what pad I wear I have to change it every hour or so
__label__neu	I have to wear 2-3 pads on each breast regardless
__label__neu	Totally crazy I know
__label__neg	These pads though when not soaked yet are like putting paper between my bra and breast so they're not comfortable at all and they crumple up a bit in places
__label__neu	The tape is pointless as they don't move around at all as did none of the others brands I tried
__label__neu	If you have a bra that fits a bra pad will stay in place
__label__neu	One other issue is and at the same time it's a positive I guess is that because these pads are kind of like a diaper in the sense of being absorbent and having that extra layer,  you don't always know until you happen to touch one of the pads that it's completely soaked through for who knows how long
__label__neu	It's very obvious when one is soaked as it weight a whole lot more and feels like a dead jellyfish,  but you only know this when you check it
__label__neg	I would not buy these again
__label__neg	I bought these because my sister who had a baby a couple of months before me recommended them,  but I was very dissapointed
__label__neg	my clothes would always get soaked if I left them on for more than 3 hours
__label__neu	I'm giving it 2 stars just because they worked well for my sister who does not leak as much as I do
__label__neg	This product seemed like it would work so well,  but in reality it is terrible
__label__neu	1) Lightweight diapers don't actually fall through hole
__label__neg	You have to poke them through
__label__neg	2) It is really loud when you close the lid
__label__neg	The clamps snap shut and are way too loud
__label__neg	3) Top heavy - it wants to fall over and has fallen over multiple times4) The lid does not want to latch half the time
__label__neg	&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;BUT if you still decide to get this, check it in the store first, because when I got mine home it was USED- it had obvisiously been returned (someone else thought it was useless too I guess) with milk residue on the bottles- yuck
__label__neg	These cups leak like crazy
__label__neg	 I took pictures of them leaking
__label__neg	 I will be uploading them into amazon's product picture page, we'll see if it's approved
__label__neg	 There is a hole at the base of the nozzle, right where it meets the colored plastic
__label__neg	 I don't know why the hole is there, but all of the cups have this design flaw
__label__neg	 Don't waste your money on these cups
__label__neg	 They are cute, but they leak and make a terrible mess
__label__pos	 I've tried gerber cups and those were a lot better
__label__neg	This is the Boppy Bounce in Comfort Bouncer, however, the description on Amazon is for the Boppy Cradle in Comfort Bouncer
__label__neg	 So, I didn't realise they weren't quite the same thing
__label__neg	I was just sent this package and had put together before I realised that the music/sound component wasn't what I wanted
__label__neg	 Aside from the ability to bounce and the softness of this device, the reason I wanted it was the soothing sounds
__label__neg	 However, this item only has one selector so all you get is the music
__label__neg	 Also, I assume that the music cycles through all 5 tunes that are mentioned on the package
__label__neg	 I didn't bother to listen as the first tune was just dire
__label__neg	Bottom line: If you like the idea of soothing sounds, don't buy this product
__label__neg	 I have returned mine and indicated to Amazon the incorrect descriptor on the website
__label__pos	Other than this issue, the product looked a good buy for the price
__label__neg	 The colour of the material was a bit ho hum but that wouldn't have caused me too much angst
__label__neg	 At least it was neutral which was what I wanted
__label__neg	This pump is NOT BPA-free
__label__neg	" Note the fine print: only ""parts that come into contact with breastmilk"" are BPA-free, which means the handle, the part YOU touch the most, has BPA, as I discovered from the little #7 plastic sign on the back"
__label__neg	This brings me to another point: I only uncovered the #7 sign when I was poking around wondering why my pump had lost suction after only a few months of occasional use (several other reviews here noted the same thing)
__label__neg	 I found a little tear in the clear plastic underside of the handle
__label__neg	 Very disappointed in the quality
__label__neg	Buyer BEWARE
__label__neg	I have this item and it would be great if it was BPA Free
__label__neg	" Take note, it says ""The machine has no traceable amounts of BPA"
__label__neg	""" does not mean ""BPA Free""This machine should be ""BPA Free"" it can't be that difficult to remanufacture"
__label__neg	SUSPECT
__label__pos	It worked for about a month - worked very well to
__label__pos	 We loved it
__label__neg	 Then the picture got all fuzzy
__label__neg	 We returned it to Safety first and they sent us the Prism
__label__neg	 We lvoed the prism till it got 'pin stripes' on the monitor
__label__neg	 Either we have the worlds worst luck with minotors or saftey first's quality is going down hill
__label__neg	We've been testing bottles with our newborn
__label__neg	 Born Free, Medela, Avent, Nuby, etc
__label__neg	This pricey little item is probably the worst bottle we've ever tried
__label__pos	 (Though our baby doesn't really complain about it)
__label__neg	 This is our list of issues:- The flow rate on the newborn nipple is the fastest of any bottle we've tried, it's not even close to a real breast
__label__neg	 When I turn it upside down, milk comes rapidly dripping out right away (no, nipple does not appear to be damaged)- It's a nice big nipple, but not really like a breast
__label__neg	 It's no better than the Nuby, with perhaps the Nuby being a bit better actually- The volume markings on the side of the bottle are near impossible to read
__label__neg	" Add to the fact that you have to fill it while in its ""sleeve"", which adds another translucent layer, you might as well forget about measuring out quantities"
__label__neg	- It is near impossible to warm up this thing
__label__neg	" You cannot warm it with the ""sleeve"" (well, you could, it'd take forever), but you cannot warm it nipple-down without the milk leaking out"
__label__neg	" You can't warm it nipple-up either, because the stupid ""petal valve"" at the other end will leak out the milk too"
__label__neg	Did the designers of this bottle ever try USING this thing to feed a real baby
__label__neg	I got Snuggli and Bjorn for my baby shower
__label__neg	 I was planning on returning Bjorn to get my big $$$ back
__label__neg	 But Snuggli was so difficult to use with all those straps and belts that my impatient baby had a fit every time
__label__pos	 Baby Bjorn worked better
__label__neg	Other than the flashy colors, this toy is a bummer
__label__neg	 My son has virtually ignored this toy since day 1
__label__neg	 Maybe he just doesn't get it
__label__neg	 But I'd skip this one
__label__neg	It's too small for standard contoured changing pad
__label__neg	 Plus, it shrinks in the wash
__label__neg	 It is also very poor construction, the stiching around the elastic that secures it was coming loose when I opened the package
__label__neg	 Needless to say, we returned it
__label__neg	Was just larger than he wanted in his mouth
__label__neg	 He liked the color, but never wanted to chew it really
__label__neg	 We tried quite alot to get him too, but in the end waste of money
__label__neg	 (but for us so were all the teething items, he never used a one, just wanted to chew on straps)
__label__neg	I had bought this for my son when he was a few months old
__label__neg	 We lived in an apartment complex on the second floor, so it was crazy to drag him and teh stroller down stairs
__label__neg	 I had bought this to make our daily walk to the mailboxes easy
__label__pos	 It worked great at first
__label__neg	 When he turned 4 months old I had problems
__label__neg	 I was packing the car to go on a trip with him in it
__label__neg	 IT was TOO tight around his stomach that he spit up in teh back of our SUV
__label__neg	 With him in it I couldn't even put two fingers between him and the carrier
__label__neg	 Never used it since
__label__neg	I just deleted my first review, which I made after owning this pillow for a month
__label__neg	 I originally gave it 4 stars, taking one off because it's bulky and makes it difficult to roll over
__label__neg	However, after owning it for 3 months, the top (where my head rests) was completely flat and I had to use a second pillow under my head
__label__neg	 It also ripped right on the inside of the curve where my shoulder hit it
__label__neg	 On top of all of that, you can't purchase covers for it, so I was stuck trying to deal with a standard pillow case cover over the top which just got tangled and fell off every night
__label__neg	I wish I would have just bought a new body pillow, it would have saved me a lot of money and headache dealing with this huge thing
__label__neg	I used this with kid#2
__label__neg	 Even as a newborn, he seemed too big(born at 7
__label__neg	12) He would slide all over even when held and even would slide down with his back ending up on the butt gap
__label__neg	 Then cause of the folding gap, water poured out with every movement he made, no matter how little water I put in it
__label__neg	 Also, the water level it holds(min
__label__neg	 or max
__label__neg	) was so low that his poor little parts were way above the waterline
__label__neg	 Boys tend not to like cold down there
__label__neg	 To be wet then above the water just didn't work
__label__neg	 I ended up using this hammock-on-a-frame type thing I got for #1 when she was little and bathed him in a regular tub
__label__pos	 Made it alot easier to wash his hair too since he was leaning back
__label__neg	 I would not recommend this one to anyone
__label__neg	 With the trouble and effort, you are better of cradling them in your arms over the tub
__label__neg	 same amount of support/lack of water/one handedness
__label__neg	This cover was kind of stiff and I didn't like it
__label__neg	 I'd prefer to use something softer so my daughter is comfortable playing
__label__neg	 I think I used them once and sold them
__label__neg	Unstable and flimsy, this piece of plastic nonsense is such a disappointment
__label__neg	 it's not sturdy enough to support a toddler
__label__neg	 I should have known that at this cheap price that I was going to get junk
__label__neg	 You're better off putting a stool on the ground and a seat on the toilet
__label__neg	Bottles don't wear out but nipples do
__label__neg	 They are also more prone to getting lost and going down the disposal
__label__neg	The cornerstone of Born Free's marketing campaign is that they are BPA free
__label__neg	 What many people overlook in their rush to buy BPA free bottles is that Born Free is hardly the only option (although they are probably the most visible)
__label__neg	 Note that BPA is only an issue with polycarbonate bottles, not with the nipples
__label__neg	They are almost certainly the most expensive
__label__neg	 This is particularly true if you price out the nipples, which are the only ones that fit their bottles
__label__neg	 For example, these cost THREE times as much as the Dr Browns replacement nipples
__label__neg	We have a bunch of the Born Free bottles and sippy cups
__label__neg	 Let's just say we're very unhappy because you don't just spend a lot on the original purchase, you spend a huge amount on replacement nipples
__label__neg	 These are nice nipples but they also seem to wear out much faster than other brands we used before
__label__pos	 At this price, it definitely pays to do your research
__label__neg	Got one as a gift and now have to return it
__label__neg	" It is not as ""universal"" as it states"
__label__neg	 The only way you can keep a Peg Perego Primo Viaggio car seat from completely falling off is to use a strap that it somes with
__label__neg	 The car seat does not lock onto anything, but merely rests on the bar
__label__neg	 The problem with having to strap the car seat down is that the strap goes OVER the baby's chubby legs and/or belly
__label__neg	 It doesn't leave much room for an infant once you secure the car seat to the stroller
__label__pos	The idea behind these bags is great - you can pump straight into the bag and store them
__label__neg	 The execution, however, is lousy
__label__neg	 Using twisties to seal the bags is cumbersome and annoying
__label__neg	I prefer the Lansinoh bags with the double seal
__label__neg	 Even though you can't pump straight into them, sealing them is quick and easy
__label__pos	We first bought the elite and we love it
__label__neg	 Thinking a second on another floor in the house would be a good idea, we grabbed this product
__label__neg	 The differences, for 10$, are pronounced
__label__neg	The first two differences are quite cosmetic: the genie is a few inches shorter and it does not have a foot pedal
__label__neg	 I didn't think this would be a huge issue
__label__neg	 Boy was I wrong
__label__neg	 This product forces you push the diapers through the opening
__label__neg	 Now this doesn't sound bad until you realize that the mechanism used to keep the smell in is very stiff and requires some pressure
__label__neg	 This really isn't the most hygienic method of diaper disposal
__label__neg	 In fact in really messy diaper and you'll most likely want to shift the bag down some
__label__pos	The rest of the product is ok
__label__pos	 Its quite easy to remove the diapers from the product
__label__pos	 The razor to cut the bags is fine
__label__pos	 The bag replacement system is well designed and easy to replace
__label__neg	 However the fact you need to push the diaper through the pail's opening makes this product near worthless
__label__neg	what they don't tell you is this
__label__neg	 Graco SafeSeats are compatible with this stroller, which are supposed to last around a year or up to 30 inches
__label__neg	 But, once your baby reaches 23 inches or so, her feet will be completely smooshed up against the seat in front (the seats overlap, and there is no room for feet under the overlap)
__label__neg	 My daughters are only 3
__label__neg	5 months old, and already I need to buy a new stroller, since the daughter in the rear can't be strapped in anymore or her feet will be pinched between the seats
__label__neg	So, while I love this stroller for its ease of use, its exceptional maneuverability, its light weight, and the fact it's the only double stroller that fits into my Prius, that it's only good for twins up to 23 possibly 24 inches is a major design flaw
__label__neg	 If it were only a little longer, I would give it 5 stars
__label__neg	Yes, I could have bought the smaller Snugride seats, but my babies would probably be outgrowing those around now as well so the same problem would exist
__label__neg	 If it says it's compatible with Safeseats, it should allow room for feet in the overlap
__label__neg	 & certainly last longer than 3
__label__neg	5 months
__label__neg	We used Avent bottles for several weeks, but our baby was spitting up _all the time_, seemed like she was choking during feedings, and had gas all the time
__label__neg	 We switched to the Playtex VentAire bottles when she was 6 weeks old, and problem solved
__label__neg	 No more crying from gas, she hardly ever spits up anymore, and she has a much easier time at feedings
__label__neg	 The flow is slower and it really does cut down on the amount of air she takes in during feedings
__label__neg	 So, I highly recommend trying something other than the Avent bottles for small infants
__label__neg	 Maybe later, when our baby is a bit older we'll pull out the Avent bottles again, but for now, we aren't using anything except Playtex VentAire
__label__neg	I bought this baby wipe warmer in hopes that it was compatible with german housing
__label__neg	 Well it wasnt
__label__neg	 I should have read more into it
__label__neg	 It basically just serves as a very expensive wipes holder
__label__neg	 I dont really know how well it warmes up as I haven't been able to use it
__label__neg	These diaper doublers are paper thin
__label__neg	 They absorb very little as they are 100% cotton
__label__neg	 I don't really see the point in this product
__label__neg	 It serves no purpose as a liner since its inefficiency to absorb (unlike microfiber), and cannot be used as a disposable/flushable liner
__label__neg	Also, these DO STAIN
__label__neg	It was given to us as a gift, and I am so sorry that money was wasted on this product
__label__neg	I received this as a gift
__label__neg	 I was registered for the baby bjorn
__label__neg	 Since it was a gift I decided to keep it
__label__neg	 I used it once
__label__neg	 It was horrible
__label__neg	 it was hot outside, but my 6 week old daughter was sweating in it
__label__neg	 It says it's breathable, but in 80 degree weather it was too hot
__label__neg	 Also it made my back sore
__label__neg	 Okay for quick trips, but if going out for several hours I suggest investing some money in an adjustable baby sling or pouch like Maya Wrap
__label__neg	 There's several brands out there
__label__neg	I am disappointed with the quality if this item
__label__neg	 I have two and they both looked old, faded and worn after the first wash
__label__neg	 Not happy
__label__neg	Waste of money and time in assembly
__label__neg	 This product is poorly constructed and screw holes are not even the right size for the included pieces
__label__neg	Do not bother with this item, try Ikea for a space saving solution that is of better quality
__label__neg	To be fair we didn't have this for long
__label__neg	 We tried the carrier on 16 month old (at that time) and it took to look to put on and immediately began to sag
__label__neg	 I wanted mainly for a sling, so that in public I could nurse without attracting to much attention, but it was too long and too much of a hassle to put it on so we returned it
__label__neg	 I have yet to fine one that will fit and still be a reasonable price
__label__neg	I bought this tub because i liked the idea of the shower part and roominess of this tub but unfortunately the shower part is useless, i broke within a couple uses and when it did work it was just not worth the extra money
__label__neg	 My suggestion is to buy the tub that looks like this with out the shower part
__label__pos	Good Luck
__label__neg	I just don't like this product
__label__neg	 Basically it is boiling the water and the bottom of the bottle gets really hot and if you use the Vent Air bottle the water drips out of the bottom is it is really hot
__label__neg	 I just started using the mircrowave and it seem to heat faster this way
__label__neg	 It takes forever for the formula to get warm by this product
__label__neg	My daughter liked the nipple but got to much air
__label__neg	 I tried these and the Dr
__label__neg	 Brown but ended up going back to Playtex Nursers(I used these with all my other kids) I wouldnt recommend these
__label__neg	DO NOT BUY THESE BLOCKS
__label__neg	 A warning was issued in 2007 due to high amounts of lead in the blue block
__label__neg	 Supposedly, if you already owned the set you could send in your blue block for a replacement
__label__neg	 Every state has different laws regarding safety warnings, and unfortunately in NY state the stores do not have to remove items like this from the shelf unless it is officially recalled
__label__neg	 I still see them sold in older packaging at drugstores and at Target
__label__neg	 How pathetic is that
__label__neg	 Your child will most probably be putting these in their mouth
__label__neg	After using Avent (wide nipple) and Dr
__label__neg	 Brown's (standard nipple), I found that Dr
__label__pos	 Brown's smaller nipple was much better for my baby's tiny mouth
__label__neg	 As much as I love Avent bottle's anti-gas design, the nipple was too wide at the base and milk would squirt out of the corner of my baby's mouth constantly
__label__neg	 I switched to Dr
__label__neg	 Brown's standard nipple which worked great, but I hated washing all those parts
__label__neg	 I decided to try this one since the previous reviews rave about decrease in the dribbling of milk, however, this did not work for me
__label__neg	 My baby was even messier with this nipple, making loud smacking noises while she sucked and having a constant stream of milk going down her chin, making a mess everywhere
__label__neg	I really wanted to like these because they are cute bottles, but they did not work for my baby
__label__pos	I first thought these were so adorable
__label__neg	 They don't squirt well at all
__label__neg	 The material is too hard to squeeze out the water
__label__neg	 The water that's stuck in the toy builds up mildew and you don't want that floating in your baby's bath water or even let your baby put in his mouth
__label__neg	 I think it's meant for playpen playtime not bath time
__label__neg	 I say don't waste your money
__label__pos	 Get the cute little squirt duckies instead
__label__neg	 and I did
__label__neg	I bought this despite hearing that it is too hard, and now I wish I would have listened
__label__neg	 I am in the last half of my 2nd trimester, so maybe I'll use it more later, but for now it works best for back support when I'm sitting on the couch
__label__neg	 When I have used it for sleeping I wake up with a sore abdomen, because the wedge is hard
__label__neu	 I also have a snoogle pillow, and find that it works better alone, instead combined with the wedge
__label__neg	 I hope the manufacturer will improve upon this wedge by making it with a material more like memory foam, which would make it softer, but still supportive
__label__neg	" I am only 5'2"", with a very short abdomen, so maybe the wedge made me sore because it went under my ribs, which were the most tender when I woke up"
__label__neg	I thought my baby would be mesmerized and fascinated by the lighted musical waterfall
__label__neg	 but I think she's rather intimidated by it and all the stimulation
__label__neg	 The waterfall is not as cool as I expected and the music or sounds weren't all that impressive
__label__neg	 The hanging toys which are made of hard plastic, indeed hang too low so every time she moves her legs her knees activate it, which seems to agitate her
__label__neg	 The seat is pretty and uses good fabric but overall this item is not really worth paying its price
__label__neg	I wish I had just bought a used or cheaper bouncer
__label__pos	I really liked the diaper genie at first
__label__pos	 It is easy to use and def
__label__pos	 hides odors
__label__neg	 However, now that my son is in size 3 diapers it gets fulls so fast
__label__neg	 I have to empty it every other day and it now goes through the refills really fast
__label__neg	 I have stopped using it and am looking for another diaper pail system
__label__neg	I bought this hoping I could get the best of both worlds: a great toy for my son to look at and a mirror that would let me see him when I am driving
__label__pos	 Well, the first part was right, it's a cute frog
__label__neg	 Problem is the mirror is flimsy and really not of good quality
__label__neg	 It's distorted and really cheaply made
__label__pos	 Buy the Eddie Bauer mirror, it's a better buy
__label__neg	I was just about to buy this for my 3 month old when I noted a warning label-it stated that this toy is not intended for children under 3 years of age
__label__pos	 Generally I LOVE the manhatten toy company
__label__neg	but, I don't know why they would create a book that is obviously for a baby but allow for a possible choking hazard
__label__neg	So, be forwarned about it
__label__neg	 I do appreciate that the warning label is listed for this product; however, it would be very easy for someone to not see the warning since you have to scroll down to see it
__label__neg	Next time I suggest it being near the price of the product
__label__neg	My son is breast fed, but we have given him an occasional bottle
__label__neg	 He refused these
__label__pos	 I got them because of all the great things I heard about them
__label__neg	 I thought it would be easier for him to switch back and forth
__label__neg	 No chance
__label__neg	 He hates them
__label__neg	 He hate the Playtex disposables too
__label__neg	 He now takes Gerber bottles, traditional and New Traditions
__label__neg	My son hates this
__label__neg	 It's too hard for him to get the milk out of the bottle
__label__neg	 He doesn't even try anymore
__label__neg	I breastfeed him also and trust me
__label__neg	it's more work to get the milk out of this bottle than it is to get it out of my breast
__label__neg	In my opinion, this is in NO way similar to breastfeeding
__label__neg	I do NOT recommend
__label__neg	I absolutely HATE this Diaper Genie
__label__neg	 I don't know why everyone says this one has no smell, I have both models (this and the Twistaway) and I MUCH prefer the original Twistaway
__label__neg	 This one literally STINKS
__label__neg	 It's awful
__label__neg	 It smells SO much worse
__label__neg	 If I have just one poopy diaper in there, you can not only smell it when you open the lid to put in a new dirty diaper, but you can still smell it after the lid is closed again
__label__neg	 And I don't know how many times I have scraped my fingers on the inside trying to push the dirty diapers into the diaper genie
__label__neg	" With the Twistaway Diaper Genie, each diaper is ""twisted"" individually into the bag, sealing in the smell"
__label__neg	 Also with the original Twistaway, the refills are lightly scented, with this model you get nothing
__label__neg	 Nothing but lingering poopy stink
__label__neg	 I'm ordering another Twistaway and giving this model to Goodwill
__label__neg	My daughter is 3 months and weighs about 14 punds
__label__neg	 But she is tall and thin
__label__neg	 She is too small for it and doesnt like to slumped over
__label__neg	 Maybe it will work better when she has head control
__label__neg	This cup's straw assembly includes a BPA part, so it wouldn't be legal in Canada
__label__neg	 I have no idea why it's in Amazon's BPA-free store
__label__neg	Also, I bought one of these for my son before I knew Nuby's abysmal BPA record and campaign of misinformation to consumers
__label__neg	 I noticed that my son always chewed the straw (the silicone part, not the BPA part which is inside)
__label__neg	 One day I took a drink of his juice and it turns out you have to bite the straw to get liquid out
__label__neg	Also, when the child has taken a drink and snapped the lid closed, the straw, upon reopening, will shoot a notable amount of beverage toward and above the opener
__label__neg	I threw ours out
__label__neg	So far this isn't useful to me
__label__neg	 I went out and bought a sponge thing for my son to sit on
__label__neg	 He is 2 1/2 months old right now and when we first used it he didn't like it because he wasn't in the water
__label__neg	 You fill the tub up and they still sit out of the water
__label__neg	 Also, do not let the hose hang down when getting the water prepared because you will come back to it and find a big wet puddle on your floor
__label__neg	 For some reason it leaks out of the spary part
__label__neg	 But so far this hasn't been useful but the bath does seem like a good idea
__label__neg	 So we will see how it works for us in the future
__label__neg	I used this tub for the first 6 months of my son's life, and I never really liked it
__label__neg	 It was OK when he was a little baby and could fit in the sling part, but the pillow would get very cold very fast, and keeping him warm while trying to bathe him at the same time was a challenge
__label__neg	When I took the sling out, the tub became a HUGE pain-in-the-butt
__label__neg	 The seat area was almost too small for him, so he was always uncomfortable
__label__neg	 Plus, he wasn't yet sitting up on his own, but laying back would make the tub tip backwards
__label__neg	even with water in it
__label__neg	 What aggravated me the most though, was just how hard it was to get ALL the soap off his body
__label__neg	 The water in the tub becomes soapy as you rinse him off, so unless you have a detachable shower head (which I do not) then there's soap on him when you pull him out
__label__neg	I only used this tub maybe twice after removing the sling
__label__neg	 At about 6 1/2 months, I ditched it and bought a bath chair
__label__pos	MUCH better
__label__neg	 Overall, this was just OK as an infant tub, but no good for bigger babies
__label__neg	 I do not recommend
__label__neg	Both the fisher-price laugh 'n learn jumperoo and the fisher-price precious planet jumperoo were at the store
__label__neg	 At first I looked at the precious planet one since that seems to be the most popular
__label__neg	 But I was dissappointed that the palm leaves hung down so far
__label__neg	 Also, it didn't have a mirror or the little book that the laugh 'n learn barnyard animal one did
__label__pos	 Both are jumpers which I know any kid would love
__label__pos	 However, I really like the laugh 'n learn because it had more activities
__label__neg	My son is 7 weeks old and already over 13 pounds
__label__neg	 The Bjorn is uncomfortable for me after about an hour of wearing him in it - all his weight is carried by my shoulders and the so-called lumbar support really doesn't do too much
__label__neg	 Also, I have read it is not great to carry an infant hanging by his/her crotch with the feet dangling
__label__neu	I got an Ergo Baby Carrier instead and I love it so much more - it doesn't allow the babies to look out like in the Bjorn, but my baby doesn't mind, and the Ergo can be worn on my back when my baby can hold his head up better
__label__pos	 In the Ergo, his weight is distributed on my hips mostly and it makes him feel so much lighter than when he is in the Bjorn
__label__pos	Plus, it fits my 6'5 husband and the Bjorn does not
__label__neg	 I am going to sell my Bjorn
__label__neg	Whoever came up with this design must have been an idiot
__label__neg	 There is a reason umbrellas and most sun shades don't curve upwards -- the reason is that you don't want to get hit by the sun or rain when you are facing it
__label__neg	 This one appears to want to re-invent the wheel and of course fails miserably: when the baby is facing the sun this shade does not do anything to cover his/her face
__label__neg	 What a waste
__label__neg	As an ophthalmologist, I can attest to the functional utility of this product
__label__neg	 Newborns truly are drawn to high contrast patterns--but this product is so poorly made I would not recommend it
__label__neg	 The plastic cards are badly made--3 of them were broken straight out of the box such that I had to use tape to put them back together
__label__neg	 In addition, the holes in the card to attach to the main apparatus are inconsistent so that some fit too loosely and are easily knocked off while others are so tight I can't get them attached
__label__neg	 If motivated, you could probably make your own sturdier mobile--the patterns are available online
__label__neg	We got one of these when our son was a newborn in part to avoid interference with some 2
__label__neg	4 GHz devices around the house
__label__neg	 It worked reasonably well until just out of warranty, when the parent unit broke (the switch, apparently)
__label__neg	 We couldn't return it, and couldn't repair it
__label__neg	 Stuck with a child unit, and figuring it was just one of those things, we decided to buy a replacement pair, and just have an extra child unit we could swap in and out as a replacement
__label__neg	 Gosh, what do you know, the new child unit broke down, and we had only one parent and child unit, and then the second child unit broke down
__label__neg	We didn't drop, wet, or otherwise abuse any of these units, and followed the recharge and usage instructions to a T
__label__neg	Whatever the reason for the breakages, and however much the features may appeal, I don't think 12 months of combined use for two units is what you would call reliable
__label__neg	 In fact, I call it awful
__label__neg	 Avoid at all costs
__label__neg	I got this as a shower gift and returned it
__label__neg	 My little girl hated it
__label__neg	 She screamed when I put her in it
__label__neg	 I think it squeezed her
__label__neg	 It was really hard to get on and off and not comfortable for her or for me
__label__neg	 Her head was right in front of my chin too
__label__neg	 Even if she had liked it, I would have worried that I would hurt her head with my chin
__label__neg	 I don't think this carrier works well for short women with big babies (she was 8lbs
__label__neg	 at birth and we tried it then
__label__neg	)
__label__pos	I must admit, this is the third one of these swings that we have had
__label__neg	 The first two did not function properly, they would not swing side to side
__label__pos	but the third one was a charm
__label__pos	 My daughter loves this swing
__label__pos	 The seat is very soft and padded well
__label__neg	 The headrest is a must
__label__pos	 At first she did not care about the light show at all, but now that she is three months she loves the light show and the butterflies, they make her smile
__label__pos	 The only reason I get ANY sleep at night is due to this swing
__label__pos	 I just keep it on side to side with the lowest setting and she can sleep up to eight hours without making a sound
__label__pos	 The music choices are nice, and the natures sounds are great
__label__pos	 I would recommend this swing to anyone
__label__neg	 I would also recommend getting through (
__label__pos	) because their price is the best, and they are really nice if you need to return a defected item
__label__neg	 Hope this helps you decide
__label__pos	I was very excited to get this sling
__label__pos	 I love that most people don't realize I'm holding a baby when wearing it -- this makes nursing even more discreet than in a normal sling as you don't draw attention from people wanting to see the baby
__label__pos	 The outside zipper pockets are great for keys, cell, wallet, etc
__label__pos	, and the style is great (it looks more like a messenger bag until you're close up) & I've recieved lots of complements
__label__neg	 My 2 mo
__label__pos	 old dd is very comfortable sitting in it
__label__neg	That said, I would not buy it again
__label__neg	 My daughter hated it as a newborn & would immediately scream if I put her in
__label__neg	 The drawcord needs to be knotted to avoid danger of strangulation (very unsafe, not to mention inconvenient for adjusting)
__label__neg	 The sling is uncomfortably narrow at the shoulder & doesn't distribute weight well
__label__neg	I bought these because I wanted very badly to breastfeed my daughter but we were having latch-on problems
__label__pos	 I was told that nipple shields could be helpful for this
__label__neg	I went with the Avent because overall, I am super impressed with their products
__label__neg	 I only use their bottles and pacifiers and have been a happy customer in the past
__label__neg	I don't really recommend these specific nipple shields
__label__neg	 I can't get them to stay in place and they are really akward
__label__neg	 My daughter dislikes using them and I can't get her to nurse with these
__label__neg	If you are in the market for a nipple shield, go with the Medela brand ones
__label__neg	 Those are much easier to use and less akward for baby
__label__neg	I don't know if I like these or not
__label__neg	 I have several and have been using them since my son was born four months ago
__label__neg	The formula doesn't come out the way all of the books say it's supposed to, about a drop per second
__label__neg	 Actually, nothing comes out unless you milk the nipple, or more obviously, if the baby is sucking on it
__label__neg	 I did try using the second stage nipple and the formula comes out far to fast and my son won't have anything to do with it at this point
__label__neg	perhaps when he's older he can handle the rate of flow for the stage 2 nipple
__label__neg	One of the design flaws is the round silicone insert that eliminates the air in the bottle
__label__neg	 If you don't put it in properly after washing, the formula will leak from the bottom of the bottle
__label__neg	 It also seems that when it is in correctly, occasionally it creates some sort of seal or pressure, and the formula won't come out of the bottle at all
__label__pos	I still use them because I have them, and they do serve their purpose
__label__neg	 However, if I had the opportunity to buy new bottles, I would definitely go with Dr
__label__neg	 Brown's instead
__label__pos	I bought this carrier before my son was born and it worked great for almost two months
__label__pos	 I liked that he could face forward but
__label__neg	 he put on weight very fast and wearing the baby bjorn was simply unbearable
__label__neg	 I then bought the Ergo carrier and my son and I are comfortable and happy and we can continue to comfortably use it until he is 50 lbs (not that I will
__label__neu	lol
__label__neg	) I would not recommend buying this somehow very popular product because there is no telling how long you will be able to use it and it is very hard on the lower back
__label__neg	This bumper has not even been used since it never was able to hold in air due to it being defective
__label__neg	Sadly it arrived right before the holidays and we only had 15 days for returns
__label__neg	 Returns during the busiest week of the year
__label__neg	 YEAH RIGHT
__label__neg	 Next time I will make sure I have a 30 day return (at least that) before I make another purchase
__label__neg	They leak like mad
__label__pos	 and although you tell yourself you must be doing something wrong because no bottle should leak this much, it's not your fault
__label__neg	 It's these idiotic bottles
__label__neg	 I can't imagine how they passed any kind of testing when they were being made
__label__neg	 Please don't buy them, it is a huge waste of money
__label__neg	For some reason my baby cannot figure this cup out
__label__neg	 He is 10 months old and this cup just does not agree with him
__label__neg	I bought this for my almost 2 year old after reading the rave reviews
__label__neg	 It's pretty disappointing
__label__neg	 It doesn't do anything but float
__label__neg	 The blue spray nozzle doesn't really work
__label__neg	 You're supposed to squeeze it and it acts like a squeeze toy and is SUPPOSED to make the water run
__label__neg	 Instead you get a airy spray of water
__label__neg	 The only thing my daughter really seems to like about it is the orange cup that has holes on the bottom
__label__pos	 She likes to scoop up water in it and watch it trickle out from the bottom
__label__neg	 It's an okay toy I guess, but don't expect anything spectacular
__label__neg	These don't work that great at keeping our kids poop smells at bay in the trash
__label__neg	 I found that using a 13 gallon trash bag twisted around the diaper and then turned inside-out and twisted again then tied worked far better
__label__pos	 You can get almost just as many uses from a pack of 75 13gal trash bags and they are so much cheaper (about $2)
__label__neg	 I say this because I had to double bag the sassy bags to actually control the smells
__label__neg	 I'm no longer using these because I've switched to cloth diapers
__label__neg	Another bad thing is they aren't biodegradable, maybe they should change that
__label__neg	"pros - easy to clean- works like a straw as you only have to suck to get the air out and as soon as the air comes out the milk comes up so the bottle works at every angleCONS -The liners break when you try to ""burp"" them to get all the air out"
__label__neg	would rather take the time to burp baby then the bottle
__label__neg	- measurements are WAY off (8 oz bottles will NOT hold 8 oz)- extremely hard to read the off measurements when baby has drank a couple ounces
__label__neg	 i would ahve to pour the leftover formula into a regular bottle to see how much he ate which was bad when i thought he wasnt eating enough
__label__neg	- my kids had more gas with these
__label__neg	- leak all over everything if baby tips the bottle over on its side if he tips it upside down FORGET ANY CHANCE THAT IT MIGHT NOT LEAK
__label__pos	This was a great diaper bag
__label__neu	except that the routine my husband and I developed was that I always ended up carrying the baby and he always carried the diaper
__label__neu	I used these through out my daughter's infancy, largely because I bought a whole set of them, the milk storage contraptions, the breast pump, and the pacifiers
__label__neu	 Plus once she was used to the pacifiers and nipples she wouldn't take any other kind
__label__neg	But the bottles routinely leaked, ruining several diaper bags, clothing, and nighttime feedings
__label__neg	Apparently you have to screw the cap on just right- which is really difficult at 3 AM
__label__neu	My daughter didn't seem to have the gas and colic that other reviews talk about, but we did use quite a bit of gas medicine between 3 and 6 months
__label__pos	All in All, I think the paci's are great, the rest of it I could do without
__label__pos	Received this dresser as a gift for our baby's nursery and I spent a couple of hours putting it together myself (not too bad considering I'm 8 months pregnant)
__label__pos	 The directions were clear and the dresser is sturdy enough to work well for clothing and baby blankets
__label__neg	One major negative to me is the depth of the drawers
__label__neu	 They are only a little over half as deep as the drawer fronts are tall
__label__neu	 Why not make them a couple of inches deeper so they can hold more
__label__neg	 Doesn't make sense, even as a way to cut costs
__label__pos	Overall the dresser is decent for how much it costs
__label__neu	 We couldn't afford a high quality dresser this time around, and this dresser should do just fine
__label__neu	 We'll see how well it lasts over the next couple of years
__label__neg	UPDATE, 1/2014: I would not recommend this dresser
__label__neg	 It's so cheaply made, especially for the price
__label__neg	 The veneer is peeling off in 2 spots and the surface scratches incredibly easy
__label__neg	 There are marks around all of the handles caused from fingernails, and not just the fingernails of adults
__label__neg	 I am constantly having to tighten the screws on the handles the handles, we've almost lost a few
__label__neg	 I'm on the hunt for a new dresser because this one is about to fall apart
__label__neg	Don't bother buying these if you want your baby to take in less air
__label__neu	 Go with the Dr
__label__neu	 Brown's
__label__neg	 My kids actually ingested more air b/c of the nipple shape - they just couldn't get their mouths around the large base
__label__pos	Reasons I give 2 stars:-well-made-easy to clean
__label__neg	At first I really liked these, until I realized that my baby just used about 100 liners in about 1 week
__label__neg	 It's not easy to squeeze the air out
__label__neg	 Since I keep track of how much our baby eats, how can I do that when the liner is all scrunched up
__label__neg	 Not worth the money on the liners and there is plenty of air that gets into the liner even if once in a while you do manage to get the air out
__label__neg	 I'm sorry I ever bought them
__label__neg	I have this product on my baby registry and was disappointed to see that they price inflated by $10 overnight
__label__neu	 I hope that doesn't happen again
__label__pos	 One reason I chose this brand/model is for its price
__label__neu	I had NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO idea
__label__neg	 I only recieved this pump - no electrical one and I wanted 2 diiiiie
__label__neu	 I was in pain for days after I gave birth,irritable because of the lost of sleep and trying to conform to the babies temporary sleeping pattern
__label__neu	 I had a low milk supply and breastpumping for 1 hour for only 4ounces - this was not a joke
__label__neu	 I wanted 2 diiiie I tell you
__label__neu	 I would finish pumping and da baby would be getting up for a feeding
__label__neu	 NOooooo
__label__neu	 already, I would think
__label__neu	 yes and with only 4 oz to show
__label__neg	 Here I go with the stupid MANUEL pump
__label__neu	 NO
__label__neu	 I NOW know better
__label__pos	 electronic and a good brand- so what you pay 300
__label__neu	 and change its worth your sanity, sleep, time, energy and appreciation for the bond with the baby
__label__neg	 My milk supply in time grew (not soon enough) I am still nursing and again the manuel pump and I did NOT have a good relationship
__label__neg	 We started off badly
__label__neu	My husband and I originally tried the Avent bottles after several recommendations from previous users and after doing some research on our own
__label__neu	 However, we switched to Dr
__label__neu	 Brown's when our son began suffering from gas and nipple confusion, since I am nursing
__label__neu	 We can't express how much we LOVE the Dr
__label__neu	 Brown's bottles
__label__neu	 Our son's gas IMMEDIATELY disappeared and he no longer suffered from nipple confusion
__label__neg	 The Avent nipples are TOO HARD for a breastfed baby
__label__neu	 Dr
__label__neu	 Brown's bottles are the BEST BOTTLES ON THE MARKET
__label__neg	 Pass on these
__label__neg	don't believe the hoopla
__label__neu	My 13 month old immediately pulled off the covers and started playing with them
__label__neg	 She loved them and thought they were a cool new toy but they did not do the intended job
__label__neu	 They pull off very easily even though they were a perfect fit on the rail
__label__neg	Like digital television, this is a digital technology that leaves a lot to be desired
__label__neu	As long as you find the right spot to place this monitor, it will work just fine, although it's not sensitive enough to detect breathing
__label__neg	 The volume seems to be far too low in my opinion, although the static sure is loud
__label__neg	 If you attempt to move about with the reciever it crackles with static, beeps that it's lost the signal, and generally makes such a ruckus that it's better for waking the baby than monitoring her
__label__neu	And that's just if you're in the next room
__label__neg	 Attempt to move a couple rooms away, or to the outdoors, and you'll spend more time trying to find the signal for the monitor than getting a much-needed break while baby sleeps
__label__neg	I'd skip this one
__label__pos	 A shame, the docking station was a neat feature
__label__neg	This pump is NOT efficient in multiple daily pumpings
__label__neg	 There are many things wrong with this pump and I hardly know where to begin
__label__neg	 First of all, the instructions are not user friendly
__label__neg	 Like other Avent products, the manual relies on pictures that can be difficult to interpret
__label__neg	 Once assembled, I found that the pump leaked as a result of the suction petals not attached completely and totally
__label__neg	 During the process of pumping, the valve that creates the suction would become loose and I would have to unscrew the bottle and press it back into place
__label__neg	 The pump squeaked sometimes and I couldn't quite figure out why
__label__neg	 The instructions recommended changing the position of the petals on the breast to get the most milk, however, during this process it would leak even more because the milk would collect between the plastic and the suction petals when the milk was supposed to be going into the bottle
__label__pos	 I also purchased the sterilizer which works great
__label__neu	 However, the instructions insist on sterilizing the pump after each use
__label__neg	 Frankly, there are just too many parts that have to be assembled and taken apart
__label__neg	 I didn't think there was a need to have sooo many parts
__label__neg	 Overall, this pump was very messy
__label__neg	 For a manual pump, it was more complicated than it really had to be
__label__neg	 And for all the reasons listed above, I find this pump to be overpriced and not worth buying
__label__neu	My son was having a hard time sleeping when we brought him home from the hospital
__label__neu	 We call the nursery @ the hospital & asked them why
__label__neu	 They told us to have him sleep w/ us
__label__neu	 We did & it worked
__label__neu	 He got some sleep but I didn't
__label__neu	 I felt it was too dangerous
__label__neu	 So my husband foud this Snuggle Nest & bought it
__label__neg	 It took up so much space in the bed, it was also very hard & very dangerous
__label__neg	 Suffication waiting to happen
__label__neg	 My son hated it
__label__neg	 He would rather sleep alone than sleep in this thing
__label__neu	 We returned it
__label__neu	 It is also VERY HOT
__label__neg	 Everytime he slept in it he woke up soaked in sweat
__label__neu	 Save your money
__label__neu	 Put your baby in the crib or bassinet those are the only safe places for him/her
__label__neg	This gate does not keep enough pressure to stay in place, my toddler can knock it right over w/ little effort
__label__neg	I used this once when my baby was about a month old and the carrier was really tight under his armpits
__label__neg	 His arms were forced upward, looking like a bird trying to fly
__label__neu	 So I tried it again when he was 4 1/2 months
__label__neg	 Now the openings for his legs are not big enough (facing away from me
__label__neu	like the bigger babies are supposed to sit in it)
__label__neg	 His legs looked like they were losing circulation, so I had to take him out
__label__neg	 This product was not thoughtfully made in my opinion
__label__neg	 Not to mention, the clasps that open and close so you can put the child in are not easy to use
__label__neg	 I wish I'd bought something else
__label__neu	Before using to warm actual food or milk for my son I tested it out
__label__neg	 In the recommended time it was hot enough to leave blisters on my wrist when I tested it
__label__neu	Munchkin makes two versions of this cart
__label__neu	 This one and a deluxe version
__label__pos	 I bought the deluxe first for my changing area and its been great
__label__pos	 Only took me a few minutes to put together and has held up well
__label__neu	 I needed a temporary place to store some of my older son's clothing so I went to buy another
__label__neu	 I couldn't really tell the difference between the two versions at the store
__label__neu	 From the picture it just looks like this one is missing the diaper holder
__label__neu	 So I bought it to save $10
__label__neg	 Boy am I sorry
__label__neg	 This one is terrible to put together
__label__neg	 It took me 45 minutes of frustration and power tools before I gave up and let my husband finish it
__label__neu	 And I am pretty handy with these things
__label__pos	 It's just okay now that it's assembled
__label__neu	 It holds the clothes and when his room remodel is finished I'll probably toss it
__label__neu	 Where the deluxe one will have future uses, just snaps together and it overall a MUCH better product
__label__neg	We were rather disappointed with this warmer and ended up returning it and getting the Dex warmer which works MUCH better
__label__neg	 Warmers are meant to just take the chill out of the wipes but this one didnt do that very well
__label__neg	 The lid is also inconvenient to use - you have to push a button to open and close it each time; no easy flipping like the Dex
__label__neg	 Not worth it
__label__neg	Looks cute, but started falling apart within 6 months
__label__neg	 We have washed it a few times and the edge is fraying and coming off
__label__neu	I live in a condo and have cordless phones and wireless internet
__label__neg	 I found this product had terrible static
__label__neu	 In comparison, the Fisher Price 900mhz Long Range Monitor sounded excellent
__label__neu	I've tried offering this to my baby several times beginning at 6 months
__label__neu	 She is now 9
__label__neg	5 months and still won't use it
__label__neu	 I put banana in it, her favorite food and try to show her how to use it to eat it
__label__neg	 But she is just not interested
__label__neg	 She didn't even really want to play with it as a toy
__label__neg	 Also the price they are charging here is too high
__label__neu	 I found it for several dollars less at Target
__label__neu	Ok, so the dresser was only $200 (plus shipping), but I would have rather had a little more drawer space
__label__neg	" The fronts of the drawers measure almost 9"", but the insides are only 3-1/2"" deep"
__label__neu	 As others have said, the front of the drawers and outer casing of the dresser are pretty solid, but the drawers themselves are particle board
__label__pos	 It took about an hour to put together and according to my husband, the instructions were easy to follow and there were no pieces missing
__label__neu	 I would only recommend this item if you are looking for a dresser that looks nice but don't need a lot of storage space
__label__neg	This sounded good in theory, but didn't work at all
__label__neg	 They were correctly installed by my husband, but the magnet is just not strong enough to get it to open
__label__neg	 It was a waste of money for our cabinets
__label__neg	 It may work if you have the thinner particle board cabinets, but it definitely didn't work through our solid wood cabinets
__label__neg	Absolutely the worst
__label__neu	 The little notches on the side are baby finger sized and they come right out
__label__neu	 Buy the old school kind for REAL safety
__label__neu	when i became pregnant i planned on using these bottles, i bought everything bottle warmer,sterilizer,breast pump, and a ton of bottles and nipples
__label__neg	 well 2 weeks into using them i threw them out the window
__label__neg	 my daughter had very bad gas
__label__neg	 when i switched bottles the gas stopped
__label__neg	 Plus the bottles are expensive
__label__neu	you have to keep buying new nipples there are sooo many different sizes
__label__neg	 a waste i think, most bottles have 2 fast or slow but there seemed to be 4 different sizes or more
__label__pos	I am obsessed with my Swaddle Designs blankets, and use them exclusively to swaddle my 4 1/2 month old for every nap & every night
__label__pos	 With summer here, I was more than excited to discover this thinner options
__label__neg	 However, after multiple tries, my son would wiggle free from the Lightweight Marquisette every time
__label__neg	 I don't know why, but this product really didn't work for us
__label__neu	This is a good blanket, but it only fit my newborn for 2 months
__label__neu	 I don't see how any average sized baby can fit in this for longer than that
__label__neg	 Currently my baby is 23 inches long and the pocket for her legs force her to bend her knees
__label__neg	" I wish I could return this item, but they won't take it back if your child just ""outgrew"" it"
__label__neu	This is the only bottle warmer I have ever used so I really have nothing to compare it to
__label__pos	 However, I stopped using it after a couple of weeks and realized my son took the bottle just fine without the need to warm up the bottle
__label__neg	 It was difficult to get the bottle at the right temp - it was either too hot or too cold
__label__neg	 By the time I had it at an acceptable temp, my baby was already screaming for the bottle
__label__neg	 The bottle would sometimes be too hot and would leak at the top
__label__neg	 That left a residue at the bottom of the warmer which would emit a weird odor that might make you think something is burning
__label__neg	 You might have better luck with it but it just didn't work for us
__label__neu	i suppose this seat is better than layering tons of toilet paper on a toilet bowl
__label__pos	 this folding seat may be appealing to little ones because it comes decorated with familiar characters (e
__label__neu	g
__label__neu	, sesame street, dora, etc)
__label__neg	 but there is nothing to hold it in place on a toilet seat
__label__neg	 my twins can't relax enough to 'go' while sitting on it because the hinges are flimsy so the seat feels like it's about to give way under them
__label__neg	 they're small (27lb) 2yos, so i can't imagine what would happen if they weighed more
__label__neg	 save your money and get a more stable travel potty seat
__label__neu	I bought this because my back & belly need some support while sleeping
__label__neg	but this pillow doesn't help
__label__neg	 It's WAY TOOOO BIG
__label__neu	for my queen size bed
__label__neu	It divides me & my boyfriens up completely
__label__neg	i always have to sleep with two pillows under my head, so this pillow doesn't allow me to because it's so bulky
__label__neu	I have now switched this pillow around & reversed it so the Head Part of the Pillow is now at my feet & I use it as a foot elavation pillow
__label__neg	 NOT worth the $$$ I would just buy the Tummy Wedge by Boppy for Belly Support :) Cheaper & does the job
__label__neu	 Hope this helps any new mommy's out there
__label__neg	I wonder if i could send it back
__label__neu	 It's been a little over 3 weeks
__label__neu	 Hummmm
__label__pos	I loved this product at first and I know my daughter enjoyed it for the first two months
__label__neg	 After a while though, it began drying out too quickly and literally burning the wipes on the bottom
__label__neg	 The last thing you want to have to do is throw away 1/3 of your wipes because they are brown and dry
__label__neg	DO NOT BUY THIS MONITOR
__label__neg	 It is horrible
__label__neg	 All you hear is static
__label__neg	 So much static that sometimes I don't even hear my baby
__label__neg	 The lights are always going on because of the noise from the static but sometimes the lights don't work & ofcourse that is when my baby is making noise
__label__neg	 I try to sleep with this on my night stand but can't because of the static
__label__neu	 There are 2 channels
__label__neg	 One has static and the other is the worst sound you will ever hear
__label__neg	 This monitor makes me crazy listening to static all day & all night
__label__neu	 I am going out tomorrow to purchase a new monitor
__label__neg	 Don't waste your money
__label__neu	 You get what you pay for
__label__neg	DO NOT WASTER YOUR MONEY ON THIS TUB
__label__neg	 IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK
__label__neg	MY BABY WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE IN THIS TUB, YOU ALSO ONLY HAVE ONE FREE HAND TO WASH THE BABY 
__label__neg	 IT ALSO LEAKS FROM THE BOTTOM
__label__neg	First of all the bulb syringe it's TOO HARD, and worst: it did not suck at all (the blue one from the hospital have been a life saver)
__label__neg	 The brush is too rough for a baby under 2, and the comb I started to use it when my daughter was 3 months old, because is too rough for a newborn
__label__neu	 The nail clipper is too big for my daughter little The comb it's OK
__label__neg	 The nail fillers are way TOO ROUGH too
__label__neg	 The dropper is TOO BIG
__label__neg	I REGRET of spending my money in this
__label__neu	Keep searching for another set
__label__neu	UPDATE---> I'm writing this note because after reading my comment after a year I have to say that I wrote this review stating that the items doesn't work for a newborn as they promise, but most of the items you can use them for an older baby
__label__pos	 I have to say that the nail clipper has been the best one ever since my daughter was 15 months old, and after my husband step on it an broke it I run to the store and bought another one: Lucky me that I found it in a smaller set just with the scisors and the nail fillers and I didn't had to buy the whole kit again
__label__neg	I purchased this item yesterday, and it will go back to the store tomorrow
__label__neu	 I got it together, turned it on, and the motor on the thing was louder than the music
__label__neg	 It really does sound as though the motor is straining and it will break any minute
__label__neg	 There is no way I will be able to tolerate the motor to put my baby to sleep
__label__neg	I bought this because of the excellent reviews, so I felt it necessary to add my review that is not as positive
__label__neu	"My son is 3'3"" & 30 pounds"
__label__neg	 (he is almost 3 yr old) He does fit on this potty, but it leaves horrible red marks in his inner thighs after only sitting on it a few minutes
__label__neg	" It hurt his bottom so badly that he cried & said ""oh mommy my legs"
__label__neu	""" It's not great to start potty training with a painful experience"
__label__neg	 He is now afraid of it
__label__neu	I don't know if my son just has very sensitive skin or if it's because he is too big for the chair, but I switched to a soft seat that goes on the big toilet & we are trying that now
__label__neg	 I wouldn't recommend this potty for larger children
__label__neg	I guess I am never going to find a sun shade that actually sticks to my windows
__label__neg	 Even with cleaning them often using alcohol, as the manual suggests, they fall off every single day
__label__neg	 How frustrating
__label__neu	 Might as well save myself the frustration and get my windows tinted
__label__neu	This cover is just that, a cover
__label__neg	 It provides zero warmth and barely acts as a barrier between the cold and your baby
__label__neu	 The paperwork included with the cover even instructs you not to rely on the cover for warmth and to dress your baby for the weather
__label__neu	 I had hoped to use this while on a recent trip to canada as strollers are impossible on the snow and ice covered sidewalks
__label__neg	 This was a huge disappointment
__label__neg	I had nothing but leakage problems with these bottles
__label__neu	 I contacted the company and they told me all these different tips of assembling the bottles that should stop leakage
__label__neg	 Needless to say none worked
__label__pos	 Luckily for me I was able to return the larger bottles
__label__neg	 I am although stuck with eight of the smaller ones
__label__neg	 First off let me say when you are sleep deprived you dont' want to be worrying if the bottle lip has a drop of water on it that will cause it to leak or if you have over tightened or under tightened
__label__neu	 There is no time to worry about all these little things when you have a hungry screaming baby
__label__neg	 The bottles are by far not cheap and there shouldn't be so many issues
__label__neg	 I have many friends that have said that theirs leaked as well
__label__neu	too bad they didn't tell me before I registered for them
__label__neu	 Oddly enough if you buy a bottle in the 
__label__neu	99 cent store you don't have all these issues
__label__neu	 When I returned the larger ones to Babies R US there were a lot of other returns as well
__label__neu	 I will give these to my daughters to play with their dolls
__label__neg	 In addition to the leakage I noticed that my son was extremely gassy and would cry so much after eating
__label__neg	 I have told my friends who are registering now to save their money and find an alternate bottle
__label__pos	This monitor worked great for the first week
__label__neg	 Then, there was so much static I couldn't sleep, and I couldn't hear the baby clearly
__label__neu	 I highly recommend the Sony babycall monitor (also carried by Babies R Us, but not online)
__label__neu	 It has a wonderful voice activated only feature that allows perfect silence from the monitor unless baby is fussing (i
__label__neu	e
__label__neu	, you won't hear the vacuum cleaner or the dryer or the neighbor's dog barking, etc
__label__neu	 - it only turns on when the baby cries or your spouse talks, etc
__label__neu	) I bought the Sony and retired the Fisher Price and am sleeping better than I have in weeks
__label__neu	I registered for this product and received it at my baby shower
__label__pos	 I thought it would be wonderful
__label__neg	 I was wrong
__label__neu	 My daughter who was 8 pounds 11 ounces at birth would slide down the Inclined to Sleep positioner
__label__neg	 In fact, a few times I would go in to check on her and her head would be in between the two foam sides
__label__neg	 SCARY
__label__neu	 This started happening after about 3 weeks of age
__label__pos	 Until this age she was fine with it
__label__neu	but by 3 weeks
__label__neg	she was wiggling and moving too much to use the pillow part
__label__neu	 I am thankful that nothing happened to her when she sild down the pillow
__label__neg	 Because of this safety issue I would never reccommend this product to anyone
__label__neg	 It's not worth the risk
__label__pos	My baby loves, loves, loves this swing
__label__pos	 We love it because it swings two ways
__label__pos	 If he gets fussy swinging one way, we turn him around and swing him the other way
__label__neg	Now, the reason for the two stars: the motor went out
__label__neu	 Twice
__label__neu	 We purchased the first swing in December 06
__label__neg	 In February the motor went out and we had to get another one
__label__neg	 Then just today, April 25, 07 the motor conked out AGAIN
__label__neg	We don't even turn on the lights for our baby because they distract him
__label__neu	 All he ever does is swing
__label__neu	 I don't think we got a lemon
__label__neu	 TWICE
__label__neg	 I think it's a flaw in the motor
__label__neu	Someone talked about this item not being sturdy
__label__pos	 It doesn't feel sturdy but it is
__label__neu	 It has to stand on two legs because you need to turn the swing
__label__pos	 We've never had any problems with it breaking down
__label__neg	 We only have motor issues
__label__neg	At $159 the motor should not go out
__label__neg	 I'd stay away from it
__label__neu	If you can get another model that swings both ways, do that
__label__pos	 That's the only feature that is absolutely fantastic about it
__label__neu	I purchased this alongside renting a hospital grade pump
__label__neg	 This hand pump is not worth the money
__label__neg	 The rubber filter keeps popping out when there is a lot of suction
__label__neu	 Maybe the women who liked this pump had smaller nipples than I do
__label__neg	 Every time I have used this the rubber pops out
__label__neu	 To put it back in you have to completely unscrew the cap and put your fingers in
__label__neg	 A bad design and not at all sterile
__label__neg	 Do not waste your money
__label__pos	 I complained to avent and although they had good customer service and sent me out a new pump, it did exactly the same thing
__label__neg	 It is the product itself that is defective
__label__neg	I had to return the bundle me because it doesn't fit our Peg Perego Primo Viaggio SIP 30/30 car seat
__label__neu	 The car seat has side impact protection wings by our baby's head (which I love for the added safety) but it meant that the bundle me didn't fit
__label__neg	 First I tried stretching the back of the bundle me over the side impact wings which made it impossible to fit the 5-point harness straps through the bundle me without interfering with the straps positioning to the point that I thought it was unsafe because the straps had to loop up and around to get through the holes
__label__neg	 Then I tried not putting the bundle me over the impact wings but that left a lot of extra fabric where the baby's head would be, which I thought was a suffocation hazard
__label__neg	 In the end I just wasn't comfortable that my son could be safe in his car seat with the Bundle Me
__label__neg	 I was very disappointed because I thought the Bundle Me would be perfect to keep my winter baby warm through a New England winter
__label__neg	 I got the Kiddipotamus CozyUp Black/Red or BLue/Ivory Kiddopotamus CozyUp Carrier Covers instead because it goes over the top of the car seat only and it worked really well
__label__neu	 My son seemed comfortable with it and I didn't have to worry about anything interfering with how the car seat was designed to work
__label__pos	70% of the time, the tub doesn't leak
__label__neg	 The 30% that it does leak, however, is a fiasco
__label__neu	" Here's how it happens: Once the tub is full expanded and the clips under the side are ""clicked"" into place (and yes, we did read the instructions) we fill the tub"
__label__neu	 Once we finish bathing her, we slide the entire unit forward just enough so that the drain hangs over the edge of the sink and let the water drain
__label__neg	 It is at this point that by moving the tub, the suction cups stick to the counter and while moving the tub, it unhooks the clips and out come the waterworks
__label__neu	all over the hardwood floors
__label__neg	 And let me tell you, it isn't easy to remedy this while holding a wet, squirmy baby
__label__neg	 Mothers (and fathers) have far better things to do with their time than fiddle with the damn clips and mop up a huge mess
__label__neg	 My husband, an MD and engineer says it is obviously incapable of maintaining a reliable seal
__label__neu	 Look at it
__label__neu	 Meanwhile, we're shopping for a different type of tub
__label__neg	 We cuss too much using this one
__label__neg	The thermometer function in this tub worked for about 5 baths, not it is completely out of order and alarm starts to sound at temperature 85 (measured with another thermometer) showing that it is over a 100
__label__neg	Also, we bought this for a new born and it was rather uncomfortable in the beginning because he would slide all over the place
__label__neg	now that he is 2 month it's already getting small for him
__label__neg	would not recommend this product
__label__neu	As a new mother, I wanted to get everything that would make the baby comfortable
__label__neu	 As the months go by, I realized that there are some things I could have done without
__label__neg	 this is one of the things
__label__neg	 Quite frankly, I think it drys out the wipes, and only warms the first two on top
__label__neg	My son really likes this cup, but I found out it is made of polycarbonate plastic, which is known to be toxic
__label__neu	 So I threw it out and bought the larger flip n' sip cups, which are made of safe polypropylene plastic
__label__neu	 My only comlaint is that they don't have handles and are a little big
__label__neu	 If only Nuby made a PP version of the 2 handled sip n' flip
__label__neu	I bought this pump months before my son was born because I could not afford to pay almost $300 for the Medella
__label__neu	 I had a manual Medella pump when my daughter was born and did not want to go manual again
__label__neu	When I returned home from giving birth to my son, he stopped latching on well, so I pulled out my new electric pump and went to work
__label__pos	 It was great
__label__pos	 I could adjust the suction, and my breasts were healing from my son's poor nursing
__label__pos	 I was even getting out 5-6oz of milk from each breast
__label__neu	 The whole process took about 20-30 minutes
__label__neg	After 2 months of constant use, 4 times a day, one day last week the suction would not work
__label__neg	 The motor was running but no suction
__label__neg	 I took all the washable parts off again and put them back on 6 times, before it started working again
__label__neg	 But then it also pulled some milk down the hose, luckly it did not go into the motor
__label__neg	Now when I use it, the suction is not as strong or as efficient
__label__neg	 It now takes an hour or more to pump the same amount of milk I had been getting
__label__neg	 And it still doesn't have anough suction to completly empty my breasts
__label__neg	 When I finish pumping I have to express the remaining milk maually
__label__neu	I am going to call the company, I really hope they make this right
__label__neg	I bought these bottles for my newborn and initially found the vent system to be working but after 2 weeks all the vent systems on the 6 bottles we had stopped working simultaneously and the nipples were collapsing
__label__neg	 I had to keep pulling the bottle away from my hungry baby to allow air in bottle
__label__neg	 These suck
__label__neg	 Don't waste your money when other companies offer the same BPA free products for a fraction of the price
__label__neu	 I returned these to Babies R' Us for a credit and bought Playtex Drop-In system bottles (liners are BPA free) and they have been great
__label__neu	 Gas my baby had been experiencing also seemed to decrease after switching as he is not sucking as hard
__label__neg	"I am 5'8"" and it just does not work well"
__label__neg	 If my head is comfortable the bottom does not hook well between my legs, if it hooks well between my legs it it like I am being strangled
__label__pos	 I had the Snoogle for my first pregnancy and it was great
__label__neg	 I had high hopes for this but just not long enough
__label__neu	 I am hoping it works out maybe for breastfeeding
__label__neg	I think this is a waste of money
__label__neg	 Not very useful
__label__neg	 There are better ones out there
__label__pos	I had some of these that came with my Medela pump and like some other reviewers I thought they would be a good deal since I've really liked my Medela pump
__label__neg	 I really didn't like using them with the twist ties
__label__neg	 That didn't make sense to me at all
__label__neu	 I tried the First Years that have a zip-loc top and they've worked better
__label__neu	 They sit on their own and don't need to be set in a cup
__label__neu	I do prefer using bottles to store milk and have found the Mother's Milk Mate storage bottles to be a great cheap alternative for storage bottles
__label__neu	My son was two weeks early (38 weeks) and as I wasn't informed, allowed him to use this in the hospital
__label__neu	 He took it it, though later would prefer Avent paci's but this along with other artificial nipples added to problems I would have breastfeeding him
__label__pos	 Trips to laction consultants later and I found a way, and left this soothie behind
__label__neg	 Don't be lulled into a false sense of security believing that using this won't interfere with early breastfeeding
__label__neg	 Nipple confusion is very real and disruptive to breastfeeding moms who encounter it
__label__neg	The soothie has no cover, transporting this requires a paci holder pod, which to me is a waste of money if you buy binkys that have covers on their own
__label__pos	 So okay binky
__label__neu	 My son liked it, but it's not a fail proof soother for breastfed babies in the beginning
__label__neu	Enough said
__label__neg	This product is difficult to use, especially if you have two cords plugged in to the same outlet
__label__neg	 It is extremely difficult to get the cover on
__label__neg	 The space for the cord is so small, you have to be very precise about where you place the cord
__label__neg	 In the one case that I actually got the cover on, I could not get it off
__label__neg	I agree with the other poster who said this needs to be recalled
__label__pos	 We used it fine with our newborn for a while, I actually loved it
__label__neg	 However, one afternoon I found it bunched up around my 1 month old daughters neck
__label__neg	 She is a real squirmer and easily would break out of regular swaddles so I thought this thing would be a good idea but it turned out to be too dangerous
__label__neg	 I also filed a complaint with the government consumer safety agency
__label__neu	 I'm using a SwaddleMe now and it works much better, it can't bunch up around the neck
__label__neu	 I heard a Woombie is good too
__label__neg	This potty is driving me crazy
__label__neg	 Unless my daughter sits on it in a particular way, she ends up messing up the floor, AND SHE'S A GIRL
__label__neu	 I don't know what the problem is; perhaps the hole in the seat is simply too small
__label__neg	" If I position her in the correct position, a mess is avoided, but she can't find that ""perfect position"" by herself"
__label__neg	 That's a lot to ask of a two year old
__label__neu	 She has no problem at all with a different padded potty seat that sits on top of the toilet
__label__neu	I bought several of these for my daughter
__label__neu	 First, she was too small, so I swaddled her using a traditional blanket
__label__neg	 Then, they fit, but the fabric would stretch out during the night and she'd get her arms up and wake herself up
__label__neu	 Finally we spent the extra money for an Amazing Miracle Blanket
__label__neu	 It is AMAZING and worth every penny--instead of buying several of these, buy ONE Amazing Miracle Blanket and test it out
__label__neu	 You'll see that I am right
__label__neg	Yes they leak, I mean POUR milk from under the sealing ring
__label__neg	 Don't waste your money
__label__neg	 If you are crazy enough to buy them SAVE YOUR RECEIPT
__label__neg	Don't waste your money on this product
__label__neu	 I bought the tie on cloth cover for the front rail of the crib, and decided to try to save some money on a cover for the side rails
__label__neg	 It didn't even stay on for a day
__label__neg	 Money down the drain, since I now have to replace it with a cloth cover
__label__neu	This carrier has been nice to use when I walk my dog or go shopping instead of bringing a stroller
__label__neg	 The shoulder padding tends to slide around since they are not attached to the straps
__label__neg	 When this does happen, the straps dig into my shoulder
__label__neu	 Also, it took quite some time before my son was able to face forward
__label__neu	 He could hold his head well enough long before he was tall enough to face forward, but my baby didn't mind facing me
__label__neu	 Some similar carriers fold down by the babies face so they can face forward easier
__label__neu	I checked the online reviews of this product before spending the money on it
__label__neu	 I was having difficulty getting comfortable and sleeping at night so I decided to try the Snoogle
__label__neg	 I have since returned the Snoogle
__label__neg	 I felt I could not get the pillow in position to be comfortable
__label__neg	 The top curve was in the way of my regular pillow and the bottom curve was never in the right spot if I had the long part of the pillow up against me
__label__neg	 I also felt that the pillow did not support my belly very well because it is so thick-I felt uncomfortable with it under me
__label__neu	 I prefer the regular body pillows and find much more comfort using them-for a lot less money
__label__neu	I don't think every newborn likes to be swaddled
__label__neu	 My newborn did not like being swaddle, he liked his hands to be free
__label__neg	 I received this as a shower gift and tried using it the first few days when he came home, but he really didn't like feeling constrained
__label__neg	 I really would not register for this product again
__label__neg	 Most newborn outgrow swaddling that in my opinion it is not worth buying this product in the long run
__label__neg	I thought this would be a great way to get my bottles clean but you still have to scrub them clean first yourself, THEN prepare this thing to stick in the microwave for x-amt of time, THEN wait for it to cool
__label__neg	 too much to do prior to getting a bottle ready for a fussy baby
__label__neu	&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;If your baby has an immune promblem, then this may be great for you, otherwise, skip on this and just buy a nice bottle brush
__label__neu	 I like the one by Munchkin
__label__neg	 He didn't mind carting it around once in a while, but after a while he began to protest that he was always carrying a purse around
__label__neg	 :) We ended up getting a more unisex looking model that both of us liked
__label__neg	(Also, this doesn't have a refrigerated compartment, which is important if you're carrying stored breastmilk)
__label__neg	my mother purchased this gate because she didnt want to put holes in the wall, and it is similar to the hardware mounted gate i own and love
__label__neg	 the one she bought is a piece of crap, after trying to put it up for 10 minutes, and it still isnt secure
__label__neg	I based my decision to purchase this pump based on all the reviews it got
__label__neg	 However, it takes me about 20 minutes to pump 4 ounces
__label__neg	 on a good day
__label__neg	 Luckily, I have an awesome boss, who allows me all the time I need to pump
__label__neg	 I average 2-3 ounces every hour and half
__label__neg	 at 20 minutes at a time
__label__neg	 which is rediculous
__label__neg	 If I could, I would purchase an electric pump, because as my baby grows, I don't see how I'd be able to catch up to her growing appetite using this pump, and not spend my whole day in the bathroom pumping
__label__pos	 On the plus side
__label__pos	 all the litle extras it came with are great, and the case is discreet and keeps the bottles cold for a few hours
__label__neg	This item is not bpa free as described
__label__neg	 The straw contains BPA
__label__neg	 Also, this is a horrible product because you can not clean the straw
__label__neg	 It is closed off at one end with only tiny holes and the other end is folded into the lid
__label__neg	 If you take the lid apart, you can not put it back together
__label__neg	 Had to throw ours away after a couple of uses (we purchased this before we knew it had BPA)
__label__pos	My husband and I were ecstatic when we received a Peg Perego travel system for our shower
__label__neg	 We love the stroller and infant seat together, BUT the infant seat base is unable to be installed properly in our Subaru Forester
__label__neg	 Our seatbelts are too thin and the accessory that is supposed to take care of this problem is to large to properly fit on the belt between the base and the latch
__label__neg	 As a result, the carseat slides from side to side
__label__neg	 The fire dept
__label__neg	 personnel has recommended we not use the infant seat in our car
__label__neg	I didn't like this because I couldn't see my son in the mirror
__label__neg	 I drive an SUV and I found a bigger mirror instead
__label__neg	I bought this in hope of my son will be able to drink milk from this cup
__label__neg	 It was useless after I took it apart and had to wash it
__label__neg	 I tried so hard to putting it back together
__label__neg	 But, it still leaks
__label__neg	 I basically toss it out after many times of trying
__label__neg	 What a waste of money
__label__neg	My son also rips these right off the table
__label__neg	 He is almost 11 months old so hopefully he will do better with them when he is older (fortunately I only bought the 20 pack)
__label__neg	 This is a great idea in theory but for my curious son it is not practical
__label__neg	 I am back to using my antibacterial wipes to clean the table off which is the only effective method that I have found so far
__label__pos	Update: I have recently found two alternatives of this same concept that have worked out well
__label__pos	 The local Dollar Tree sells their own version of table toppers that cling quite well (pack of 8 for $1) and the Hippopatamus brand that Target sells that have great educational themes of ABCS and numbers 1-10
__label__pos	 These wrap around the edge of the table and cover more area than the previously reviewed brand
__label__neg	This is a good idea, but for a little kid, it's a little complicated
__label__neg	 My son doesn't like that he get's his hand stuck in there between the wedges (and he's 1), and then trying to get it out, he dumps cheerios all over
__label__neg	 Good thought, but I think it needs to be redesigned
__label__neg	I would never reccommend these bottles to anyone
__label__neg	 I am a nursing Mother and thought these bottles we suppsose to mimic the breast
__label__neg	 They do just the opposite
__label__neg	 There were so many bubbles in the bottle that I could hear them
__label__neg	because of this it caused my 3 week old to become gassy and very cranky
__label__pos	 I soon switched to playtex nursers and she is great with them
__label__pos	 The nipples on the Playtex Nurser are much softer and mimic the breast much more closely than the Avent
__label__neg	 Over all, the Avent bottles are a waste of money
__label__neg	first of all, they fall off the windows constantly
__label__neg	" secondly, the ""hot alert"" button turned red in the middle of sub zero temperatures in the winter when the sun was shining on it"
__label__neg	 thirdly, the sun shines through around it and my kid screamed anyway
__label__neg	they are now in the dump and i'm out 25 bucks
__label__neg	Our little girl has the worst gas pains, but this waistband didn't help at all
__label__neg	 I was also worried at how hot it got (following the instructions), so we wouldn't heat it for as long as it said
__label__pos	 For gas, I recommend Hyland's Colic Tablets over anything else (and we've tried everything-having 2 gassy, gassy babies
__label__neg	)
__label__pos	 They instantly soothe her stomach so she can sleep, and they're a natural, homeopathic remedy
__label__pos	Good while it worked
__label__pos	 My baby really liked the sounds and the night light was great for midnight feedings
__label__neg	 I only had it for three weeks when it stop working
__label__neg	 I changed batteries thinking that was the problem but the next day it stop working again
__label__neg	 It didn't play music and light would not turn off
__label__neg	 I am really disappointed
__label__neg	 Buyer beware
__label__neg	I got this toy and the packaging was covered with scotch tape and quite sad looking
__label__neg	 It would not work when I took it out of the packaging so I checked the batteries and they were corroded
__label__neg	 I put new batteries in and it still doesn't work
__label__neg	 I'm returning it
__label__pos	Excellent performance of the product, is fast, quiet, comfortable, spacious, included a number bottles and the pump all at once
__label__pos	 It has easy maintenance
__label__neg	The only problem that I have was that by buying by Amazon, I had no access to technical service and warranty in Venezuela because here only covers the devices purchased in the country
__label__neg	In my case, only 2 months after use the sterilizer,the system not run properly and I had to buy a new 
__label__pos	The sterilizer Avent is so good that i do not hesitate to buy a new one, I attribute the failure to trip was the product of USA to Venezuela
__label__neg	This product is not versatile nor effective enough for me to recommend it
__label__neg	" We got it as a gift and I tried using it every day for about two weeks and my baby would just look at me thinking ""are you crazy mom"
__label__neg	 there is NO way I will sit still in this
__label__neg	""" She would just squirm around trying to get out"
__label__neg	 It is much too slow to do anything for a baby and is bulky and ugly and heavy as well
__label__pos	 I got a lot more use out of the Baby Bjorn Sitter which is a little more money but my baby likes it, sits in it for at least 10 minutes (that is a lot for her
__label__pos	) and it folds flat and does not require batteries
__label__neg	I registered and received this monitor as a shower gift
__label__neg	 I thought it would be great
__label__neg	 My daughter is 10 months now and I have already bought another monitor
__label__neg	 Within the first month of use the hand-held audio only monitor broke
__label__pos	 The video actually works really well and aside for some NOISY interference that it picks up sometimes, its a great picture day or night
__label__neg	 The camera is kind of a pain, though
__label__neg	 The way that it is angled, you need to mount it on the wall above the crib, or have it sitting on a tall piece of funiture that can overlook the crib
__label__neg	 I don't have that, so we only really use it for the sound
__label__neg	 The monitor is very large, though, and so it would have been nice if the hand held auido one worked - so I could take it to another room
__label__neg	 This model has too many problems I wouldn't buy it if I could do it over again
__label__neg	It is a great space saving design, but as noted by other reviewers, does NOT work with glass bottles
__label__neg	 It's very cheap flimsy plastic
__label__neg	 The polls on the bottom layer started to bend over with the glass bottles, and what is worst, after 1 day of usage the top rack collapsed to the bottom because I was using glass bottles (and not all the prongs were even used)
__label__pos	 I ended up getting the Skip Hop Drying Rack, and it is working very well for me
__label__neg	 I only wish they could make a STRONG two tier design one day
__label__pos	My daughter loves balls and she loves chewing on tags
__label__pos	 When my husband and I saw this product at a local toy store we could not wait to buy it and watch her with it
__label__neg	 We have been waiting for her to play with it for two months
__label__neg	 She is just not interested in it at all
__label__neg	 We have received other taggies products (soft books and a board book) and she does not play with them either
__label__neg	 My daughter loves to play and can spend hours knocking down block towers, chewing on books or rolling balls, but she is not impressed with taggies and neither are we
__label__pos	" However, I took the ""toss the taggie"" ball to a group play date and some of the older toddlers seemed to enjoy it"
__label__neg	"This monitor is ""staticky"""
__label__neg	 I mean if it's the only one you have then it's fine because you can still hear your child, but the amount of static is annoying and kind of distracting if you are trying to do work
__label__neg	 I would suggest that parents shop around before purchasing an item that is cheaper
__label__neg	The nail clippers,hairbrush, and comb are great but I did not care for the rest
__label__neg	 It would be cost effective to buy the items seperately from this company
__label__neg	The old lids were good the new lids don't let enough air back into the cup so after child has sucked for a few seconds the spout inverts back into the cup
__label__neg	 You have to remove the lid, allow air back into the cup and the spout to return to normal position and then put the lid back on
__label__neg	 I have no idea why the company would change this
__label__neg	 I compared the old with the new and it is different
__label__neg	 They also drip so if they are not sitting upright, they will leak water
__label__neg	 The good is they are BPA free and easy to hold but I would look for another brand
__label__neg	I was told that this was a top of the line monitor but after receiving it as a gift, I had to return it because of all the static
__label__neg	 I could not hear my baby at all
__label__neg	 I purchased the Sounds and Light Monitor instead 
__label__pos	 and I'm very satisfied with the exchange
__label__neg	We thought this bathtub would be great for our newborn son, but he was never comfortable in it : the sling gets very cold when wet, and the baby's back keeps bumping into the plastic part underneath
__label__neg	 We only kept the toys that came with it and gave away the tub
__label__pos	My advice is to buy a very simple tub such as Safety 1st, it's enough and frankly babies like them best 
__label__neg	First, we read the directions and we follwed them
__label__neg	 But this never seemed to work the same way twice
__label__neg	 Sometimes at 4 min
__label__neg	 the formula was too hot and sometimes at 6 min
__label__neg	 it wasn't hot enough
__label__neg	 There was no rhyme or reason to it, we had it set the same way every time
__label__neg	 We used it for a month and then threw in the towel
__label__neg	I bought a diaper genie for my baby, despite numerous people telling me it wasnt worth it
__label__pos	 It was fine at first
__label__neg	 My baby is only a month old and im already giving it away
__label__neg	 My first complaint is that the first few diapers wont stay wrapped
__label__neg	 As soon as i put another diaper in it unravels the first diaper and the second drops down with the first
__label__neg	 IT keeps doing this until the bag is too heavy and wont wrap at all
__label__neg	 My second complaint is that the cutter doesnt work
__label__neg	 It will cut about an inch or two and then stop and every time i try to do it again it just doesnt work, so i end up cutting it with scissors
__label__neg	 This thing is WAY too much work for a diaper pail
__label__neg	 ANd its a pain to get the diaper down in there when trying to hold onto a wriggling baby too
__label__neg	 In my opionion its NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ALL
__label__neg	 I wouldnt recommend this to ANYONE
__label__pos	 I bout the diaper champ and it is the greatest pail ever
__label__neg	 BUY THE DIAPER CHAMP
__label__neg	I found that in order to keep the wipes warm you had to severly saturate the sponge on the bottom
__label__neg	 Which in turn would leave your wipes so wet you might as well use a wet towel
__label__neg	 The concept works but the design is worthless
__label__neg	My 11 month old loves these (and has since she could first grab) but they do not work like they are designed
__label__neg	 They are impossible for her to squeeze and they are hard for me to get them to connect and stay put
__label__neg	 They are also a cleaning nightmare
__label__neg	 They get very gross on the inside and I cant seem to ever get them clean
__label__neg	 The directions tell you to drain them after each use but I can never get all the water out
__label__neg	 If I can get them clean enough I will just stop using them in the bath
__label__pos	The idea sounded intriguing so I figured I'd give it a try
__label__neg	 To my suprise these cups gave me even more work
__label__neg	 My son easily took the top off of it after I made sure it was on very secure and had a blast shaking his cup full of cheerios all over my entire car
__label__neg	 So, I figured OK, let me try one more time just at the off chance I didn't have the top on perfectly
__label__neg	 Nope, same thing
__label__neg	 A complete waste
__label__neg	 We threw ours in the garbage, no luck here on these
__label__neg	The baby isn't due for a little while but I washed these in preparation
__label__neg	 After reading all the reviews I was very careful in my washing and air dried them
__label__neg	 Won't be wanting to wash them in cold water when they are covered in poo though
__label__neg	I am very disappointed how rough they feel after being washed
__label__neg	 I also had to iron them as the band around the outside must have shrunk less than the rest of the material
__label__neg	 The ironing sort of worked although they still roll up a little around the edges
__label__neg	 I have all the time in the world now compared to when baby arrives, so I hope that this problem resolves itself
__label__neg	 Won't be ironing them when baby is here
__label__neg	 My current advice
__label__neg	don't bother with these
__label__neg	 I'll let you know in Dec when baby arrives if they suddenly turn out to be utterly wonderful
__label__neg	*****UPDATE*******The baby is a year old and I used 5 of these in rotation for the last year
__label__pos	 Only one is ready for the rubbish, the rest have gone into storage for if we have another baby
__label__pos	 I have realised my initial assessment was too harsh
__label__pos	 These saved me having to remove and wash my changing pad cover every time the baby did a #2 that escaped when I changed him - quite regularly
__label__pos	 For the price, I think that they were, in retrospect, quite a good buy
__label__neg	 Sorry Boppy
__label__neg	It pilled up with the wash and dry{tumble low}
__label__neg	 AND it shrunk just the tinest bit so to annoy you because it fits but not quite and you broke your nail trying to get it to touch the bottom of the mattress
__label__neg	 Grrrrrr
__label__neg	These bags leave a lot to be desired
__label__neg	 They don't stand up on their own so you have to set them in a cup when they have milk in them
__label__neg	 They don't lie down flat, so you can't freeze them in a nice flat layer to stack in the freezer
__label__neg	 The twist-tie top causes the bags to freeze with a lot of folds and ridges at the neck - this made it impossible for me to open a frozen bag to add more milk later on
__label__neg	 And I've never been able to tear open the little tab at the bottom to get the milk out - I have to snip the edge with a scissors, which I'm sure defeats the purpose of having a nice, sterile inside
__label__neg	 All in all, I'm really disappointed in these bags, and the only positive side to them is I haven't had any burst in the freezer
__label__neg	yet
__label__pos	I wanted this breastpump because I am a huge Avent customer
__label__neg	 Unfortunatley, breast milk always got between the suction and the funnel (which enables the breastpump to pump)
__label__neg	 If you're going to spend money, then spend it on a more accurate pump
__label__neg	I have to agree with others, it isn't very strong
__label__neg	 My daughter was excited about the print on the seat, but as soon as we used it out in a public bathroom, she wasn't very happy
__label__neg	 It isn't sturdy enough and she wanted off before her business was done
__label__neg	 I have decided to put this one away and maybe for the next one we can use it
__label__neg	 I recommend the more sturdier ones, but they don't fold up as Convenient as this one
__label__pos	 **** I finally found a folding cushy potty seat on another website for $15
__label__pos	00, and I like it much better
__label__neg	** **Look at 2nd picture (not purple one) this is the potty seat I am writing this review about, not sure how this purple one comes up
__label__neg	I received this as a gift and was thrilled that it came with two monitors (a real plus), but cannot stand how much noise it makes
__label__neg	 It constantly emits static, so that my mom cannot even tell if the sound receiver is off or on
__label__neg	This seat was recommended to me by someone who owns a caravan and who had luck with it
__label__neg	 Unfortunately i have a Mountaineer and this car seat just does not fit comfortably anywhere in the back seat in the rear facing position
__label__neg	Problems: The latch cord wasn't long enough so we had to do the seatbelt install instead
__label__neg	The seat is so huge that our only option was to put it behind the front passenger seat
__label__neg	 In order to have it reclined correctly, we had to remove the base, use 3 pool noodles AND a blanket
__label__neg	but now the person in the front passenger seat is too close to the dashboard
__label__neg	 For a family of long legs, this doesn't work out too well
__label__neg	The buckle is very tricky
__label__neg	with practice, you eventually get used to it and the straps keeps twisting
__label__pos	Good things: Seat is comfortable and safe
__label__pos	 Height adjust is super easy, especially in New England weather
__label__neg	when baby may be wearing a snowsuit one day and a sweatshirt the next
__label__pos	 Fabric is easily washable
__label__neg	I wish i had talked to other SUV owners before i bought this one to see what else they recommended
__label__pos	 I will be much happier with it when we can switch to forward facing in 6 months
__label__neg	You're kidding, right
__label__neg	 Surely no one would design a unit to be placed a yard from a sleeping child in a dark room with a big flashing green light on the front of it
__label__neg	yep, they really did
__label__pos	 Incredible
__label__neg	 Good way to ruin an otherwise good product
__label__pos	 No problem with our phone or wi-fi network
__label__pos	 Loud enough
__label__pos	 Good enough range
__label__neg	 But, you gotta be kidding me with the green light encircling the big power button the front of the unit that goes in the child's room
__label__neg	 Arghh
__label__neg	 When will these companies just cut it out with the green lights
__label__neg	After only a few uses and washes, this pad cover started to tear
__label__neg	 It was ripping in the corners, and no matter how gentle I was, the hole got bigger
__label__pos	The color choice is out standing
__label__neg	 
__label__neg	 
__label__neg	however I just wish that it had held up a bit better for us
__label__neg	I have been using this mirror for about a month and a half
__label__neg	 About a week ago--the mirror started to (what I thought was)fog
__label__neg	 I touched the mirror and it wasn't fog
__label__neg	 I am in the process of trying to find the contact information to complain right to the company
__label__neg	 I can't even see my daughter now because the mirror is coated with something which won't come off
__label__pos	 I am frequently in stop and go traffic so it is nice to know what she is doing back there
__label__neg	 I wouldn't buy this product again
__label__neg	all I can say is the smell is horrible
__label__neg	1 star
__label__neg	 Please don't buy this one
__label__neg	After going through a box of Dr
__label__neg	 Browns nursing pads the first month after my baby was born, I decided to go for the washable pads and wanted to use some organic cotton ones
__label__neg	 After I bought these and followed the detailed washing instructions (three times separately in hot water) I tried them out and leaked right through them
__label__neg	 Very disappointed
__label__neg	 Now it's back to the disposable pads
__label__neg	We recently moved into a new house and bought and installed 3 of these gates
__label__neg	 Within one week, our 13 month old broke two of the gates
__label__neg	 Once by holding onto the rungs and shaking the gate the other time by grabbing one of the rungs when he tripped
__label__neg	Both times the rung popped right out breaking at the top and bottom
__label__neg	 This left a gap in the rungs wide enough for our son to stick his head through which means he could get past the gate if we kept it up (which of course we didn't
__label__neg	)
__label__neg	It really doesn't attach well to the car seat or stroller
__label__neg	 I have a Graco Quattro Tour and the straps aren't long enough for either
__label__neg	 My daughter does like the music but it doesn't play long enough and it is irritating to have to continue to activate (she isn't able to)
__label__pos	 I still get some use out of it though
__label__neg	 She likes to pick it up, shake it and then toss it on the floor
__label__pos	*Update*I had to update this posting because this toy has become a big hit in the last few months
__label__neg	 Around my daughter's first birthday she began to play with this
__label__pos	 Now in the car she hits the button and plays the music over and over again
__label__pos	 It is her favorite car toy
__label__pos	 I'm actually glad I purchased it
__label__pos	 Of course it still doesn't attach well to the car seat, but boy does it keep my daugher occupie
__label__neg	 My opinion on this toy has totally changed
__label__neg	This seat has never sat right on any toilet I have encountered and actually made my son frightened to use it
__label__neg	 It would shift and semi-collapse in use if my son squirmed and all in all made potty trips a bad experience
__label__neg	However, I think the same rings true about any folding seat cover since I have used about every one on the market and they all have the same flaws
__label__neg	I say if you are really worried about germs in public restrooms either use a non-folding seat or steer clear of them
__label__neg	 Or just do what I did and make sure your child knows how to properly wash his/her hands after using the restroom
__label__pos	I bought this because it's so much cuter than a rinse cup & my daughter seemed to like it
__label__neg	BUT
__label__neg	I had to spend too much time cleaning it weekly
__label__neg	 Not sure if others have noticed but it does get moldy in the cracks & is extremely difficult to clean because of the shape
__label__neg	 I threw it away & started using a plastic cup & guess what
__label__neg	 my daughter plays with that as well
__label__neg	Too expensive & difficult to clean so not worth the money
__label__neg	I'm surprised this potty got such rave reviews
__label__neg	 My daughter is so uncomfortable with this potty trainer
__label__neg	 She'll sit on it, but it's so small
__label__neg	 The splash guard is what really seems to make it uncomfortable for her
__label__neg	 She's accidental sat on it before and it hurt her
__label__neg	 When she sits on it the splash guard makes her have to sit with her legs open, but as I mentioned the seat is pretty narrow so she can't really sit on it comfortably
__label__neg	The purpose of a baby monitor is to free you up for household chores while still allowing you to know that junior is safe and sound
__label__pos	 Audio does this nicely
__label__neg	 Video only works if you watch it, and if it has audio, as this one does, then why even HAVE video
__label__neg	 Video is an unnecessary expense, because just what is there to SEE inside a baby's crib anyway
__label__neg	 There shouldn't be anything dangerous in there anyway
__label__neg	 Save the $ and get an audio
__label__neg	 As someone else pointed out, reception isn't always good on this model either
__label__neg	 Sell yours on ebay, spend ten bucks for a good audio monitor, and put the rest in baby's college fund where you'll get much more use out of it
__label__neg	We didn't like hearing the constant white noise it makes when on
__label__neg	 It's too loud
__label__pos	 We ended up going with Sony's baby call monitor and LOVE it
__label__neg	 It has voice activation
__label__pos	 So you only hear the monitor when baby is making noise
__label__neg	We bought this wipes warmer for our son's room and it was awful
__label__neg	 The wipes were always hard and brown at the bottom
__label__neg	 We wasted more money throwing ruined wipes away
__label__neg	 We returned it and bought the Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer
__label__pos	 We've had that one for 8 months now and never had a problem with burnt wipes
__label__neg	 I should have paid the money and bought that one in the first place
__label__neg	 Don't waste your money or time buying this wipes warmer- it is cheap and you will regret it
__label__neg	I bought these glass bottles after reading all the articles about bispenol A
__label__neg	 My daughter was used to the Dr
__label__neg	 Brown's bottles and could not get used to this classic bottle
__label__neg	 She got so much air when she sucked on the bottle, we could not use it
__label__neg	I use Playtex DropIns bottles/nipples, which are larger than average nipples
__label__neg	 These nipples do NOT fit well in the nipple compartment of this dishwasher basket
__label__neg	 I can only wash 3 nipples at a time in this basket
__label__neg	 The latches to open the different compartments are very snug, making it difficult to open them quickly or with only one hand
__label__neg	I used this item 3 times, now its collecting dust
__label__neg	 Most books that I've read and my doctor agrees that it really isn't necessary to sterilize bottles
__label__neg	 They only need to be washed in very hot soapy water
__label__neg	 My son goes through tons of bottles a day and its not convenient to sterilize them in this item
__label__neg	 You can only fit 4 bottles in there at a time
__label__neg	 Save your money and wash you bottles well by yourself
__label__neg	You can turn up the volume to hear the baby, but you will be listening to a lot of static and won't be able to sleep at night
__label__neg	 We tried this monitor in 3 different areas of the US, and static everywhere
__label__neg	 Very poorly designed
__label__neg	 Do not buy it
__label__neg	The motor on this toy is SO loud
__label__neg	 I don't know how any baby could fall asleep to this, mine never did
__label__neg	 I looked everywhere for the older version and found it
__label__neg	 What a difference
__label__neg	 That one is so much better and no loud motor
__label__neg	 It is so much more soothing
__label__neg	 Still doesn't put my baby to sleep but he likes looking at it
__label__neg	If you are a 1st time mom with a crying baby and you are doing this by yourself and you cant have 10 eyes, this is a waste of money and I am sure glad I did not spend my own money on this but I felt bad for the person who gave it to me as a gift
__label__neg	 You really have to be on your toes about it and who has the time, nevertheless; the ENERGY
__label__neg	this didnt keep snacks from being all over the place
__label__neg	 my child just thought it was a game to try to get the snacks out of the cup
__label__neg	 waste of money
__label__neg	it just rolls and if you want to leave it on the table for a second (cos moms do need all of thier limbs all the time) forget it
__label__neg	My son (now 9 months old) likes this toy - somewhat
__label__neg	 It can hold his attention for max 2-3 minutes
__label__neg	 There are better and more interactive toys out there
__label__neg	 I would recommend to keep looking
__label__neg	 Also, the music is really low as the speaker is on the bottom and it gets muffled
__label__neg	This pump is very slow so unless you have 45 minutes to an hour to pump 4 ounces, don't get this
__label__neg	 In addition to being slow, it began leaking while in use and this is only after being SPARINGLY used for 5 months
__label__neg	 It's a waste of money all around
__label__neg	This product is definitely not a neccessity
__label__neg	 The wipes stay warm once unplugged for about an hour only, and it's way too big for a travel case
__label__neg	 There is also a too-long cord that hangs off of the case, it's really annoying
__label__neg	 It would have made more sense to have it unplug directly from the case
__label__neg	They don't seem to stick very well
__label__neg	 Also, once they did start to come off, I noticed it was leaving that sticky residue behind on my coffee table
__label__pos	The first one worked nicely for about 2 weeks
__label__neg	 Then the battery died
__label__neg	 Unfortunately we had the old version
__label__neg	 It was glued together
__label__neg	 IE you can not change the battery
__label__neg	 We contacted customer support @ Potty Time inc
__label__pos	 They sent us a new watch free of charge
__label__neg	 Only it was defective
__label__neg	 The screen is angled and only displays when you hit the button
__label__neg	A little disappointed I forced open the first one only to find that it was all rusted out from water via hand washing
__label__neg	 This is a great idea that is red flagged by manufacturing defects
__label__neg	 Great customer support only goes so far
__label__neg	 Its like the newest designed Xbox 360 still has a 50% failure rating
__label__neg	 Who wants to buy that
__label__neg	If you cant make it water resistant put a Velcro strap on it
__label__neg	 Its not easy putting it on or taking it off
__label__neg	If you get one that works take it off to wash their hands
__label__neg	These bottles leak
__label__neg	 It doesn't matter how you assemble them, or if you assemble them wet, or dry, or in space, or in a cave
__label__neg	 They leak
__label__neg	 Terribly
__label__neg	 And Avent knows it
__label__pos	 They will even replace your leaky bottles if you call 1800 54avent
__label__neg	 Of course the ones they replace it with also leak
__label__neg	 Buy Dr
__label__neg	 Browns instead
__label__neg	I registered for this tub when my 10 month old was born because I thought the shower feature would be very handy
__label__neg	 Unfortunately, it only worked twice
__label__neg	 The spray was soo light that by the time I finally got all of the soap rinsed off, she was screaming taht she was ready to get out
__label__neg	 As she got a little taller, around 4 months, there wasn't room for the shower attachment AND her legs
__label__neg	 The sling was very helpful (the only reason this tub got 2 stars)when she wasn't able to sit up, but even then, she wasn't immersed in the water much
__label__neg	 She got cold very quickly
__label__neg	 Also, like other reviewers stated, the sling doesn't fit in my sink like they suggest
__label__neg	 If I had it to do over again, I would purchase a tub with a built in seat
__label__neg	 This tub's blue circle looks like it would prevent slipping, but it isn't all that effective
__label__neg	We started with the Diaper Genie as most new parents seem to do for some reason and we hated it
__label__neg	 The new design is jsut as poor as the original
__label__neg	 It's a total pain to empty and change the bags
__label__neg	 And the bag get a bit costly after a while
__label__neg	 And no matter how we spun the thinkg we still ended up with one big bag of nasty diapers
__label__neg	"not ""sausage links"" for us"
__label__neg	It was a total waste of money
__label__neg	 We returned ours after a couple of weeks and got the Diaper Champ
__label__pos	 We love that thing
__label__pos	 No bags to buy and no stupid spinning
__label__neg	 Save your time money, and sanity
__label__pos	go with a Diaper Champ
__label__neg	I bought these yesterday at babie r us and am now signed in looking for a better option
__label__neg	 I leaked through the entire 6 pack in about 12 hours
__label__neg	 The packaging claims that they are super absorbant and they just aren't
__label__neg	 I leaked through and around the pad
__label__neg	 Save your money for a better product
__label__neg	 I am going to try the Lanoish washables instead since they seem to have a better reviews
__label__neg	"After 12 months, our changing pad has cracks all over the plastic surface of the changing pad, some as big as 2"" in length"
__label__neg	 I suspect in a couple more months we will have to change the pad, once the padding starts to come out
__label__neg	 Very disappointing
__label__neg	We purchased this walker a few months before my daughter was born thinking that it was a good price so why pass it up
__label__neg	 Well, when it finally came time to open up the box, the music didn't work
__label__neg	 In the instructions it says that there is no way to replace the batteries 
__label__pos	" well, if you happen to be married to a very determined ""handy man"", it can be done"
__label__neg	 It's some type of watch battery that costs about $15
__label__neg	 When the music does play it is extremely loud so we don't even use it after going through all of that trouble
__label__neg	 We don't want to hurt our little one's ears
__label__pos	 She does like banging on the steering wheel and playing with the little gadgets on the sides though
__label__neg	 She isn't quite big enough to make it go all by herself so she just sits and plays in it while I'm cooking in the kitchen with a little stool underneath her feet
__label__pos	 I also purchased a stand alone jumper and feel that it was a little more appropriate and money better spent
__label__neg	 Just my opinion though
__label__neg	 :)
__label__neg	I bought this thinking that it was the answer to my swaddling prayers
__label__pos	 When I brought my 8 pound newborn home, I wrapped her in it right away
__label__neg	 She wanted her hands out, which was no big deal
__label__neg	 But then I noticed that she kept waking up because there is too much leg room and she was kicking herself awake
__label__neg	 There is no way to wrap the legs tighter
__label__neg	 I decided to swaddle her the old fashion way in a flannel blanket then wrap her with this on cold nights
__label__neg	 The second night I used this blanket, the velcro stopped sticking
__label__neg	 What a waste of money
__label__neg	We have many allergies in our house, and the scent on these cloths is one of them
__label__neg	 Would be great if these were fragrance free, but as is they are unusable for us and possibly dangerous to those with more severe allergies
__label__neg	 Caution to those
__label__neg	I own one of these things and have used it once
__label__neg	 To be perfectly honest, it is rather a pain
__label__neg	 Yeah, it's cool that it heats up and all, but boiling the thing for 10 mins to get it back to its gel state sucks
__label__neg	 It is also not very lightweight
__label__neg	 I don't know about you, but with the amount of stuff I have in the diaper bag, the last thing I need is this thing weighing me down
__label__neg	 I have found that keeping a clean bottle, a bottle of water at room temp and some powder formula (save your scoops) work the best for feedings on the road
__label__neg	 And if you are at a resturant, it is far easier to just ask for some warm water
__label__neg	 Then you don't have to come home and remember to boil this stupid thing
__label__neg	 I wouldn't buy it again
__label__neg	The miracle middle is nothing special, so if you are a plus size mom on the larger side of plus, don't buy this thinking the pillow will stretch and wrap around you
__label__neg	 I'm very short and this pillow was in a awkward position while breastfeeding, and wasn't long enough to offer the ever important elbow support
__label__neg	 This applies when using the bottle with a heavier baby as well
__label__neg	The pillow is painfully missing back support, and the middle dips and sags
__label__neg	 I only used this pillow for 3-4 months before using one of my regular pillows with a waterproof pad under because it was cumbersome and already losing shape
__label__neg	Use of this as a baby support is okay, better than a regular pillow, though in a pinch rolled up blankets work fine
__label__neg	 While having the ability to customize your pillow style is nice, the added expense for an average product almost negates the pros
__label__neg	The pillow is said to be machine washable, but given the poor quality of the stuffing inside, do so at your own risk
__label__neg	I don't even know what to say
__label__neg	 This pillow is so bad
__label__neg	 It's too flat to align hips
__label__neg	 Awkward under my head, probably too flat there
__label__neg	 There is no stuffing where the pillow lies at my stomach so it is useless to support my belly
__label__neg	 Quite honestly, I'm not sure what Boppy is thinking on this one
__label__pos	I ended up with a snoogle and LOVE it
__label__neg	I called Medela and asked how I could get tubing made by them for the first generation Pump in Style
__label__pos	They sent them to me for free (including free shipping
__label__neg	)
__label__neg	These sheets are not good at all
__label__neg	 I am a big fan of Graco products, but not these
__label__neg	 They are thin, and not soft at all
__label__neg	 I ended up making my own sheets
__label__neg	all you have to do is get a piece of flannel and hem it and make the corners, they don't need elastic since the mattress has bending points in it
__label__neg	 Plus, a lot cheaper
__label__pos	My baby loves, loves, loves this swing
__label__pos	 We love it because it swings two ways
__label__pos	 If he gets fussy swinging one way, we turn him around and swing him the other way
__label__neg	Now, the reason for the two stars: the motor went out
__label__neg	 Twice
__label__neg	 We purchased the first swing in December 06
__label__neg	 In February the motor went out and we had to get another one
__label__neg	 Then just today, April 25, 07 the motor conked out AGAIN
__label__neg	We don't even turn on the lights for our baby because they distract him
__label__neg	 All he ever does is swing
__label__neg	Someone talked about this item not being sturdy
__label__pos	 It doesn't feel sturdy but it is
__label__neg	 It has to stand on two legs because you need to turn the swing
__label__pos	 We've never had any problems with it breaking down
__label__neg	 We only have motor issues
__label__neg	At $159 the motor should not go out
__label__neg	 I'd stay away from it
__label__neg	If you can get another model that swings both ways, do that
__label__neg	 That's the only feature that is absolutely fantastic about it
__label__neg	My son is only 10 months old and can't use this seat because there's not enough space between the seat and the tray
__label__neg	 He's not a fat child, either, only in the 50th % and it cuts right into his belly
__label__neg	 I'll be returning it today
__label__neg	I can't believe how much this shrunk once it was washed
__label__neg	 It never made it to the changing table
__label__neg	 You would think the makers of this would know that every item that is going to touch a baby is going to be washed
__label__neg	 Therefore, have the material be pre-shrunk before marketing it
__label__neg	Before my baby was born I thought I'd love these, but it turns out that I really, really don't
__label__neg	 First of all they are extremely bulky which isn't very conducive to a baby learning to crawl and develop their muscles well because it forces their legs so far apart
__label__neg	My baby pees a lot and I just don't see it worth putting these great big things into the wash after she just peed
__label__neg	 I go through 17 diapers a day (because I change her immediately)
__label__neg	 At this price this is WAY too expensive
__label__neg	 I've found using liners and just five covers works great for me
__label__neg	 And seventeen of these wouldn't even fit in my washer every day
__label__neg	If your baby is a frequent pee-er you might want to consider using something else
__label__neg	I bought these spouts based on great reviews but got extremely disappointed when I start using them
__label__neg	 They leak badly may be because a lot of water bottles were changed for the past year or so
__label__neg	 I wish I got other toppers instead
__label__neg	"We gave these to our 9-month-old twins as their first ""utensil,"" and were very disappointed in the results"
__label__neg	 Whatever food you are serving has to be JUST the right consistency - too thin and it just slides off the dipper, too thick and it won't stick to it
__label__neg	" Our kids did like to mimic Mommy and Daddy using utensils, and they would practice ""eating"" with these, but they could have done just as well with a regular baby spoon"
__label__neg	" Wouldn't waste your money on this ""intro"" utensil"
__label__neg	 Really likeBoon Benders - Adaptable Utensils in Orange/Blueas introductory spoon and fork
__label__neg	I read the reviews about the smell but since most of the reviews were positive I hoped that was an old (solved) problem
__label__pos	 The chest arrive and was spacious and cute
__label__pos	 My tot liked opening the lid and would not get hurt running into it
__label__neg	 But the smell was noxious
__label__neg	 It smells like just produced toxic plastic
__label__neg	 I aired it out for 2 weeks (
__label__neg	) in another room
__label__neg	 Then taking drastic measures (realizing that it ruins the chance of return but hoping to keep this oh so cute box) i dunked it into a cold bath
__label__neg	 After it dried (which it did without any problems btw) it still smelled
__label__neg	 So did the toys left in it overnight
__label__neg	 Sadly the chest went to the curb
__label__pos	Boons Let it Flo seemed like an awesome idea
__label__neg	the idea - awesome but the product not so much
__label__neg	 I tried it on my faucet without a shower stopper and it fell off several times but because it was already out of the box I opted to try it out for the bathtime
__label__pos	when being held in position (by me) the water flowed nicely off it to give a good waterfall to shower off my toddlers soapy head
__label__pos	 And it made the water come into the tub nicely as well
__label__neg	but the jist is:- it doesn't fit my tub (narrow faucet w/o shower stopper)- the item is made of hard plastic not a softer plastic that would be nice for the little kids heads
__label__neg	- from using it three times I could tell it was going to breed some awful mildew & soap residue that was going to be a pain to clean- and while the bubble bath dispenser is a cool idea
__label__neg	it'd be better if you didn't have to continuously push the button to get the soap out
__label__neg	Sorry Boon - I'm usually a big fan - but not today
__label__neg	Decent size cubby to hold toys in the bath, but one side doesn't seem to want to stick to the walls
__label__neg	I have two of these changing pad covers and used them both for a year with my first child
__label__neg	 They are mediocre
__label__neg	 I noticed that the material frayed around the elastic after a few months of use
__label__neg	 I stitched them back up, but it looks kind of cruddy and the material continues to unravel in new places
__label__neg	 I agree with one of the other comments regarding a slit for the safety strap
__label__neg	one is not present
__label__neg	" Finally, I used it with the changing pad by ""Especially for Baby"" and the fit was a bit too tight which resulted in the pad curving a bit over time"
__label__neg	For a few more dollars, I would strongly recommend looking at Pottery Barn Kids' chamois pad covers
__label__neg	 They are extrememly soft (you'll wish your sheets were made out of this stuff
__label__neg	), have the safety strap slits and fit the changing pad perfectly
__label__pos	I like that you can exchange the tips, and it comes with a handy fever reference guide
__label__neg	 The thermometer claims to take quick temp
__label__pos	 Worked perfect first time used
__label__neg	 After one use, it takes longer than the cheap therm got from the hospital
__label__neg	 So disappointed
__label__neg	I bought 4 of these bottles for my son I tried a couple of different bottles for my son
__label__neg	 I know not all kid's are the smae so your child might like them but I had to get rid of them
__label__neg	 My son took 45 min or more to drink 6 ounces out them when he only took about 20 min to drink out of the Avent stage one nipple even
__label__neg	 I also tried using these at a day care I worked at and other babies had the same problem the nipple on them is to firm so it takes longer for the baby to suck milk out and by the time they are done their jaw is tired
__label__neg	 If you like the nipple shape and design the playtex nurser works like a dream with the Multi Flow nipples
__label__neg	 Avent bottles are awsome too
__label__neg	"I agree with the previous review from ""Meesah"""
__label__neg	 My daughter just turned 4 months and she is 15 pounds already
__label__neg	if I hadn't returned this car seat when she was 8 weeks old,weighed 11
__label__neg	13 pounds & was 24 1/2 inches, she probably would be falling out of it by now
__label__neg	 I agree that the canopy does absolutely nothing to shield infants from the sun
__label__neg	 It is a joke
__label__neg	 My daughter seemed uncomfortable in this car seat from day one
__label__neg	 I decided to return this car seat and the Venezia stroller to BRU when my baby was 8 weeks old
__label__neg	best decision I made
__label__neg	 I also had several problems with the stroller
__label__neg	I was walking in the mall one afternoon and 2 screws just fell off
__label__neg	(this was one of many problems) I was horrified
__label__neg	 Luckily, I stopped to see what it was
__label__neg	 I almost kept walking assuming it was something that the wheels ran over
__label__neg	 Right at that moment I knew I had made a huge and very expensive mistake
__label__neg	because of all the issues, BRU accepted my return and we bought the Eddie Bauer system instead
__label__neg	 My husband and I are very happy with the safety and comfort features of the Eddie Bauer system
__label__neg	 Wish we bought that one from the start
__label__neg	 Money doesn't always buy quality
__label__neg	 We learned our lesson the hard way
__label__neg	 We are much happier now and our daughter is too
__label__neg	I tried the Dr
__label__neg	 Brown system but was unsatisfied for several reasons
__label__neg	 First of all, the bottles flowed too fast causing my son to choke and gag with every couple of swallows
__label__neg	 Not surprisingly, this led to terrible gas and spitting up every time we fed
__label__neg	Secondly, I think these bottles are overpriced
__label__neg	 Even if they had worked for me, I would have been hard pressed to spend all that extra money
__label__neg	 Bottle feeding is not rocket science and no mother should have to pay that much to feed her child successfully
__label__neg	Finally, although the wide-neck bottles may be a little easier to clean, they also come with more parts than standard bottles, so it all evens out anyway
__label__neg	 Additionally, I found the big Dr
__label__neg	 Brown's bottles (8-9 oz size) to be very cumbersome, especially when storing them in the fridge or in a diaper bag
__label__neg	Every baby is different and you've got to pick the system that works best for the both of you
__label__neg	 For our particular situation, Dr
__label__neg	 Brown's was not the answer
__label__neg	This thing would not stay suctioned to the table
__label__neg	 Period
__label__neg	 Took it back the very same day
__label__neg	I got this hamper as a gift
__label__neg	 I returned it the next day
__label__neg	 The white paint chips off all over
__label__neg	I got this from our registry and had to return it because there was not enough room for all the stuff that babies needs
__label__neg	 It also only has one compartment to fit one very small bottle
__label__neg	 This would be great for a quick outting to the super market but definitely not good for a long day out with the baby
__label__neg	 It also didn't feel as comfortable as what other reviewers wrote about
__label__neg	" I'm 5'4"" and about 125 pounds and it just kept slipping to the side and didn't hold still"
__label__neg	We recently bought this car seat without knowing that Graco car seats actually have 2 different kinds of methods of tightening the baby seat belt in the car seat
__label__neg	 We found that this particular colour that we bought Tango, you had to place the child in the seat, tilt the car seat forward, all the while making sure to hold the child in the seat so that he does not fall out, tighten the belt from the back of the car seat before the belt is tight enough to be used
__label__neg	 There is the other type of car seat where there is a strap at the bottom where you can simply just pull to tighten
__label__neg	 I do not know why Graco is still circulating car seats that has the extremely impractical and inconvenient model
__label__neg	 In the end we returned this seat to Amazon, and went to Babies R US to view the right model and bought from there
__label__neg	 We ended up paying a cheaper price as well
__label__neg	These were my second attempt to find a good sippy cup with a straw and I'm disappointed yet again
__label__neg	 I thought, based on the reviews, that these would be better than the other cups I'd tried - which had too many parts - but they really aren't
__label__neg	 Sure, there is one less piece to the straw, but you have to dismantle the flip top to get the straw apart (ultimately resulting in the same number of parts)
__label__neg	 And they are just as tricky to get apart
__label__neg	 They also hold less liquid than the others
__label__neg	 Finally, and MOST disappointing, these leaked more than the previous brand I tried - a lot more
__label__neg	 So, ultimately, I'm going to end up using these for water and buying more of the others for everything else
__label__neg	 Now I need to go ammend my other review
__label__neg	This is probably the worst product I have ever bought
__label__neg	With two children 16 months apart, I knew I'd need an installed gate for our ground floor
__label__pos	 Based on the ratings in Consumer Reports and the reviews on this website, I eagerly purchased two of these to keep the kids in our living room
__label__pos	The instructions were very clear and I was looking forward to installing the gates
__label__neg	 I figured it would take time but if I followed all the steps, it should be simple
__label__neg	 Nothing could've been further from the truth
__label__neg	We used the templates provided by The First Years and they were of no use
__label__neg	 I ended up drilling and re-drilling in all four walls
__label__neg	 One wall we had to replaster and I will have to repaint when I have the time
__label__neg	We had to make TWO trips to Home Depot to get replacement screws
__label__neg	 The heads of the screws provided in the box continued to break whether we used a power screwdriver or tried to install them by hand
__label__pos	 Fortunately, we never had a problem with the Home Depot screws
__label__neg	Please, I beg you not to waste your money on this product
__label__neg	I have clipped my child's little fingers more than his nails with these
__label__neg	 That guard is awful and makes it nearly impossible to see what you are doing
__label__neg	 Not to mention thiese clippers are sharp as can be
__label__neg	 I'm so paranoid about clipping his nails now because of these
__label__neg	I put the batteries in and nothing works
__label__neg	 No lights, no music, I could have just purchased a $1
__label__neg	99 drugstore mirror and mounted it on the headrest
__label__neg	 I'm especially irked because I live in the Middle East and paid all this money to have it shipped here and it doesn't even work
__label__neg	 What a waste of money
__label__neg	Please note that this actually isn't manufactured by Fisher Price; the name is licensed
__label__neg	 I actually called Fisher Price to tell them that this company, Blue Ridge, is giving Fisher Price a bad name
__label__neg	 I read the reviews on this and knew what I was getting myself into, but thought oh, since I generally have good luck with products, it'll be OK
__label__neg	 Actually, it's not OK
__label__neg	 I emailed Blue Ridge to tell them about this issue
__label__neg	 It seems as though the receiver on the mirror is defective
__label__neg	 We'll see what they have to say
__label__pos	These covers were the only ones that I could find that would fit my changing pad (LA Baby 4-sided changing pad)
__label__neg	 They are made with poor materials, are too thin, stain, and both of mine snagged on my wedding ring every time I would pick up the baby, so there would end up being long strands of terry cloth hanging off of them everywhere
__label__neg	 I cut one up and used it as a template to make my own changing pad covers out of old towels, that was the only good thing it did for me
__label__neg	My baby never wanted to take them, or when he did, he looked like he was going to choke (even with the newborn nipples
__label__neg	), and was doing a mess, with milk dripping everywhere
__label__neg	 The Evenflo nipples were cheaper and better
__label__pos	I bought the Lamaze Spin & Explore for my daughtet, when it got to my home I opened it and set it up which was really easy
__label__neg	 When it was all put together it didn't look like something I wanted to put my daughter on
__label__neg	 I was afraid it was going to tip over
__label__neg	 It didn't look like it would suppport her
__label__neg	 If she wasn't on it just right it looked like it would tip over
__label__neg	 I returned it
__label__neg	I bought this because it claimed to have 2 oz in each serving (I read that somewhere and it also said that on the box when it arrived)
__label__neg	 I measured and it only has one ounce per cube
__label__neg	 I vacuum pack the cubes the day after I freeze them so the lid does me no good
__label__neg	 I will return this and keep my cheap ice cube trays to use instead
__label__neg	 False advertising and a waste of my time
__label__neg	We returned this carrier
__label__neg	 The straps kept slipping when we put our son in it, for some reason, we could never get the settings right to get the strap to stop slipping
__label__neg	 Very irritating
__label__neg	 My son would get so frustrated that we just gave up and returned it
__label__neg	 We're going to get the Baby Bjorn instead upon recommendation from other parents
__label__neg	 This one is a decent price compared to others, but very uncomfortable so not worth it even if it is better priced
__label__neg	Piece of junk
__label__neg	 Very noisy
__label__neg	 Leg lifts off the ground when rocking
__label__neg	 All six speeds are exactly the same speed
__label__neg	 Poor quality
__label__neg	 It's going back
__label__neg	I don't like this basket
__label__neg	 It's so small
__label__neg	 and, yes, I realize it's only for baby-sized objects, but it's just proportioned wrong
__label__neg	 In my dishwasher, there really isn't a good place for this basket to fit, and, if I manage to get it in there, I can't fill it up with very many things to wash
__label__neg	I also have a microwave steam sterilizer
__label__neg	 I'd go with that instead of this basket
__label__neg	Also, when ordering this from Amazon, I didn't realize there are different color choices, so make sure you don't get a pink basket instead of the blue one you really wanted
__label__neg	I do not own this item but I tried it out in the store and it HURT my shoulder
__label__neg	 The shoulder strap is too narrow, it digs in, and I only had it on for a couple seconds
__label__neg	 I went with a New Native pouch and I LOVE it
__label__neg	This pump is terrible
__label__neg	 First of all it is loud
__label__neg	 Second of all it is not at all powerful
__label__neg	 It will NOT empty your breast
__label__neg	 I pumped & pumped & pumped & hardly got any milk
__label__neg	 The more I pumped the less milk I got out
__label__neg	 I was losing my milk supply fast
__label__neg	 I called my lactation consultant & she had me pumping every 15 minutes to regain my milk supply
__label__neg	 That didn't work this motor is not powerful enough
__label__neg	 I ended up having so much milk left in my breasts they got painfuly engorged & then resulted in getting Mastitis
__label__neg	 I eventually had to rent a hospital grade breast pump that worked
__label__neg	 Don't waste your money on this pump
__label__neg	 It looks great but I can't say anything else positive about it
__label__neg	 I gave it one star because that is the lowest you can give
__label__neg	 I really give it zero stars
__label__neg	 It is very expensive
__label__neg	 I suggest renting a hospital grade pump
__label__neg	 It is much cheaper & will definately work
__label__pos	This is by far one of the nicest LOOKING baby seats out there
__label__neg	 I received a barely-used one as a pass-along-gift from my girlfriend
__label__neg	 Now I now why it was barely-used
__label__neg	 Her son didn't like it
__label__neg	 Neither did mine
__label__neg	 I didn't get it-- it was warm, soft-- he didn't care and wanted nothing to do with it-- preferred this hideous baby seat every time
__label__neg	" The back is very flat- so I never felt like the baby was really ""in"" a seat, more like leaning on it"
__label__neg	 This may work for much smaller babies, but at 8 lbs
__label__neg	, my baby was done with it by week 3
__label__neg	My husband and I hated this diaper pail from the day we first began using it
__label__neg	 The cylinder continually got stuck, and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder
__label__neg	 It is no fun pulling apart a diaper pail at 2:00 in the morning because the handle won't go down due to a diaper that is stuck in it
__label__neg	 Plus, I think it is unsanitary
__label__neg	 The diapers are placed in a plastic hole at the top of the pail, and then they drop through to the bag
__label__neg	 Well, messy diapers sometimes left a bit of a mess in the opening area, and it was not easy to clean
__label__neg	 Finally, after two months of dealing with this pail, one morning, I flipped the handle, and the cylinder fell right into the bottom of the pail
__label__neg	 (It was not a pleasant task to retrieve it, either
__label__neg	) I haven't been able to figure out how to fix it, so we are using a Safety 1st Diaper Pail now, and the Diaper Champ will be hauled to the road for the trash pickup next week
__label__neg	 I think that for the price, it should have lasted longer than two months
__label__neg	 I do not recommend this product
__label__pos	This toy was just the cutest little thing, and I couldn't resist it
__label__neg	 It looks like it'd be so much fun, but my daughter doesn't seem to care for it at all
__label__neg	 I don't get it
__label__neg	 She had a tummy pillow and lots of toys to play with (and she does chew on the chewy toys), but even though it plays tunes, it just doesn't impress her very much
__label__neg	 Right now, this toy is in storage
__label__neg	 She has had this since she was about three months old, and now that she is nearly six, she still isn't too impressed with it
__label__neg	 I have some exotic pets, maybe I will let them play with it
__label__neg	 For our purposes, this toy was over-priced for the benefit I'd hoped to get out of it
__label__neg	I love the Advent line & highly recommend their bottles & microwave sterilizer, but this breast pump is awful
__label__neg	 The prong that connects to the handle, which creates the vacuum to pull the milk out, consistently becomes unlatched breaking the vacuum so you have to fix it and start all over
__label__pos	 The only reason it got a two stars rating was because the pump handle does fit extremely well on the bottles and everything fits in the bag nicely
__label__neg	I bought two of these undermats and wish I had not
__label__neg	 They do not &quot;grip&quot; our cars leather seats and cause the infant car seats to slide a bit
__label__neg	 We had our car seats inspected and the police officers doing the inspection said not to use these liners
__label__neg	 They advised us the us to use shelf liner
__label__neg	 I instead purchased the Prince Lionheart undermat that has the same sort of soft tacky feel as the recommened shelf liner
__label__neg	 It works the same and is more attractive
__label__pos	Initially, we fell in the camp of enthusiastic adorers of this toy
__label__pos	 Baby learned to pass it from hand to hand, retrieve it when lost and gaze intently into the friendly face
__label__neg	 Then he managed to stuff one of the long legs deep into his mouth and started to gag
__label__neg	 The legs are exactly the size that can block airways
__label__neg	 Since he was supervised, nothing bad happened, but babes at this age (4 months) don't have enough control to pull back the toy from their mouths when already scared by the gagging
__label__neg	 I don't think I'll try again at a later date -- even older babes are still too young to be trusted to react correctly when a leg goes too far in
__label__pos	This toy has many thoughtful features -- no-slip texture, right-size for hands, light weight, soft (no banging on heads), friendly face and an engaging presence
__label__neg	 But the legs can choke, which is why we've replaced it with a friendly velvet rocketship
__label__neg	Let me start by saying that we used Playtex Ventair bottles with my first child
__label__pos	 The bottles were great--durable and well-made
__label__pos	" We used them throughout her ""bottle-hood""--for over a year"
__label__pos	 No problems
__label__neg	However, we began using these again with our second child
__label__pos	 We were excited to hear that they were BPA-free and with our past experience with Playtex bottles, we were happy to purchase these
__label__neg	Within 3 weeks, the ink on the bottles came off of them
__label__neg	 So we had to use sharpie pens to mark the ounces
__label__neg	 And within 3 months, they began to leak
__label__neg	 We bought about 20 bottles
__label__neg	from a various number of stores
__label__neg	 So now we are stuck with 20 leaking bottles that require a sharpie every few weeks
__label__neg	 Perhaps it was because we washed them in the dishwasher
__label__neg	but really, the bottles should be prepared to handle that
__label__neg	Please don't waste your money on these bottles
__label__neg	 They appear great at first but go downhill quickly
__label__neg	Washed it once according to directions & it shrunk beyond belief
__label__neg	 Didn't even use it once
__label__neg	 Don't bother
__label__pos	We brought our baby home from the hospital yesterday and hooked up the monitors - they worked great
__label__neg	for 24 hours
__label__neg	 Now all we hear is static that only gives way to clicks and leaves us wondering which is more annoying
__label__neg	 To make things worse they worked fine yesterday so in my rush to clean up the house and be a good husband I threw away the box so now it looks like [$] wasted
__label__neg	 My wife has a hard enough time sleeping in between feedings without having to listen to static
__label__neg	 Don't waste your money - buy another one
__label__neg	I purchased this to give as a gift; Sadly, the box arrived dented, and now I can't use this item
__label__neg	 Disappointing
__label__neg	 This is just one of several packaging problems I've had with amazon over the last month (amazon has not been packaging my items carefully, leading to damaged items)
__label__neg	 Ugh
__label__pos	I was so excited to get this for my 1yo, and it is a great toy
__label__pos	 My 1yo & 3yo love it
__label__neg	 BUT it has an issue with batteries
__label__neg	" When it arrived (with included batteries in a ""try me"" box), the batteries were dead"
__label__neg	 It's not being played with at a rate that warrants having to change the batteries once or twice a week
__label__neg	 When it begins getting low on power, the music sounds warped, like an old warped record, which is dreadful
__label__neg	 Perhaps we got a defective one
__label__neg	 I don't know
__label__neg	 I hope this isn't happening to others
__label__neg	First of all, the item pictures shows twice as many as you really get
__label__neg	 you only get 8, i was expecting more
__label__neg	 they fit together in a very odd way, and young children will have a difficult time figuring out how exactly which part goes in which as well as actually pushing them together
__label__neg	 they're sturdy but the hard plastic is tough for even my 3 yr old to push together
__label__neg	 its really awkward
__label__neg	 these are nothing like the beads that are for regular play which are a harder plastic and its easy for a baby to figure out which part goes into which
__label__neg	also you have to worry about the black mold/mildew that collects when you have bath toys like this
__label__neg	 they cannot properly dry after use and this nasty stuff collects and there isn't any real good way of cleaning it out
__label__neg	Don't waste your money because you can't return this item
__label__neg	This so-called traveler toilet is not usable
__label__neg	 It is too small for the large typical public toilet
__label__neg	 It is flimsy and bends frighteningly underneath small children even if you push the traveler seat all the way back so it is supported underneath the back (as per the included instructions)
__label__neg	 It slips slips slips
__label__neg	 I can't think of a single use for it
__label__neg	 Even at grandma's house we would be better off just keeping a proper toilet seat there like the Baby BjornBABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer- White/ Black
__label__neg	We have had much better luck in public toilets using theKalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Blue
__label__neg	 The Kalencom is very sturdy and has good (but not perfect) non-slip grips
__label__neg	 It is not a perfect seat because it is not flat but our kids do not mind it a bit and we find it much easier to use
__label__neg	My baby is 4
__label__neg	5 months old, and 16 pounds, and the harness straps are extremely tight for her
__label__neg	 She is only 26 inches in length
__label__neg	 I don't think the harness has been designed well
__label__neg	 I called Graco and they said there is nothing they can do about it and that I will need to switch to a convertible car seat
__label__neg	 If you have an alternative, go with it
__label__neg	 I would not recommend this product to anyone
__label__neg	This very cute product is designed for only ONE style of bathtub spigot - the kind that has NO water diverter where the water flows out, and NO shower pull-up handle (look at the customer pictures to see the illustrations
__label__neg	) On top of that, this cover is too short for any of our spigots
__label__neg	One of our spigots has a diverter and when I tried this cover, the water sprays weakly from all sides of the mouth instead of flowing nicely towards the front
__label__neg	This cover won't slip onto our spigots that have a shower pull-up handle
__label__neg	 If your spigot has a flat-top shower pull-up or it can be unscrewed, then perhaps you can make this work
__label__neg	AND it's too short
__label__neg	 When the cover is on a spigot, the back of the cover won't meet the tile wall, which means it can't be caulked into place, which means it is easily bumped out of position, spewing water everywhere, or perhaps worse, falling off the spigot entirely
__label__neg	 No good
__label__neg	This product should have been designed to accommodate more styles of spigots
__label__neg	I pressed and clicked the correct spot like it said in the directions and yet it still leaks
__label__neg	 This was a problem because i used it on the kitchen counters for the first week
__label__neg	 I had to put towels under it to absorb all the water
__label__neg	 So i moved it upstairs to the bathtub and this way i don't have to worry about all the leaks
__label__neg	 Really, who wants a tub that leaks
__label__neg	 My daughter is not yet sitting up on her own and yet she is too long to be reclined comfortably in this tub
__label__neg	so we are in an awkward transition phase
__label__neg	 a phase that this tub doesn't suitably deal with
__label__neg	 I wouldn't buy this tub
__label__pos	When cosleeping with an infant, this adds and extra sense of security
__label__neg	 The top half of the sleeper is great, formed out of a rigid plastic tray, but the bottom half is just the this foam mattress with no support underneath
__label__neg	 Because of this, it tends to cause a downhill slope, and baby slides down
__label__neg	We gave up on using this within a week, and just put him in bed with us until we could buy an Arms Reach Mini Cosleeper
__label__neg	The Close and Secure Sleeper might be helpful when used in a crib and when travelling, but it has limited value in an adult bed, or at least it did for us
__label__neg	I love this bottle brush, because it is so convenient to have the two brushes in one, and unlike the Munchkin bottle brush it doesn't swivel (the swiveling makes it impossible to get the brush on the sides of the bottle, pump horns, etc) but this brush broke after only 8 weeks of use
__label__neg	 The brush literally came out of the handle
__label__neg	 I almost considered buying another, but at $15 (that's with shipping) it's too much money for something that isn't going to last long
__label__pos	I must admit that my daughter enjoyed looking at this mobile for the first couple months of her life
__label__neg	 My complaint is that the product is flimsy for the price
__label__neg	 The holes punched in the cards were so small that when hooked onto the arms of the mobile they cracked (many arrived already cracked)
__label__neg	 The arms and cards tend to fall off if accidentally touched even slightly
__label__neg	 And the cards are somewhat translucent so you can see the image on the reverse as well
__label__neg	Used this on our crib; lasted MAYBE 2 months
__label__neg	 It yellowed, pulled off, and stripped the paint off the crib too
__label__neg	 DO NOT waste your time or money with this product
__label__neg	The gate does not swing back, does not close by itself and only the bottom lock works
__label__neg	They are so thin and cheap
__label__neg	 They bend up the matteress so bad I can't even use them
__label__neg	 I would have returned them but I washed them before I put them on the bassinet
__label__neg	These bags are very, very thin
__label__neg	 They can't block the diaper smell, so instead the company tried to cover up the diaper smell with a scent that is so strong I can't stand to leave the box open
__label__neg	 The diaper smell eventually overpowers the scent because the bags are sooooo thin
__label__neg	In addition, the way the bags are placed in the box they don't pop up as you pull one out, so I'm always struggling to get another bag out as I'm handling a dirty diaper
__label__neg	For this product to really work well, the bags need to be much thicker so that the diaper smell is blocked NOT masked
__label__pos	The one nice thing about this product is the handle ties
__label__pos	 They are easy to use
__label__neg	The only word that comes to mind to describe this bottle is garbage
__label__neg	 It leaks and is cheaply made
__label__neg	 I'm a nurse and used to working with all types of equipment and I know junk when I see it
__label__neg	 All babies get gas, all babies need to burp
__label__neg	 The bottom line is the basic 99 cent bottle at your local supermarket will do the job
__label__pos	This toy appeals to parents because the music isn't obnoxious, its marketing promises a brilliant (bilingual) baby, and it isn't very expensive
__label__neg	 The reality is there are so many switches, settings, and keys on this thing that it's all but impossible for your child to learn cause and effect
__label__neg	 My son seemed interested in the toy, but grew frustrated after a while because the effect of hitting the red key with the setting on Spanish with one knob turned to the picture of the metronome with the other knob turned to the picture of the violin was completely different from the day before when he hit the red key with the setting on French with one knob turned to the picture of the keyboard and the other knob set to the picture of the clarinet
__label__neg	My mother gave this toy to my son envisioning a valedictorian or the reincarnation of Beethoven
__label__neg	 I ended up lying to her, telling her the toy was great, and sending it to the thrift store
__label__neg	 If you want your toddler or baby to learn about music and cause and effect, simply put them in front of a keyboard or piano
__label__neg	 Overall, we've found that while they have a great marketing campaign, Baby Einstein makes pretty poorly designed baby toys
__label__neg	Our daughter, now 7 weeks old, has yet to warm up to this swing
__label__neg	 There isn't anything fundamentally wrong with the swing; it is what it is
__label__neg	 Our daughter just doesn't like it
__label__neg	 The motor isn't particularly powerful, the music isn't very soothing, and I don't think she feels secure being so close to the floor
__label__neg	After reading reviews we bought this thinking it would be more economical, since you don't need the special bags
__label__neg	 It's so not worth it
__label__neg	 Everytime you flip the lid it pushes this horrible smell into the room
__label__neg	 I've tried baking soda, bleach, dryer sheets, vinegar-you name it, we tried it
__label__neg	 And the residual smell of past diapers is still in there, nothing makes it go away
__label__neg	 It still stinks
__label__neg	 And now that my daughter is walking she flips the drum back and forth, you have to leave the room
__label__neg	 We're switching to the diaper dekor, it actually works
__label__pos	I bought this because it looked like a more comfortable version of the tub sponge that my mom recommended
__label__neg	 It does elevate the baby more than the yellow sponge, but I had a few things I didn't like about it
__label__neg	 First, it is very hard to lift to wring out after the bath
__label__neg	 The water it soaks up makes it very heavy
__label__neg	 Second, if you don't have all of the water wrung out of it, and don't completely submerge it into the warm water at the next bath, when the baby lays on it some of the cold water comes out and makes the baby cold
__label__neg	 For the longest time I couldn't figure out why my son screamed every time I laid him on the Safer Bather, and then one day I felt the cold water coming up out of it as I was bathing him
__label__neg	 I switched to the Sure Comfort newborn to toddler tub and he likes it so much better
__label__neg	 He prefers to be IN the warm water rather than on top of it
__label__neg	We bought this to see the baby in the rear view mirror
__label__neg	 This mirror was a big disappointment because it was totally useless for that purpose
__label__neg	 It was really really difficult to attach the mirror - there was absolutely no place to attach it in order to see the baby
__label__pos	 Instead, it is kind of useful as a mirror to entertain the baby in the car
__label__neg	 BUt I wouldn't spend $20 on a mirror for that purpose
__label__neg	 I guess the music is ok, but we can easily use a CD with better music for those purposes
__label__neg	we buy a lot of stuff on amazon, and frankly I am really disappointed with the quality of this unit
__label__neg	 don't let it fool you, the sides and back are cheap particle board
__label__neg	 The rest of the frame is pine
__label__neg	 the drawers are really cheap balsa wood too
__label__neg	 For nursey furniture, stick with your local dealer
__label__neg	 We assembled this one fine and it works ok, but I am worried it is going to fall apart every time we use it
__label__neg	 would not get this one again
__label__neg	This was one baby gift I wish we would've returned before using - a recieving blanket works much better. 
__label__neu	I recommend waiting to see if your little one wiggles out of the blanket and needs this before buying.
__label__neg	I found it easy to use and it sticks to the bathtub great, BUT my two month old is constantly slipping down and I have to keep pulling him back up onto the hammock. 
__label__neu	 I would buy one that is built with a slanted back and a short basin so baby doesn't have far to slide down. 
__label__neu	 Maybe it will be more helpful as he is older and we don't need the hammock.
__label__neg	This was terrible. 
__label__neg	It leaked all over the place. 
__label__neu	Finally my husband put silicone all around it which helped. 
__label__neg	Save your money & buy the cheap $10 one that's one piece.
__label__neg	This thing is very hard to figure out. 
__label__neg	One setting gets the bottle too hot too fast, try another setting for 15 min's and you still have cold milk! 
__label__neu	I tried to use it for 3 months... 
__label__neg	finally gave up. 
__label__neg	Save the money. 
__label__neu	Warm water in the microwave and stick the bottle in that... 
__label__neu	Sometimes we need to listen to our mom's and grandma's - they didnt have these and we turned out fine!
__label__neu	i had these and i tried it b/c my son wouldn't take the bottle after i breastfed for a month... 
__label__neg	not only he didn't like it, it also leaks like crazy. 
__label__neg	 it flowed too slow for him. 
__label__neu	 maybe this would work for newborns but not when they're a bit older. 
__label__neg	 there's only one hole and he got frustrated sucking so hard. 
__label__neg	 and did i mention it leaks and wasted my milk. 
__label__neg	the plastic feels cheap too. 
__label__pos	 i went back to avent and he did fine switching back and forth.
__label__pos	This is a great concept, but... 
__label__neg	My son was squirmy enough from the beginning that he managed to slither out of this after a week or two. 
__label__neg	 He would be half out of the top after an hour or so. 
__label__neg	 It just didn't keep him in place and I was afraid with him moving around so much anyway, it may actually be dangerous. 
__label__neg	Also, (he was a June baby) the polyester type material made him very sweaty, which contributed further to multiple nightime awakenings. 
__label__neg	 I kept thinking he had leaked out of his diaper before I realized his sides were sweaty from this product.
__label__neg	I was excited when my husband brought it home since I had read some good reviews, however after placing my son in it his chin was on his chest and not comfortable for him at all. 
__label__neg	Also the material was  in his face. 
__label__neu	I followed directions and thought I had it right, mabye they should send out someone to show me how it works. 
__label__neu	I gave it a 2 since it is stylish & I hope it works in a few weeks when my son can hold his head up and he can sit in it...we'll see. 
__label__neg	Wish I had saved my receipt!
__label__pos	My son loved this toy on his carrier. 
__label__neg	But, one week after we attached it to the car seat, it started leaking! 
__label__neu	I was so disappointed because my son really like the music, and especially pushing the beads back and fourth, and making them rattle. 
__label__neu	I also found myself constantly attaching it and removing it to be able to get him in and out of the carrier. 
__label__neg	While it was at a fine height with the carrier handle raised, it hit him in the face when the handle was moved back so that he could be put in or taken out of the seat. 
__label__neg	A really disappointing product from Baby Einstein. 
__label__pos	We love and own many of their other items.
__label__neu	I bought this for my son about 7 months ago and he did like it at first but it should be made a little bigger. 
__label__neg	It hurts his legs when using the deflector part and you have to use that part with a boy. 
__label__neg	Maybe this potty is better for a girl but definately not a boy. 
__label__neg	Also it is hard to clean with too many cracks and sometimes it leaks. 
__label__neu	The only part me and my son liked was he liked to pull the container out by himself and empty it thats why i gave it the 2 stars i did. 
__label__neg	I never even used the music part of it so i cannot review that but i think that it is useless. 
__label__neu	I have decided just to buy a soft kids seat for the big toilet and a step stool. 
__label__neg	I would not buy this potty again. 
__label__neg	I would recommend you research other pottys on the market because this is no good. 
__label__neu	If fisher price improved this potty by making it a little bigger for boys and improved some other things, then it probably would be the best potty.
__label__neg	This valve did not work on my medela breast pump (i have the dual pump). 
__label__neg	 i didn't return it because i was going to have to buy as much for the shipping as i did for the pump. 
__label__neg	 don't buy here. 
__label__neu	 just go to a brick and mortar store (like target) to purchase. 
__label__neu	 it's not amazon's fault... 
__label__neu	it's the supplier's issue.
__label__neg	I bought this to use with my Avent bottles (which by the way LEAK) and I was very disappointed. 
__label__neu	My doctor told me to pump to stimulate my milk production which was coming in slowly. 
__label__neg	I could not get very much with this and needless to say it was not helping. 
__label__pos	Once I started using a Medela Electric pump, I got tons of milk! 
__label__pos	I was skeptical about the price, but it's totally worth it if you want to be able to use a pump on a regular basis.
__label__neg	I bought this tub for my friend and she said it was a terrible product. 
__label__neg	 The sling was poorly made and the sprayer broke after 5 uses. 
__label__neu	 She told me she should have listened to me and just used the kitchen sink w/ the sprayer. 
__label__neu	At least that doesn't break.
__label__neu	We have had the original Co-Sleeper for 2.5 years. 
__label__neg	 Our first son slept in it for 2 months and then refused to sleep in it. 
__label__neg	 Our second refused to sleep in it period (even padding it with a small quilt). 
__label__neg	 I assume that they make it completely uncomfortable to help prevent SIDS (your baby might has well be laying on the floor because it is not padded very well at all). 
__label__neg	 The fitted sheet cannot be dried in the dryer, which is inconvenient. 
__label__neg	 Most of all, I hate assembling and disassembling this thing. 
__label__neg	 I never complain about assembling toys, gadgets, playards, etc...but this thing is horrible. 
__label__neg	 I actually beat it with a hammer when I took it down after my first child quit using it. 
__label__neg	 It is now put away and I will never put it up again. 
__label__pos	 The only good thing I will say about it is that it's extremely sturdy (probably why it's a pain to assemble). 
__label__neu	 I would suggest scouting ebay, yard sales, and second-hand stores instead of buying a new one. 
__label__neg	 It is not worth $200.
__label__neg	I hate this monitor. 
__label__neg	It is 20 feet from my child's room yet it constantly beeps that it is out of range. 
__label__neg	The beep is so loud and annoying and it's allllll night long. 
__label__neu	I've tried plugging both parts into to other outlets but have had no luck. 
__label__neu	There must be something in our house or neighborhood that causes interference.
__label__neg	We bought this several times at a baby store and had to toss them all out. 
__label__neg	It didn't stick and would pop up in spots after a while, even though we followed the directions each time...
__label__neg	These are still hard and also hard to store. 
__label__pos	 I found the DEX bibs to be much better.
__label__neg	Don't bother with these. 
__label__neg	 They are expensive for only 4 bottles and totally unnecessary. 
__label__pos	 It is much easier to buy storage bags. 
__label__neu	 If you are pumping full time, you will be storing alot more than 4 bottles at a time. 
__label__neg	I also found that I did not like these bottles for feeding because they do nothing to prevent air from entering baby's belly and the result is gas or worse, colic. 
__label__neg	They also flow too fast for newborns.
__label__neg	Just so you know, this product does not work with the hygeia pump. 
__label__neg	 I know there are not many hygeia pumpers out there but just in case, save yourself the time and the money and don't buy it as it does not convert for the hygeia threading. 
__label__neu	 The packaging does not indicate that it will work, it does not list Hygeia at all.
__label__neg	Wayyyy over priced! 
__label__neu	 Should have just used a cloth diaper tucked in. 
__label__neg	 Material is kinda rough. 
__label__neg	 Small and skimpy. 
__label__pos	 But does do the job. 
__label__neg	 Wouldn't purchase again. 
__label__neg	 Two does come in a pack, but for $16 it should be 6!
__label__neu	So we have been using this potty seat for several months now trying to get our daughter used to going on the potty. 
__label__pos	 I bought this one because it had great reviews and was simple and easy to clean. 
__label__neg	 But every time we put her on it, after only a few minutes she starts complaining that her feet hurt.
