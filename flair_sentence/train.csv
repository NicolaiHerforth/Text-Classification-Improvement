__label__pos	I own two of these mattress pads and I love them.
__label__neu	I had to make it a little bigger,  which of course makes it leak (more) and even then,  my then 9 month old tossed it onto the floor.
__label__neu	I can see though how it is very possible for fraying to occur but I think as long as you inspect it with each use and make sure it is secure you will be fine.
__label__pos	"""The loops also let you change the toys frequently to prevent boredom."""
__label__neg	 Stuck with a child unit, and figuring it was just one of those things, we decided to buy a replacement pair, and just have an extra child unit we could swap in and out as a replacement
__label__neg	"""However, I refused to take it with me traveling."""
__label__neg	 She had a tummy pillow and lots of toys to play with (and she does chew on the chewy toys), but even though it plays tunes, it just doesn't impress her very much
__label__neg	The entire purpose was to have a surface to place toys and other things on, but when the tray keeps falling off, you may as well just place your items in baby's lap.
__label__neu	The concept is good,  but execution is terrible.
__label__neu	So I hope you find my review just as helpful when deciding on your purchase.
__label__pos	Unfortunately this lead to a period when my son felt it was customary to lick things before putting them on the table, but this passed quickly.
__label__neu	The carrying case, case for traveling with milk and bottles, and case for the parts.
__label__pos	I got just as much milk with this pump as I did the hospital pump.
__label__neg	The one thing that I didn't like about the Dr. Brown's bottles I originally had was all of the different parts.
__label__neg	 My son has virtually ignored this toy since day 1
__label__neu	I was very disappointed in this product.
__label__pos	I love this sterlizer. 
__label__pos	Our baby has really liked this bath.
__label__pos	One very cool feature is that all that extra stuff turns off by itself in about 10 minutes.
__label__neu	"""My son is 10 months old and we just recieved this item as a gift from a friend."""
__label__neg	The only thing I don't like about this kit is that there really isn't a handle to hold it with and it is kind of bulky but other than that its great.
__label__neu	"""This is with three different people putting them on."""
__label__pos	I am so glad I registered for the Baby Bjorn carrier.
__label__neu	The only thing is, the small one I Had was in fleece, and my baby is a warm baby so he would get hot.
__label__pos	These bottles are a true must have!
__label__neu	(For those that missed the news reports - BPA is a chemical found in some plastics that a recent National Institutes of Health report indicated may be harmful,  especially to infants.)
__label__neu	Being in the baby business they should know that not all crib's are made the same
__label__neg	I took it to my lactation consultant and she said that she hates that brand/model and that she had 5 other mothers have the same complaints about it.
__label__pos	"""It saved me alot of space."""
__label__neg	I thankfully tested this product with my 9 month old BEFORE putting food in it and he was able to lift up the bowl within a minute.
__label__pos	My son can pick it up and move it around with one hand, so it isn't too heavy, which is definitely a bonus.
__label__neu	 I like the one by Munchkin
__label__neg	I'm surprised this potty got such rave reviews
__label__neu	He first giggled when grandpa talked to him and I've made him laugh a couple of times.  
__label__pos	Can say enough good things about this.
__label__neg	I foolishly bought this, knowing that others thought it was too low...but it really is SO LOW you can't hear it 4 feet away. 
__label__pos	She also likes to wear it around the house when it is cold,  cuddled up on the couch
__label__neu	It's very soft-- although as another reviewer stated we have taken to putting a receiving blanket on the top so it's easier to wash!
__label__pos	"""Great for one feeding!"""
__label__neu	1) Lightweight diapers don't actually fall through hole
__label__pos	"""My daughter likes her froggy..."""
__label__neg	In order to snap the tray down, I have to bend it a bit.
__label__neu	With two dogs in the house, we worried that the diaper can would become a hunting ground, but they haven't shown the least bit of interest.  
__label__neg	 Please listen to all the negative results on this one & don't buy it.
__label__neg	Too big to fit in average size diaper bag
__label__neu	My daughter is 6 weeks old so I cannot comment about the use of the tub for an older baby.
__label__pos	We live in the north east so it is a life saver.
__label__neu	We used the hammock at first (BE SURE NOT TO GET IT WET BEFORE PUTTING YOUR BABY IN IT BECAUSE IT GETS SUPER COLD)It was great because it supported her but her little bottom and back was in the warm water.
__label__pos	I liked it so much I just purchased one for my friend's baby
__label__neg	 I went and bought about 10 from Babies R Us, and after 2 weeks, 8 of the slow-flow nipples didn't work. 
__label__neg	 I think it's meant for playpen playtime not bath time
__label__pos	and lots for a baby to do.  
__label__neg	 My little girl hated it
__label__neu	Maybe I'm just used to the electric variety. 
__label__neu	I guess you can't have it all
__label__neg	Its major drawback are.
__label__neu	Works but...
__label__pos	It is so clear I can hear my husband talking from a few rooms away.
__label__neu	 My daughter who was 8 pounds 11 ounces at birth would slide down the Inclined to Sleep positioner
__label__neg	I purchased two,  and both have a radius of about 3 feet.
__label__neu	It helps to rearrange everything often.
__label__neu	Basically, anywhere a sippy cup will be tossed.  
__label__neg	There are two sound settings on the little learning table - one is way too loud (could easily damage your babies ears) and the other setting is way too low (can't hear it at all).
__label__neg	Neither my husband or I could get the tops off... 
__label__pos	I love that there are slow flow, medium, fast and then sippy tops.
__label__neg	Would not buy again.
__label__neg	Unfortunately, it doesn't hold any water to submerge anything than perhaps the feet.
__label__neu	My daughter can very easily get her hand into the cup and get cherrios out. 
__label__neg	For an infant the inward facing position of the Bjorn is also more protective from strangers and germs.
__label__neg	(especially given that the baby can slide down the incline and get there nose/mouth covered by the soft side cushions.
__label__neg	Seriously.
__label__neg	Con: I wished the front panel was expandable.
__label__pos	 But to each his own, I guess, a lot of people love it. 
__label__neg	 I am always bumping it on things and it falls off... 
__label__pos	There were problems with all the other bottles....such as leaking, having to buy liners all the time, unmarked nipples, suction, etc.
__label__pos	I can already tell that it will serve it's purpose perfectly!
__label__neu	It doesnt work.
__label__neu	I never wanted a tub because I was not impressed with anything I found but my sister got me this as a shower gift.
__label__neu	We plan to buy the larger bottles when he gets older and I might change my opinion then based on what I'm seeing in the reviews about the nipples that allow more flow.
__label__neu	We placed the little dear down into the seat and he immediately began pounding and pulling all the objects within range.
__label__neu	 You'll see that I am right
__label__neu	) busy. 
__label__neu	I have a Sony DVD player that is 1.
__label__neu	He rolls all over the crib during the night and the sleep sack moves with him.
__label__pos	She tried very hard at first and now actually kind of likes it.
__label__neu	I was looking for an easier baby sling (currently use the Moby) and thought this would be a good option.
__label__neg	 Also it would leak in the diaper bag as well. 
__label__neu	My husband and I bought this for our little girl's nursery.
__label__neu	As he got older, he'd start to teeth on the dangling things, then he eventually would sit under it, still playing, and he's 12 months now, so it's disassembled (it takes up a lot of space), but he still plays with all the toys and links it came with.
__label__neg	 if you want to use it as a booster when needed it's very clumsy, spring loaded, breakable (cheap plastic breaks) and it's too much of a pain to put under the chair and take away. 
__label__neu	We purchased this and the wind/rain screen.
__label__neg	Though he's only 11 lbs, my shoulders ache after having him in it for only minutes--I guess the straps are not padded enough.
__label__pos	The wide neck, 8 ounce bottles are perfect. 
__label__neg	The doors keep falling off, it fills up fast. 
__label__neu	Because it only happens to one in about four or five reviewers,  I think there must be a problem with production.
__label__pos	This swing has been fabulous.
__label__pos	They do keep him from turning on the stove so they do what their suppose to
__label__neg	 They come with slip covers now, but if you ever need to wash the pillow itself, it screws up the distribution of the stuffing. 
__label__neu	Occasionally he'll hold them in his hands and shake them-esp the one with little colored pebbles inside the plastic
__label__neu	5 stars! 
__label__neg	 I leaked through and around the pad
__label__pos	the hamock is wonderful and i use it more than just the tub.  
__label__pos	It's very durable and easy to clean.
__label__neu	Once,  when pushing down while grinding,  the whole thing slipped and tipped over.
__label__neg	" If I position her in the correct position, a mess is avoided, but she can't find that ""perfect position"" by herself"
__label__neu	My son did like to look at them.
__label__neg	 It will NOT empty your breast
__label__pos	"""This is a great bath toy organizer."""
__label__neu	"""Our daughter has severe acid reflux that has been treated with medication since she was a month old."""
__label__neg	I highly recommend you avoid this item
__label__pos	A must have
__label__neu	You can't 'see' this product's actual size by just looking at a photo. 
__label__pos	The soothing music and sounds are very pleasant and my son likes to look at himself in the mirrored part.
__label__neg	The other thing that drives me nuts is that the first few diapers I put in after a refill change never go in correctly.
__label__pos	 My tot liked opening the lid and would not get hurt running into it
__label__neg	 Furthermore, it did not supply enough back support so I prefered to use a heatable neck pillow to support my back. 
__label__pos	I highly recommend it.
__label__neu	In case of an accident or a problem with the car seat,  using any additional product (such as this mat or an attached fleece covering) may void the warranty of your car seat!
__label__pos	I loved these bottles for the first month I had my daughter. 
__label__pos	Overall this was the best looking swing I could find.  
__label__neg	"""Yes, it is beautiful, but I guess I wouldn't pay so much for something which will be outgrown so fast."""
__label__pos	You are not wasting your money!
__label__neg	 BUT...the elbow pad is a joke! 
__label__neg	I am over these bottles
__label__neu	He is wearing 12-18 month clothes at 8 months old. 
__label__pos	But those are insignificant and not problems compared to how many hours she has played with it and believe it or not her activity on the playmat has tired her out so that she finally slept through the night!
__label__neg	it's like it is tangling my fingers when i press to spray, too difficult to hold, should've made it bigger.i think i will return this item because i can't really give her a bath in this tub.
__label__neu	"""Learn from me!"""
__label__neg	 Also, as another reviewer stated, the chest strap was right under his chin, which I feared would decapitate him in an accident. 
__label__pos	So if you want pretty instead of quality
__label__neg	This seems like a messy or unsanitary way to have to do every time you make and pour a bottle.
__label__neu	"I ended up leaving it at my mom's for a ""back up"
__label__pos	"""It's great for traveling."""
__label__pos	It helped my colicky baby sleep much better!
__label__neu	HOWEVER, it didn't make a difference in the amount of hours he slept.
__label__pos	GREAT FOR TODDLERS AND EVEN PRESCHOOLER
__label__neg	The stitching on the liner on the inside that seperates compartments came undone after less than a year and is flimsy.
__label__neu	Great.
__label__neu	I have read the directions and everything but the water just leaks out.
__label__pos	It's made of steel and is very heavy,  but we'll install it once and then be happy our little guy is safe.
__label__neg	And after trying all the suggestions to prevent and stop leaking to no avail, I'm giving up.
__label__pos	Works GREAT.
__label__pos	"""They seem like they wouldn't be very sturdy/stable, but once the co-sleeper is strapped to the bed, it doesn't move at all."""
__label__neg	How annoying
__label__pos	This is something I will buy as a gift for friends.
__label__pos	My son has some crazy strong legs, and I absolutely credit this toy for helping him achieve that! 
__label__pos	She shakes them and giggles and smiles when different soothing and peaceful music sounds comes out.
__label__neu	I was attracted to the idea of having a bottle warmer that doesn't require electricity or a car adapter.
__label__neu	I bought this as a 2 pack with a coupon and got it for free,  but it is not even worth it for free.
__label__neu	 We purchased the first swing in December 06
__label__neu	"""I always placed her feet on the crackly leaf."""
__label__neg	"""I am overall very disappointed with the wear..."""
__label__pos	"""My son has loved this bouncer since he was just a couple of weeks old."""
__label__pos	We had other, more conventional monitors, but as my son co-sleeps with us, we wanted to be able to keep an eye on him if we couldn't be in the room with him, as he falls asleep before us.
__label__neg	 The directions tell you to drain them after each use but I can never get all the water out
__label__neu	 Well our third is now crawling and we just put it up again. 
__label__neu	the plastic on the top of this snack catcher is not good quality.
__label__neu	"""You're not supposed to keep your baby in a snowsuit while it's in a car seat because it interferes with the tightening of the harness straps."""
__label__pos	I've now decided to try the Nuby ones as they seem more sturdy for the spout overall and you can buy replacement spouts - a lot less cost and waste.
__label__neg	I would just use a large flannel blanket or something else, this isn't worth the money. 
__label__neg	We bought this to see the baby in the rear view mirror
__label__neu	I bought this stroller for my twin girls.  
__label__neg	I took us 6 minutes to heat up a bottle that we had in the fridge.
__label__neu	In addition, the alternative with such youngsters (when they are too young to fully have impulse control) is to secure them in a stroller, carrier or backpack.
__label__neg	I would not trust it at all.
__label__neg	I got this as a shower gift and returned it
__label__pos	"""A great stroller for the price - everyone should have one."""
__label__neg	I have to agree with others, it isn't very strong
__label__neu	I'm an exclusive pumper, so in addition to bottles and nipples, I also have lots of pump parts to deal with. 
__label__neu	It's pretty and probably would be good for that, but fails as a under table mat to keep things clean.
__label__neu	Only glass bottles are safer but they do not reduce colic
__label__neg	The problem with a breastfeeding mom is,  they do not fit standard US breast pumps
__label__neg	"""That is so funny that a previous reviewer called this the Pooperoo because my daughter poops almost everytime I put her in it!"""
__label__neu	This is total different
__label__neg	We'll give up eating out for two months to get non-interrupted sleep.
__label__neu	My Brest Friend Pillow, SunburstNice flat top, a firmer pillow, and a velcro belt to keep the pillow in place.  
__label__neg	 My son would get so frustrated that we just gave up and returned it
__label__neg	When my baby was under 4 months old he hated the Ergo.
__label__pos	My son always slept like a log in this thing and loved to just sit in it and be talked to!
__label__neg	If you are like me and need the white noise to keep your baby from waking up from other sounds in the house,  you need something a lot louder
__label__neg	I don't think I would use rear facing just because it doesn't have a removable base, so you would have to remove infant from seat to take in and out of home, store, ect.
__label__pos	"""To be honest, we loved our infantino soft carrier."""
__label__pos	"""My daughter just love it."""
__label__neu	All other baby gates become useless as soon as the kids figure out how it works.3.
__label__neu	I have this on the cabinets in my kitchen, on the ones that are on the bottom.
__label__pos	It does not make any noise if set up right.
__label__pos	Does exactly what we want it to do.
__label__pos	"""Eating at home and at restaurants is now a much less messy affair."""
__label__neg	 Never used it since
__label__neu	Disappointing.
__label__pos	I used the playtex nurser bottle and she loved it
__label__neg	Now I know that is the batteries,b/c they were a lesser breand then I usually buy, but it just shows how much battery power that it takes.
__label__neg	 Like other Avent products, the manual relies on pictures that can be difficult to interpret
__label__neg	Try to look for a monitor with a longer battery life.
__label__neu	I estimate it holds up to 16 soiled diapers (we put the dirty wipes inside the dirty diaper so they are bulky).
__label__neu	Perhaps mine was just defective.
__label__neu	"""We bought a Britax and an Evenflo."""
__label__neg	They are very thick, you can see them through clothing, the diameter is far too small so even a small shift and they will leak. 
__label__neu	The audio gives a constant hiss,  even when there is no sound in the room where the camera is,  and when the monitor is set to the lowest volume possible.
__label__neu	In fact,  she's pretty much left it alone since we took this off
__label__pos	And it is wonderful when baby is three months or so and wants to be propped up a bit to see that ever-expanding world.
__label__neg	They leaked standing upright or laying down.
__label__neg	Beware of the nipple not tightening properly when you screw it on.
__label__neg	Who wants to mess with that in the middle of the night
__label__neu	I bought this hoping it would help me organise all my baby diapering needs. 
__label__neg	"The back bends like a letter C and our son who is not even 6 months yet was so uncomfortable that I had to buy another stroller ""Peg Perego Aria"" and am so glad I did because it is much lighter than chicco and much sturdier."
__label__neg	When the top rack falls you pick it up to reposition it and the small plastic things at the top fall everywhere, so you have to remove those before repositioning the rack.
__label__pos	"""Marking and installing the discs took less than five minutes, and this time around, installation was a snap."""
__label__pos	"""This will definatly be my gift of choice from now on to all my pregnant friends."""
__label__neg	 Don't waste your money on these cups
__label__neg	Its reception is HORRIBLE!
__label__pos	For what I paid I am satisfied with this little hamper.  
__label__neg	I have a standard 28x52 crib and this was too big for it--it bunched and wouldn't lay flat.
__label__neu	It does very small amounts of food easily so the baby just gets a little of whatever we're having - beets sweet potatoes peaches whatever.
__label__pos	This seat is great!
__label__neg	"""Also, infants really don't ""travel"" much for this to be useful, as it's only supposed to be used in strollers, car-seats, bouncers, etc."""
__label__neg	 Also, I assume that the music cycles through all 5 tunes that are mentioned on the package
__label__pos	Excellent product!!
__label__neu	But for us 2 months of sleep has been worth the investment already even if it tanks later
__label__pos	:) It never seemed to bother her, but we decided to stuff one of her blankets or a towel in front of her to fill the gap in the seat area so that her hands couldn't fall through anymore.I have a picture posted to illustrate what I am talking about.Despite this issue, I would buy this toy again without a second thought.
__label__neg	To much chemicals
__label__neu	and I thought we just had to wait it out until he was four months and they say fussy babies mellow.
__label__neu	I will add that I shared my sentiments with Safety 1st and they did contact me to try to resolve my dissatisfaction
__label__neg	My 10 pound baby bounced more than could be safe & gradually sagged lower and lower requiring constant tightening.
__label__neu	The music is annoying so leaving it on after the baby has gone to sleep can drive you nuts.
__label__neg	 In February the motor went out and we had to get another one
__label__pos	You can pump and rock your baby at the same time.
__label__neg	I was very very leery of jumpers.
__label__neu	3.  
__label__neg	"""I returned the headrest that I received at my baby shower."""
__label__neu	and a regular body pillow.
__label__neg	When I place my daughter on it she manages to slip down the angled pillow, so when I go in to check on her she is scrunched up at the bottom of it.
__label__neg	It also developed some brown crusty looking stuff in the bottom of it and all the numbers rubbed off the measuring tube.
__label__neu	You're better off using plain ole tupperware when toting around food.
__label__pos	Having the spoon right there was great too.
__label__neg	It is one of my least favorite sippy cups
__label__pos	The nipple on this bottle is so real and is the only one my boy will use.
__label__pos	This toy is one of our five month old daughter's favorites!  
__label__pos	"I think he loved it because it was cozy and kept him in a ""tight"" environmentit's elevated slightly so your baby isn't lying on their back and just staring at the ceilinggreat for transferring a sleeping baby"
__label__pos	It will also be great for our upcoming car trip.
__label__pos	"""It is VERY roomy & baby enjoys splashing around."""
__label__pos	"""I'm not a fan of fisher-price in general due to the fact that they are not the most conscientious company, but this swing is great!"""
__label__neg	Bottom line -- waste of money.
__label__pos	If you want a good, basic, entertaining, educational (and I might even venture old-fashioned in some ways) toy, you should definitely get this one.
__label__neg	"""My husband and I have four masters degrees between us, and my father is an engineer."""
__label__pos	I LOVED this jumper.
__label__neg	 But, it sucked up 9 volts like you wouldn't believe. 
__label__neg	I used them for 5 months and finally got so fed up with all of the problems that I bought all new bottles.
__label__pos	We love this product so much.
__label__neg	These are still hard and also hard to store. 
__label__neu	I cannot comment on how useful this item is for swaddling a baby as we are not due for a few months
__label__neu	I placed a lap pad in it as recommended by a friend, so if it became soiled, I could easily replace the lap pad instead of trying to wash the positioner itself.
__label__neu	Totally crazy I know
__label__neg	Maybe all the car seat mirrors are problematic.
__label__pos	It was relatively simple, and I love it already.
__label__pos	My daughter loves balls and she loves chewing on tags
__label__pos	"""So I thought this will help."""
__label__neu	It is easy for her to grip and it's very smooth- no splinters, after 4 months- but maybe it's just not her thing.
__label__neu	When I had to use other bottles in a pinch, he wasn't happy eating.
__label__neg	I can't fit much in this bag without the magnetic closures popping open.
__label__pos	I must admit that my daughter enjoyed looking at this mobile for the first couple months of her life
__label__neu	We hooked it up in short order,  turned it on,  and *SCREEEECH*.
__label__pos	The answer is yes, a thousand times yes, it's worth it.  
__label__neu	They would cry and could not get their hands and fingers out without my help.
__label__neg	My baby had terrible gas and colic and i was using the Playtex Ventaire natural shape bottles.
__label__pos	"""Definately would recommend this seat for any other moms who are potty training their child."""
__label__neu	Try wiping his or her buttcrack while they're in a high chair. 
__label__neu	My baby is 14 pounds now and I just cannot use it,  he does not like it,  and I feel like it is going to rip or I will hurt my back using it.
__label__neg	 I didn't think this would be a huge issue
__label__neu	 I would buy one that is built with a slanted back and a short basin so baby doesn't have far to slide down. 
__label__neg	 The instructions recommended changing the position of the petals on the breast to get the most milk, however, during this process it would leak even more because the milk would collect between the plastic and the suction petals when the milk was supposed to be going into the bottle
__label__neg	It might not sound so bad but it more than doubles the amount of work to fill a bottle,  and at 3 AM when you have a screaming baby,  you don't want to be diddling around with the extra pieces
__label__neg	 These are unecessary and really a pain.
__label__neu	It is quite large. 
__label__pos	No complaints!
__label__neu	its two pieces; one cup, one top. 
__label__pos	"""No dice."""
__label__pos	"""Highly recommended."""
__label__neu	The headrest is in the bouncer or the swing.
__label__neg	We have an oval tub and it did not come close to fitting it due to the crazy arm on it
__label__neg	It leaked, its round opening was WAY too small, and I had a ton of problems with my son leaking all over the front and on to the floor.
__label__neu	Just the other week, my mom spilled all of his snackies on the floor when opening one of his snack containers! 
__label__neu	You don't need it if you are using a nursing pillow,   like &quot;Boppy&quot;.
__label__pos	she loves the feel of it and that toys can be hung on the loops!
__label__pos	"""Just flip the handle and the diapers fall through to the bag."""
__label__neg	 Sometimes at 4 min
__label__neu	Better just to work quickly,  and you'll get quicker with practice
__label__neg	However, I was under the impression that you could detach the napper and use it elsewhere. 
__label__pos	"""These packs convert easily from warm to cold."""
__label__neg	To use cell phones in our house, you have to stand by a window and not move or you will lose your call.
__label__pos	It is excellent!
__label__neg	 I'd go with that instead of this basket
__label__pos	"""We've not had the leaking trouble that other reviewers have mentioned with either of our purchases (2009 or 2012)."""
__label__neu	what a pain to use!
__label__neg	If I had to do it all again,  I would opt for using the big potty from the start - cleaning those things out gets old fast too
__label__neg	"""It had so much static."""
__label__neu	Quite possibly one of the most frustrating pieces of junk I have ever purchased.
__label__neg	 I was afraid it was going to tip over
__label__neu	they won't work with the toilet lock
__label__neu	"""Every dollar counts when you are a SAHM!"""
__label__neu	When I did get the proper suction the pump worked easily and my milk came down easily.
__label__pos	I had a c- section and we lived in a 2 story house what trips this saved my husband from going downstairs all night was well worth the money.
__label__neu	My wife purchased a wrap carrier (Maya wrap?) and the difference is like night- and- day.
__label__neu	"""Putting him down in his crib (in our room) didn't work..."""
__label__pos	"""I've been pumping fairly regularly for 4 months now and wouldn't think of using anything else."""
__label__neg	 I am really disappointed
__label__neu	Finally went out and bought the especially for baby electronic pump which is also about the same price and Im now a happy pumper.
__label__pos	The only drawback is that they're relatively expensive, but I guess that's the cost of convenience.
__label__pos	It also helps with her colic because of the vibration.
__label__neg	 They have the worse customer service I have ever dealt with. 
__label__neu	We have a toddler and we were told that we just had to get a guard for the DVD, and for other electronic things as well.
__label__neu	This gate is the second item returned
__label__neu	If Graco put a more appropriate sized motor in it,  I would definitely recommend this product
__label__pos	I had to have this again.
__label__neu	I tried replacing the batteries to see if I could get music,  but I did not.
__label__neu	 Our son's gas IMMEDIATELY disappeared and he no longer suffered from nipple confusion
__label__neu	My 17 month old can get out of any bib.
__label__neg	They do not fit together well either.
__label__pos	I borrowed this breast pump from my sister and it is awesome!
__label__neu	First,  the good: very clear,  no interference with any of our other cordless devices,  visual signal of volume/sound even if you've got it turned way down.
__label__pos	It's a great item to take from room to room.
__label__neu	My older son is now 14 years old and boy have baby products changed since then!
__label__pos	She loves it!
__label__neu	I was not told by my doctor that I needed to sterlize my daughter's bottles but I do anyway.
__label__pos	"I had a hard time figuring out how to get my daughter comfortable and nurse when she was born,  until my husband came home with ""my brest friend nursing pillow"
__label__neu	I received solid blue
__label__pos	We have loved it since day 1!!!
__label__neu	The directions instruct you not to use an electric warmer or sterilizer
__label__neu	I will try it as he gets a bit older and see if it works better.
__label__neg	 Nothing but lingering poopy stink
__label__pos	This allows us to make it thru the night without having to make a full crib linen change--- at least until morning.I will certainly buy this as my gift to all my friends baby showers!
__label__neu	I'd recommend you buy just one of these and try it out
__label__pos	"Now she is old enough to really enjoy the lights and noises that she can produce with her feet and ""sings"" to the variety of songs that it plays.  "
__label__neu	SIT ON IT!
__label__neg	At his daycare they have a Fisher Price Papasan swing and he LOVES it.
__label__neu	the only thing my little girl has ever done with this toy is throw it... she is completely uninterested in this toy.
__label__neu	At home I'd just use the food processor - easier and faster
__label__neu	He was napping in the swing while I did dishes, I heard him make a little noise so I turned around...
__label__pos	It make for a cute stuffed animal and thats about it
__label__pos	Not only does he love the jumperoo but all the adults love to watch him in it.
__label__neg	 I am a nursing Mother and thought these bottles we suppsose to mimic the breast
__label__pos	It is easy to install and keeps my daughter toasty warm.
__label__pos	Aah...The best thing e..v..e..r
__label__pos	It allows me to get down on the floor with her and spend time with her!
__label__neg	 Very disappointed
__label__pos	When I found this monitor offered DECT technology, I jumped on it because I've been very pleased with the quality of sound from my DECT wireless phones.This wireless monitor is just as good as my phones.
__label__pos	The muted colors combined with dark red curtains has made his room a nice little cave that is so relaxed that he frequently sleeps in.
__label__pos	LOVE IT!
__label__neu	I've got a 2 week old
__label__pos	Perhaps this will improve as he gets the hang of it.
__label__neu	I am definitely getting more of these as well as the smaller version
__label__neu	Perhaps a built- in iPod adapter with speakers built into the tray or something.
__label__neg	best decision I made
__label__neg	 The Kalencom is very sturdy and has good (but not perfect) non-slip grips
__label__pos	I love fact that it's soft instead of hard plastic which allows is to soak up warm water fast and is comfy for baby.
__label__neg	My husband said he knew a very short adult woman in college who could easily wear it, it's that big. 
__label__neu	It often got more smiles than we did.
__label__neu	absorbant but bulky
__label__pos	It is great to be able to see our little guy without having to go into his room and potentially wake him up.  
__label__pos	They sent them to me for free (including free shipping
__label__neu	I ended up throwing the whole lot out after using more money on paper towels than bottles.
__label__pos	A must have
__label__neu	Everytime you opened it to add another nipple, the ones already in there would fall out. 
__label__neu	We moved it from the sink into the tub quite a while ago, and took the mesh cradle out.
__label__neg	Also the vecro is a bit scratchy, you have to be careful when putting it on that none of it is touching babys neck or it will scratch her.
__label__neu	I use tall kitchen trash bags.
__label__neu	Ok, I have to say that since I became a mom 3 yrs.
__label__neu	 I love the look and feel of avent bottles but my son has a small mouth and was unable to get a good suction on this nipple. 
__label__neg	 The water that's stuck in the toy builds up mildew and you don't want that floating in your baby's bath water or even let your baby put in his mouth
__label__neg	"""My only warning is that I got it in black and lost it as it got buried in the depths of my plane seat, or under the seat in front of me, or somewhere."""
__label__neg	But the swing keeps moving which keeps him asleep (as soon as I stop it my baby always wakes up).
__label__neu	And a SNUG FIT!  
__label__neu	I switched to this bottle after failed attempts to use the Evenflo glass bottles.
__label__pos	(And that's with just NOW finding out that it folds for easy storage! 
__label__neg	My husband and I read all of the poor reviews on this product, and we really should have listened to them!
__label__neu	Since the only place I found for it near water source is inside our bath tub,  which places it practically at ground level,  my back is killing me.
__label__pos	"""Easy to slide baby in & out of the carrier."""
__label__pos	It also is a great neutral color (we have the graphite), which matches our grey/blue car seat perfectly!
__label__neg	They are definitely not the diaper service quality, however, if you don't have 3 different levels of diapers to choose from at your local store, how would you even know that there were different grades of diapers when it says
__label__neu	My daughter kept getting out of it.
__label__pos	It is easy to use and priced well.
__label__pos	It's great for calming her down and for long naps.
__label__neu	I thought about exchanging it for another just like it but figured it wouldnt work.  
__label__neu	All in all I'd say buy a different bottle.
__label__neu	I always wrapped my daughters arms accross her chest because she liked to suck her fingers.
__label__pos	You won't be disappointed.
__label__pos	"""When we travel, we fold it up and bring it along."""
__label__neu	I'd say, if he could speak, he'd say Swaddle Me in Microfleece.
__label__pos	"""Our son is past the stage where he will stay put in a floor bouncy chair so he loves the freedom of lying in this stretching out,and kicking."""
__label__pos	The color choice is out standing
__label__neg	We were rather disappointed with this warmer and ended up returning it and getting the Dex warmer which works MUCH better
__label__pos	"""Caveat: wait until your ready to serve to put it on the table..."""
__label__neg	I put the batteries in and nothing works
__label__pos	Our baby (nearly 4months old) loves this seat as a place to hang out with parents as they do, well, whatever parents do.
__label__pos	I'm very disappointed in Fisher Price.
__label__neg	"""The only thing I would change is the swing seems to move very slowly (I have new batteries)."""
__label__pos	Easy to use - so convenient!
__label__neu	After just a couple of months,  ours are already coming apart.
__label__neu	As an infant my son was mostly washed while he was lying on the bed and I used a basin of water.
__label__neu	My wife is expecting our first child in August, and we will be looking at breast pumps as well.
__label__neu	It has a shelf for your baby to sit on.
__label__neu	"""I buy the 100ct two boxes at a time."""
__label__neu	My baby was born 8 pounds and at 11 weeks is already 15 pounds.
__label__neu	When my six month old son falls asleep his head always ends up falling to the side or in his lap, no matter how far it is reclined and even with the head insert in.
__label__neg	4) No valve except in the cup spout
__label__neu	Maybe that's the cause of the static
__label__neg	"It's difficult to disassemble and reassemble this properly-- nothing ""clicks"" to let you know it's properly snapped into place,  and when it's not lined up exactly right,  it leaks"
__label__pos	You have to time it but again it's fast and ready to go in 6-7 minutes.
__label__pos	I wish I had used this after the birth of my first child, too, because I had the same issue with cracked nipples, but struggled with it much longer since I didn't know about this product.
__label__neu	Excuse me, ...but this product is so far from being odorless.
__label__neg	The buckle is very tricky
__label__neu	"""Only an idiot wouldn't check the temp before feeding their baby anyway."""
__label__pos	 The chest arrive and was spacious and cute
__label__neu	 The lowest setting is still slightly too high. 
__label__neu	I bought these bottles to replace our Avent bottles, due to BPA concerns.
__label__neg	Almost all rear facing seats will rebound in a crash.  
__label__pos	I'm glad I have this warmer!
__label__neu	Go figure.
__label__neg	We ended up using a lightweight fleece blanket about 2-1/2 foot square.
__label__neu	"""we have a farmhouse-style tile-top kitchen table..."""
__label__pos	The front and bottom is solid mesh so that water can drain and no mildew grows.  
__label__pos	When she discovered that pulling the bird made the fan go around, she is very intrigued.  
__label__pos	"""There is no twisting."""
__label__pos	 With Lansinoh I won't have to worry about that. 
__label__neu	It is a wider stroller, however I have not found a doorway in a public place I cannot fit through.  
__label__pos	I would highly recommend this over Baby Magic and Playtex anyday.
__label__neu	Entertaining but a Pain to Put Together
__label__pos	The span of the legs is pretty wide which you should measure for.
__label__pos	"""I wish I had registered for this in the first place!"""
__label__neu	After I used it for about a month,  my pediatrician told me not to drive with it attached anyway.
__label__neg	Babies are too smart for this
__label__neg	It smells so bad and it's so strong.
__label__neg	~*My baby used to sweat in 25 degree weather with just his clothes and this bundle me.
__label__neg	 A warning was issued in 2007 due to high amounts of lead in the blue block
__label__neg	For the price, this walker/entertainer is a very poor value.
__label__neu	I've been sleeping with it for about 2 months now and what I have found helpful is that it prevents me from rolling on my back if I use it with the 'belly support' on my back side.
__label__pos	Our babies first few months would have been MUCH more stressful without it.
__label__neg	Imagine my disappointment when I opened them up at my baby shower... As I pulled them out of the bos, chips of white paint came falling out of the baskets like snow!!!
__label__pos	But to me it's well worth the money.
__label__neu	We got the superyard (or, as I call it, the &quot;Steel Cage Death Match&quot; yard) to contain our child in the living room and den while we are working. 
__label__neg	My daughter is 3 months and weighs about 14 punds
__label__pos	She has many surfaces that are great for chewing (and he chews a lot): feet, ears, neck and face.
__label__neu	I quickly noticed the wipes at the bottom were warmer than the ones at the top. 
__label__pos	"""It has a drain & I haven't had any problems with it."""
__label__pos	"""I had a hard time getting her to nap/sleep anywhere except my arms, but she did nap many times in this adorable basket."""
__label__neg	 YEAH RIGHT
__label__pos	The vibrator feature produces a nice calming effect.  
__label__neg	 It cost nearly $30 to order this part and it took over 2 weeks to receive it. 
__label__pos	I brought this home, popped it in the dishwasher to sterilize it before using, and took it out, eager to assemble it. 
__label__neg	The back panel is not even the right _size_, so there's a gaping hole in the back of the dresser.  
__label__pos	My daughter loves to suck on her face and ears. 
__label__neg	If a child is incapable of removing this then it also means s/he can't open a door either, because it is so easy to remove, so don't get it.
__label__neu	My cons are as follows
__label__pos	"""I don't bother taking a stroller anywhere I just tie the wrap and go."""
__label__neu	We bought a box of 500 trash bags for ten dollars; Diaper Gennie will only work with Diaper Genie Bags which are expensive.
__label__neg	 All the other 'natural' sounds seemed very unnatural and mechanical. 
__label__neu	I like the little heat indicator but my own testing by dipping my hand into the water is all that's really needed.
__label__neg	"""(simple pleasures!)"""
__label__neg	It just shouldn't be all that complicated,  you know
__label__pos	He was very curious about plugs and outlets, but he never got into this cover.
__label__neg	 All he ever does is swing
__label__neu	 As others have said, the front of the drawers and outer casing of the dresser are pretty solid, but the drawers themselves are particle board
__label__neu	We have since bought a mini blow up bath (Babies R' Us or Target) and he loves it and it is easy to wash him and no troubles.
__label__pos	So easy to fold, throw in the back of the car, and go.
__label__neu	We don't look for constellations we just like the stars.
__label__pos	"""There are absolutely no hidden gaps or fabrics that can soak up or trap urine."""
__label__pos	"""He could look around and see the surroundings."""
__label__neg	"""Avent Products contain BPA which is toxic for your baby."""
__label__neu	My only two complaints are that the plug DOES NOT change color when water is too hot.
__label__neg	The handles on this thing are BPA (illegal in Canada).
__label__pos	I still liked the clear its unique.
__label__pos	The vibration (2 settings) and music/nature sounds work well
__label__neu	I'm not really fussed about the plug as I didn't buy the bath to tell me when the water was too hot or not, any mother will know and check the temp of water before putting her baby in, and although you may seem wary once you're there doing it you'll know what I mean!  
__label__neg	It does not stay flat -  Every time we pull the chair in and out it bunches up and wrinkles.  
__label__pos	"""I pump all of my daughter's milk now and this makes it easier!!"""
__label__pos	my kids love it...
__label__pos	I don't know what I would do without it.
__label__neg	He will jump until he passes out!
__label__neu	The gate works great in the upstairs hallway,  but we'll still need to buy a different gate at some point if we want the baby to have access to our room
__label__neg	 And the cards are somewhat translucent so you can see the image on the reverse as well
__label__pos	"""Overall, I think that this swing is an excellent purchase for anyone in the market for one."""
__label__pos	Although I didn't really need the mesh part (for when you do sponge baths - it's just easier to do on a towel), we really enjoy this tub.
__label__neg	 I could not hear my baby at all
__label__neg	and milk leaks out, so you have to hold it with hand with a tissue. 
__label__neg	If food gets inside that hole, you are out of luck.
__label__neu	Enough said
__label__neg	 This also seems to be one of the worst bottles that I've tried as far as air getting into the bottle and making baby uncomfortable. 
__label__pos	Now that she is learning to sit up, its a perfect helper.
__label__neu	A medium works for most people so other caregivers can use it as well.
__label__pos	We feel a little more trendy when carrying this one.
__label__neg	The button that you have to press for the shower should be on the side, it would be easier to use.
__label__pos	"""When I was purchasing it, a woman at the store said she had bought the newer 'delux' model that Madela just came out with, and it made her nipples bleed."""
__label__neg	This is for babies who have full head support and can sit up on their own.
__label__neu	This is our first baby and I researched everything we even considered buying
__label__neu	I have this on the side of our Jenny Lind dressing table.  
__label__pos	This is the only bottle our family uses, we used them for our son and now our newborn little girl.
__label__neu	often waking us up in the middle of the night
__label__neg	"""I was going to buy a few Avent disposable bottles for travel, but having to buy separate nipples made it a waste of money."""
__label__neu	AND,  the front wheels would at times jam the stroller from opening up in the first place.
__label__pos	I ordered it back it 2010 and it is still going strong 2 years later.
__label__neg	Then, she hated sitting there and cried endelessly whenever we placed her there.
__label__neg	 I vacuum pack the cubes the day after I freeze them so the lid does me no good
__label__pos	there is a place that holds shampoo/baby wash. i'll be using this when my baby is a toddler too.
__label__pos	This bottle was great for switching back and forth from breast, since I was unable to feed from the left nipple for quite a while.
__label__pos	 In the Ergo, his weight is distributed on my hips mostly and it makes him feel so much lighter than when he is in the Bjorn
__label__pos	"""I love this caddy."""
__label__neu	Otherwise,  it's kind of a pain in the rear.
__label__neu	Baby switches between the bottle and breast now,  no problem.
__label__neu	Luckily,  I had kept the box so I just exchanged it for another only to discover the second did the exact same thing!
__label__pos	In addition shapes fall(gently) as the mobile turns whcih is an added delight.
__label__neu	I am rating this a one because of the color.
__label__neg	My (very strong and big for her age) 10-month-old wants to make music so badly with her octopus but the legs don't toot so easily--it takes a strong (adult) hand to make music.
__label__pos	 But it does warm bottles really well, just have to learn to be extra careful with it.
__label__neg	 Not very useful
__label__neg	 Don't waste your money or time buying this wipes warmer- it is cheap and you will regret it
__label__neu	If and when I use the pack and play as a playpen,  I may pull the sheet out and try again
__label__neg	1 star
__label__neg	"""We figured out, however, that it's simply the noise of the pictures turning."""
__label__pos	One that doesn't have so much background noise and static.
__label__pos	The gate is sturdy comfy and attractive as well which is important in my house, most of all seems very safe. 
__label__neu	99 cent store you don't have all these issues
__label__neg	Personally I could do without the cutsie- poo duck head and tail as it increases the difficulty of storing the thing without deflation.
__label__neg	The only reason why I'm giving this a 1 star is not for the convenience it provides to others, but because it is so not necessary to have...another baby product on the market that is not needed. 
__label__neg	"""However, I can understand why she's not interested in the Dreamscapes Soother."""
__label__neg	 The last thing you want to have to do is throw away 1/3 of your wipes because they are brown and dry
__label__neu	My baby always got out of his swaddle blankets and I tried them all, including this one which he also can get out of.
__label__pos	It is really easy to fold up on my own and quickly when I am in line for security. 
__label__neg	I didnt really care for this
__label__pos	Holds a decent amount of diapers, my husband empties it once a week.
__label__pos	"""She doesn't love her bouncer at home (we have the Ocean Wonders bouncer)."""
__label__neg	I'd give this 0 stars if I could
__label__pos	It turned out to be perfect.
__label__neu	soft base (ring with hole for the nipple to fit through) can cause skin irritation if left on too long due to moisture accumulation- outward appearance through clothing varies greatly depending on breast size and type of bra used; seems to be designed to contour with size C at most
__label__neg	And Avent is SO expensive!
__label__neu	You pull the side up and there are small notches at the bottom that is suppose to hold the rail up
__label__pos	My little one loves this teething ring.
__label__neu	I must have hefted my pregnant self and my 10 month old over that gate a hundred times a day and it was taking a serious toll on my back and knees.
__label__neu	Our daughter has discovered that it's fun to open it and watch it slam shut,  except sometimes she forgets her fingers are there too
__label__pos	"""This Baby Bjorn one is also very strong, even for heavier children."""
__label__neg	Just wish it was easier to find the liners.
__label__neg	 Great concept, but there must be a better design.
__label__neg	I tried using these bottles when my baby was two weeks old,  and the feeding session ended in complete frustration on mine AND my baby's part
__label__neg	This product surely protects my leather seats but my car seat seat slides around on the seat when its in place.
__label__neg	But I quickly realized I'd made a mistake -- it took *forever* to even get one ounce of milk
__label__neu	It holds about 2 days of diapers so never get a chance to stink things up.
__label__pos	My 5 1/2 month old loves this new toy.
__label__neu	There shouldn't be anything dangerous in there anyway!!!! Save the $ and get an audio.
__label__pos	I washed it a few times and it held up well.
__label__neu	I own an Infantino front pack and baby sling and found my  6 week old didn't really like either much but she will fall asleep in this and allows me to actually switch some laundry and walk to the mail box.
__label__pos	to boot we can adjust the grip of the chopsticks to accomodate their little hands so my kids can really learn technique and not hold them like little tongs.
__label__neg	Breastfeeding isn't always easy, and the Boppy pillow makes it SUCH a hassle!  
__label__neg	 Now I need to go ammend my other review
__label__neg	This went into the trash where it belongs
__label__neg	"""Avent has to re-engineer their products."""
__label__neu	 He's a large child and at 26 pounds is way over the minimum weight of 20 lbs. 
__label__neg	My son is now 7 months old and it has never worked for us.
__label__pos	and he loves to splash water every where and there's no one to keep him in this toddler tub its a great buy.
__label__neu	The idea is great,  the product is not so great.
__label__pos	It's so convenient to be able to pour the pre-measured amount of formula into my sons bottle.
__label__neg	As you can see in the photos, the Elmos are pretty far apart, especially for baby feet.
__label__pos	it always gets his attention.
__label__pos	This has been a very useful and helpful item in our house.
__label__neu	In other words, it would take her some time to move the gate and go around it, by which time we would have caught her red-handed. 
__label__neg	 These are nice nipples but they also seem to wear out much faster than other brands we used before
__label__neg	 It was horrible
__label__neu	I spent a lot of time looking for a diaper backpack before my 2nd child was born
__label__pos	These days, I put him in it in the morningto watch a Baby Einstein DVD and he loves it.
__label__neg	I don't even try any more to 'twist' the bag,  I just take the lid off.
__label__neu	 You don't strictly speaking need a cover, it's easier if you don't use one. 
__label__pos	"""got this for son when he does his art classes it is great planning on getting another for home"""
__label__pos	The fact that it is natural in color makes it even more soft than dyed organic cotton sheets.
__label__pos	Diaper Champ works well for me.
__label__neu	She is now 12 weeks old and since I am going back to work this week,  we started being more diligent 2 weeks ago with the bottle
__label__neg	The Bjorn holds your baby closer to your body and heartbeat and my baby definatly prefers that.
__label__neg	I was dismayed to find how tired I became while expressing my milk twice a day -- the pump is not comfortable at all
__label__neu	 After using all 50, I got a few free Lansinoh bags with my breast pad purchase. 
__label__neg	 There are better ones out there
__label__pos	I felt in love with Sophie the very first time I saw her. 
__label__neg	 The thermometer [stinks]! 
__label__neu	Everything everyone else said PLUS:Previously frozen packs cannot be put into the compartemnts as they didn't freeze in the proper shape.
__label__pos	baby loves it!
__label__neu	"""I have never used the hammock feature since the tub has a padded bottom."""
__label__neg	 It also leaves her with a red ring around her butt. 
__label__neg	 The screen is angled and only displays when you hit the button
__label__neg	Runs on 4 D batteries, which it does seem to go through quickly.  
__label__neg	While it may be effective in preventing spills, it also is hard for newbies to get fluids out because they have to suck so hard and they are not used to doing that.
__label__neg	Also, when the child has taken a drink and snapped the lid closed, the straw, upon reopening, will shoot a notable amount of beverage toward and above the opener
__label__pos	My husband and I love this product and so does our little girl who's 9 weeks old
__label__neg	These burp clothes are extremely thin.
__label__pos	It is easy to pull back once we get in the car so she is not sweating in the heat.
__label__neg	It's not his fav chair though,  he prefers the swing.
__label__neg	The handrails are too short & small to be truly useful.
__label__pos	 Until this age she was fine with it
__label__neu	I was hopeful she would take it b/c I heard such good things about it and how it is supposed to be the best pacifier for breast-fed babies to avoid nipple confusion.
__label__pos	it does a good job.
__label__pos	"""I used every single one of them."""
__label__pos	This item is so helpful.
__label__neg	We recently bought this car seat without knowing that Graco car seats actually have 2 different kinds of methods of tightening the baby seat belt in the car seat
__label__neg	"""2)  Lightweight (a pro and a con) - once your kids get any sort of strength, they can push the walls around, and even push the whole thing over."""
__label__neg	 & certainly last longer than 3
__label__pos	My son prefers this to the potty chair!
__label__neg	 I'm a nurse and used to working with all types of equipment and I know junk when I see it
__label__pos	"""So, if you've already purchased the avent bottles your money has not gone to waste!"""
__label__pos	When cosleeping with an infant, this adds and extra sense of security
__label__pos	I highly recommend this to every parent! 
__label__neu	It is pretty big but made out of the same materials and the nipple is the same as the regular soothies.
__label__pos	It is well worth the money. 
__label__pos	I'm happy that it folds up for travel and storage
__label__pos	My step mother gave us one of these and I love it! 
__label__neu	 That one is more straight.3. 
__label__neg	" With the Twistaway Diaper Genie, each diaper is ""twisted"" individually into the bag, sealing in the smell"
__label__neg	Don't waste your time and money on this stroller!
__label__neu	But I sewed cotton covers myself.
__label__pos	"""I have three different Bumpkins styles, this one, the one like this with short sleeves, and the regular bibs."""
__label__neu	Our baby has really sensitive skin and it did not irritate her.
__label__pos	This sippy is great!
__label__neg	 The plastic feels pretty thin and cheap, and apparently it is. 
__label__neu	Baby Einstein is over rated.
__label__pos	Both are excellent products  fit the Bob perfectly.
__label__pos	It was definitely worth the $50
__label__neg	Waste my $$$!!.. 
__label__neu	We do have wireless Internet in our house and cordless phones,  but these were not problems with our old monitor.
__label__neg	It did not help me at all.
__label__neg	The output wasn't what I'd like, either. 
__label__pos	Over all I have been very happy with the tub and would rec.
__label__pos	It's very easy to use and clean and I love that it attatches to the bottles so I can give it right to my baby or throw it in fridge for later.
__label__pos	Then, in a moment I will remember for the rest of my life, she smiled for the first time.
__label__neu	I'll stick with my pillow arsenal - it's not ideal but it's free and works just as well as this.
__label__neu	 I can't believe that this cover is made by the same manufacturer as the pad! 
__label__neu	She also clutches the rings both top and bottom.
__label__neg	Only holds a few bottles at a time
__label__neu	I like the idea of warm wipes for baby...
__label__neu	It seems the angle of the door closing means the locks and catches do not line up properly. 
__label__neu	I choose this over the hospital pump. 
__label__pos	Definitely the best kit with the most baby essentials.
__label__neu	"""When he was three days old my husband took it back to the the store and announced that he was coming home with the Diaper Champ."""
__label__neu	She can sometimes manage it her feet if cube is braced against other object. 
__label__pos	So far we are extremely happy with this gate.
__label__neu	Second,  unless you have a flexible supply line hose to your toilet,  this device won't be compatible with your system.
__label__neg	 waste of money
__label__neg	 Not to mention, the clasps that open and close so you can put the child in are not easy to use
__label__neg	 the formula was too hot and sometimes at 6 min
__label__pos	 I think Sure Comfort Deluxe is a much better choice for new born. 
__label__neu	Those arms go in and the velcro is fastened and its darn hard for her to get it off.
__label__pos	It did make breastfeeding a little more comfortable.
__label__pos	Overall, I think it is a good product and would buy again.
__label__pos	As soon as I gave to to my 5 month old son he loved it!
__label__neg	I called customer service and the lady was extremely rude to me interupting me while I was trying to explain my problem to her and all she did was explain how to put it back together.
__label__pos	Absolutely Wonderful!
__label__pos	This is one of my most used items from my registry.
__label__neu	However,  we've had horrible interference,  no matter how many times we've changed the configuration on the bottom.
__label__neu	They've got to be doing something wrong
__label__neu	Before my first child was born, I was all set to buy the Diaper Genie but then a friend told me about the Diaper Champ. 
__label__neu	Just step and nudge.
__label__pos	Baby loves it, small and light enough for her to grasp and squeeze.
__label__neg	Ours deflated after a few months and will not stay inflated longer than a day now
__label__neu	We have a cordless phone and that doesn't interefer with it
__label__pos	"""I'd have given it less stars for breaking down, but getting free replacement parts and great customer service won back all the stars!"""
__label__pos	It works!
__label__neu	There is a little hole in the light-up ball that allows water (and who knows what else?)
__label__neg	"""Insulting and greedy, and counterproductive to generating brand loyalty."""
__label__neg	Plus,  the sheer tought of keeping track of all the lids made me cringe
__label__neg	 Mothers (and fathers) have far better things to do with their time than fiddle with the damn clips and mop up a huge mess
__label__pos	"""He loved to bounce side to side and it never got close to falling over."""
__label__neg	"""However, as a side note, the oak crib did not match its ""matching"" changing table."""
__label__neu	Our son is 3 months old and we've only just opened a second bag a couple of weeks ago!  (Each box of refills contains 3 bags, but they include one bag when you purchase the Diaper Dekor Plus.
__label__neg	The cotton one is very flimsy and doesn't compare in quality to the fleece one - if you want a cotton sleep sack - why not just put the baby in a nightgown? 
__label__neg	 Please consider buying something different for your baby. 
__label__pos	It's great for cosleeping and for nursing in bed.
__label__neu	 Also he is an average size baby, and when i put him in the seat he had just fit, and the seat looked really small with him in it. 
__label__neu	I am not talking about leaking from my 15 month old throwing the cup around either.
__label__neu	Just beware that these swaddles are expensive,  so go with one that you know will work whether you have a more passive baby or not - the Miracle Blanket
__label__neu	When searching for hampers with a monkey theme there are not many choices to choose from.  
__label__neg	 It slips slips slips
__label__pos	This pump is very good.
__label__neg	 Good thought, but I think it needs to be redesigned
__label__neu	It is not a compact tub, but smaller than some of the other huge 4 in 1 tubs.
__label__pos	"""I only work part-time, but this is a lifesaver for having enough milk to work, go out, or even milk with cereal."""
__label__pos	Sophie is a really great toy, and even though the price is a little high, believe me, it's worth it. 
__label__neg	The least little bit of moisture or texture and it wouldn't work
__label__pos	 We are much happier with Happy Heiny's and BumGenius for All-In-Ones.
__label__neu	Plus it's hard to store.
__label__neg	I will be calling Playtex to request a refund.
__label__neg	I assumed that this grinder would work just as well.
__label__pos	It makes a popping noise as it is pushed along and it absolutely delights my baby.  
__label__neu	 The car seat has side impact protection wings by our baby's head (which I love for the added safety) but it meant that the bundle me didn't fit
__label__neu	The reason I needed to get a breast pump was for occasional pumping.
__label__neu	The instructions actual say that if you have a ligher childer, which I did, that you should put a towel behind the swing to create some drag and slow it down.
__label__neg	The different ways it attaches to your car should work with any car.
__label__pos	Great for the post-swaddling months
__label__pos	Great purchase, highly recommend it as an addition to your Uppababy stroller.
__label__pos	Now he is going on 9 months and he stills loves him.  
__label__neu	She is also 26 inches now and just barely fits in it.
__label__pos	"""My sister (mother of 2) recommended this to me and I am so grateful."""
__label__neg	 there is NO way I will sit still in this
__label__neu	I guess this diaper will make a nice gift for someone who doesn't mind polyester. 
__label__neg	Also the construction of the item is not very sturdy.
__label__pos	Another problem with this backpack is that the other pocket that is not insulated is very large and deep with netting.
__label__neg	Nice idea but doesn't work.
__label__pos	"""And they are fun because of the rainforest them."""
__label__neu	Other than that, I have not had any problems with it.  
__label__pos	I did find my Boppy was useful for sitting my baby inside,  as he was learning to sit up
__label__pos	Plus,  it travels very easily - we've taken it out of town several times
__label__pos	It works great for arthritics too.
__label__pos	the pro's is the folding mechanism is quite easy to use, but you have to bend down to do it, the basket is fully lined (the Mac is mesh), the 5 pt harness is easier to adjust, the price is much lower (got my IPO on sale for $53), the stroller is rides smooth and pushes easily with one hand if needed and the recline strap is easy to use. 
__label__pos	The heating element is on top, which makes it safer than other models.
__label__neu	First,  these bags do no stand up on there own and it is very inconveniant to carry a little cup around to help fill the bag.
__label__neu	I might as well kneel on a folded towel.
__label__neu	She never got out of the Amazing Miracle Blanket,  even at 6 months (I swaddled her when we were traveling and she had a hard time sleeping).
__label__pos	 I got them because of all the great things I heard about them
__label__pos	Its versatile, can go on the real toilet and be used as a step stool.
__label__neu	A good wiping out with some antibacterial wipe,  every week or two doesn't hurt either
__label__neu	We all know if it were up to her, she would put enough diapers/clothes in there to last a week.  
__label__neu	My little girl,  who loves food and puts everything in her mouth,  didn't want to put this in her mouth.
__label__neu	Even if they are slightly brown, it just looks weird.
__label__neu	Very slow process,  I wish I would have done more research upon buying this warmer.
__label__pos	The brush is excellent.
__label__pos	Easy to change and vibrant colors to boot... 
__label__neu	Also,  if you need to sit the bottle down for a minute,  the air comes right back in the liner and you have to squeeze it out again before you can resume feeding.
__label__neg	The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is that sometime the bubbles will stop working and I have to smack the bar to get it going again.
__label__pos	My London pillow is amazing!
__label__neg	I hate pumping and really hate seeing my milk being wastes so we have stopped using the bottles to feed and only for storage.
__label__pos	I wish we'd discovered this earlier.
__label__neg	However after about 6 months of growth the baby was getting a bit big for the tub.
__label__neu	The pronto holds all your diaper essentials so you can leave your bag and just bring the bare essentials into the changing area.
__label__neu	I don't like it either, but Thermos has been around for years, and has a long standing reputation for making good products.
__label__pos	He also struggled badly with reflux and had to sleep at a 45% angle at all times and this swing was one of the few places where he would sleep for long stretches.
__label__pos	Mt daughter loves to coo at the seal and loves the music cd that comes along with it.
__label__neu	Thus far,  I have not noticed any shrinking
__label__pos	A friend of mine uses different ones that only had two different flows and was envious of my choices!GROW WITH ME- The fact that the whole set is interchangeable is great.
__label__neu	my son is 10 months old (has 1 1/2 teeth,  lol) and likes to eat fruit,  veges,  meat,  etc
__label__neu	"""I had a fever in the hospital and they did not allow me to feed my baby until my fever broke."""
__label__neu	I as of yet can't get him there on my own but I think that may be due to me being a little nervous and him still being little.
__label__neg	 Avoid at all costs
__label__neu	Or better yet, buy about 9 regular pillows, that way you can stuff them wherever you need.  
__label__pos	"""That is why we had to replace the grandparents car seat."""
__label__neu	Definitely add this to your registry or purchase it yourself for your baby... 
__label__neg	We ordered it and it won't work with ours because our oven handle is very close to the top of the door and the oven lock flap gets caught on the handle when closing it.
__label__pos	Now I don't have to worry about warming my breastmilk for the babysitter or my husband to give my little one.
__label__pos	The only baby blanket I use.
__label__pos	 I soon switched to playtex nursers and she is great with them
__label__pos	But it is GREAT!
__label__pos	"It doesn't get snug enough, even though it ""clicks."""
__label__neg	My only complaint is they don't close well and would be problematic if you had to travel anywhere with it as they would probably leak and certainly smell with dirty diapers in there.
__label__neu	The product review says it's stylish but who cares?
__label__neg	I haven't had any trouble with the chains breaking yet in the six weeks I've been using it, but the construction does seem flimsy, so I can see where that might happen in future. 
__label__neu	I don't know why.
__label__neu	I have a 3-week old, and we've used it every other day since he's been home, and he fussed for the first two times, but now he loves it! 
__label__pos	My husband and I decided that we got more use out of this item than with any other thing we bought for our baby -- it was DEFINITELY money well spent!
__label__neu	We just received this swing frame as a gift and I put it together right away and tried it out
__label__neg	These pads though when not soaked yet are like putting paper between my bra and breast so they're not comfortable at all and they crumple up a bit in places
__label__neu	At least from the inside of the car.
__label__pos	It gave me the opportunity to get a shower and promoted independence for my little guy.It is durable, cute, and easy to clean (machine wash fabric).My son loved the ocean waves/water sounds when he was younger, and then he enjoyed the baby activated feature (baby's movements activate the sound and bubbles) when he got a little older.Now, I am preparing my nursery for TWINS, and am searching for another bouncer exactly like this one!
__label__pos	 No problem with our phone or wi-fi network
__label__neu	We bought this item after extensive in- store (babies r us) research.
__label__neg	 I also used ours pretty rarely and at least two of them (out of the starter set) have cracked already. 
__label__neu	It was easy and quick.
__label__pos	This mattress pad fits my Graco pack n play perfectly.
__label__neu	I've heard so many rave reviews that when I lost my Purely Yours, I got this one (my son was not nursing so often by then). 
__label__pos	"""It's an absolute necessity and I couldn't imagine not having it."""
__label__neg	The lights feature is 2 small red flashing lights on the steering wheel. 
__label__pos	I used an avent pump with my first and let me tell you how great this pump is.
__label__neu	It's just a long long piece of elastic cloth (like 8 ft by 2 1/2 ft) which I could have easily stitched myself.
__label__pos	I highly recommend them!
__label__neg	 Very disappointing
__label__pos	..and durable!
__label__neu	It was very easy to put together and the seat cover is easily removable when it needs to be washed
__label__neg	 It would have been better if it attached to the inside of the handle, not the outside. 
__label__pos	We got the dekor plus after using the small dekor for 10 months.
__label__neu	Not really worth the extra expense,  stick with the full size or another travel model.
__label__neu	My 13 month old immediately pulled off the covers and started playing with them
__label__neg	I suggested to them that they make a product that is durable so that moms don't have to waste precious time,  money and effort replacing parts that should have been made properly in the first place
__label__pos	Loved it!
__label__neg	The unit is supposed to snap on top of the organizer, but mine kept sliding off.
__label__neu	I feel much safer knowing I can see him
__label__pos	We keep using them because they seem to be really excellent bottles and nipples she feeds easily and doesn't get a whole lot of gas.
__label__neu	My almost 4 month old was quickly bored with stuffed animals and rattles.
__label__pos	The one nice thing about this product is the handle ties
__label__neu	"""I just got rid of our superyard gate."""
__label__neu	AND THE PINK IS SOOOO CUTE FOR MY BABY GIRL
__label__neg	It's crazy that I can't find a sippy straw cup that holds liquid without leaking and is not impossible to draw liquid out of!
__label__pos	"""I recommend this product, and it makes a great baby shower gift!"""
__label__neu	The only ones that won't are infant seats with rigid LATCH (the only one currently available in the US is the Baby Trend Latch-Loc with rigid LATCH) or one with an anti-rebound bar like the Britax Companion and convertible seats that tether rear facing (all Britax convertible seats, Sunshine Kids Radian, etc).  
__label__neu	If your baby is active and won't settle down, SWADDLE HER!! 
__label__neu	The seat is not deep enough,  my 4 months old is not even close to being covered by water,  when he's on the &quot;infant side&quot;,  but the other side is too upright for babies that already sit with no problems.
__label__pos	It's easy to assemble and take apart.
__label__neg	With all the electronic gidgets and gadgets out there spend the money and get the higher end models that really do block out interference. 
__label__neu	After trial and error with soothing and trying to get my baby down for naps and bedtime without crying and upset, I recently purchased the Sleep Sheep on the Go.
__label__pos	 I loved that it could plug in so we didn't have to go through a ton of batteries to keep him moving. 
__label__neu	THEY TOLD ME TO ONLY TURN THE RING UNTIL U FEEL IT JUST ATTATCH TO THE BOTTLE AND DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN.
__label__pos	And if you don't like people to touch your baby all the time this is the way to go,  they look but don't touch
__label__neg	 Would be great if these were fragrance free, but as is they are unusable for us and possibly dangerous to those with more severe allergies
__label__pos	"""At 3 months she got a lot more use out of it like 20 minutes or more a day she could grab onto the teething star and the zebra and spin the parrot."""
__label__neu	But our son would break out of any blanket we wrapped him in.
__label__pos	I bought every kind out there, both reusable and disposable, and found some I swear by from Mimi Maternity.
__label__neg	 Even at grandma's house we would be better off just keeping a proper toilet seat there like the Baby BjornBABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer- White/ Black
__label__neu	collapsible liners,  one-way vents,  and open airways
__label__neg	I scratched up my hands every time I stuck a diaper in it
__label__pos	the remote works great and what i love the most is that the box can be set to activate the music manually, or that the music can only be activated by the remote.
__label__neg	 He now takes Gerber bottles, traditional and New Traditions
__label__neu	I just put them in the sanitary napkin disposal bins.
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	I love the size of these blankets,  they were perfect for swaddling.
__label__pos	They are so easy to put on and take off and clean. 
__label__pos	"""You can set it on the bed or sofa and it creates an instant bed for any newborn."""
__label__neg	We have a queen size bed,  and it's true that this pillow takes up so much room that it's like having a third person in bed with us.
__label__neu	The zip is inverted which allows for quick diaper changes without unzipping the whole bag.
__label__pos	This is a great thing to have and we still use it a few times a week and my son is 10 wks old.
__label__pos	I bought this for my son when he was about a month or so old, and he really liked it.
__label__neg	Once he got older ( 2 months) if he wasn't sliding down it, he was pushing himself up it.
__label__pos	"""I like how you can use the regular nipples and these are cheap enough you can just toss them (especially great when you find it two weeks later until the seat)."""
__label__neu	"""How many times have we all nodded off a bit and dropped the bottle?"""
__label__pos	There is no odor and it is very easy to use.
__label__pos	It seems to be very accurate, and gives a reading in seconds.
__label__neu	Third,  there is no way to heat these bottles in the car.
__label__pos	 I liked this better than the teddy bears with the heartbeat sound because it also had other soothing sounds that my husband and I might enjoy as well. 
__label__neg	 Also, the water level it holds(min
__label__pos	Great purchase, easy to assemble, worth every penny.
__label__neu	It seems that babies like to push buttons.
__label__pos	The pocket is a nice touch (you put your Lansinoh, cell phone, baby nail clippers, etc in it) The only possible downside is it isn't that easy to put on with one hand (for example, if you are already cradling the baby)If you're price sensitive look around, there are often significant discounts for older colors.If you've found this review helpful, please let me know!
__label__pos	This makes it so easy for us to get out of the house with baby.
__label__pos	Now that she is bigger, (5 months old, 11 pounds) she still uses the sling and we love that the pillow moves up to cushion her head and the plastic divider below supports her tushie.
__label__neu	This actually came with my boppy and I actually had a few similar already made by other companies.
__label__pos	"""The price was great, too & we've never had problems with any of our Graco products."""
__label__neu	My son is still sleeping in our room so we hardley use it,  but for my own piece of mind,  we'll probably buy another monitor when he goes into his room.
__label__pos	I like that you can use your own garbage bags with the Champ, but that's the only positive in my opinion. 
__label__pos	The best is that as a new born (before one can master the art of concealing breast feeding), you can use this to hold and feed your little one.
__label__neu	 I NOW know better
__label__neg	I think I've said enough.
__label__neg	 A bad design and not at all sterile
__label__neg	First, the way in which the hanging toys are attached to the activity bar is different than what is pictured.
__label__pos	This is a great bed.  
__label__neg	Lastly, I tried to secure this step-up to our toilet and the cushie toilet seat would then be too far back from the front of the toilet.
__label__neg	"""1)  The built-in music buttons have REALLY annoying, short little songs - there is no way to turn the sounds off or even turn them down"""
__label__neu	I had to put it on the side and was not pleased to find out that it is not possible to use unless it is hung.
__label__neg	"""They were pretty good and they didn't leak..."""
__label__neu	He uses this more then I do now.
__label__neg	The edge draws strings to tighten him in just do not do the trick.
__label__neu	I live in a condo and have cordless phones and wireless internet
__label__pos	The problem that I had with the bowl of water method is that I would over heat the water then have to do a cool down process.
__label__pos	"""i have no problems w/it suctioning to the table as long as i wet the bottom of the bowl."""
__label__pos	Much better.
__label__neg	The nipple shape is horrible
__label__neu	I did notice that when I went with it to the city (NYC), cell phones used in the same room as the receiver caused static - but once they were off it was fine.
__label__neg	Also, because of it's size you don't transport it and end up keeping it in the bathtub anyway!I found it's just easier for my daughter to take a bath with me!
__label__neu	Total waste of money.
__label__pos	easier to put straps on and 3.
__label__neu	Once he got bigger, he fit just fine in both sides of the tub. 
__label__pos	A must-have for those bottle feeding their babies.
__label__pos	Whenever he sees me packing any snacks in these cups, he loves to have them.
__label__pos	This is a cute distracting toy.
__label__pos	I would recommend this product to others.
__label__pos	"""Helps keep mom comfy during long nursing sessions."""
__label__neg	 We'll see what they have to say
__label__neu	"Very cheap,  ""plasticy"" feel to it."
__label__pos	PERFECT HANDLES FOR LITTLE ONE TO HOLD THEM IN THEIR HANDS.I think it is also shown in BABY BACH....DVD by Baby Einstein.
__label__neu	Not Just for Monitoring Babies
__label__neu	My son is a super busy-body.
__label__neu	It's not that easy.
__label__neg	I NEVER REALLY COULD GET COMFORTABLE WITH THIS THIS SLING
__label__neg	)
__label__neg	Our child sleeps through the night without event but the bleeping baby monitor wakes us up every other hour with incessant crackling and beeping.
__label__pos	We simply used two king cases to cover it,  and I had no problem curving it to fit between my knees as needed.
__label__neu	I bought a two pack and thought at first that I one was a bad egg but the same thing happened with the second so I consider it a design flaw.
__label__neu	Brown's or Platex
__label__pos	"""They are easily one of the baby products capable of handling extremes without a blink."""
__label__pos	Our 4 month old LOVES this toy.  
__label__neu	so we weren't as worried about her sleeping with it.  
__label__pos	"""This is a must have for any new parent!"""
__label__pos	SO for you mom's looking for a tub for your infant this is the one, just don't forget to buy the safer bather to go along with it.
__label__neg	I am sorry I bought this tub.
__label__neg	 it was hot outside, but my 6 week old daughter was sweating in it
__label__neu	Also, my car seat came with one.
__label__neg	"""Lovely!"""
__label__pos	"""You just cant go wrong with this purchase!"""
__label__neg	Instructions were very poor and the wheels are practically impossible to get all the way on.  
__label__pos	I am very happy with this purchase.
__label__pos	"""I put bottles, pacifiers, breast pump parts in it without a problem."""
__label__neg	 (but for us so were all the teething items, he never used a one, just wanted to chew on straps)
__label__neu	I was desperate to find something that would releive her but this bottle was not it either.
__label__neg	And when you have a hungry fussy baby its no fun to be wasting time trying to keep up with stuff like that.
__label__pos	It heats up the bottles well.
__label__pos	"""It sticks perfectly on the tub and has been up for at least 2 months with no problems."""
__label__pos	"""My brother had 2 kids before me and was a HUGE swaddle fan so recommended it highly."""
__label__neu	Rinse, wash, repeat).
__label__pos	It is absolutely something I would recommend.
__label__neg	But,  the deciding factor in my sending these back was how hard they were to open
__label__pos	"""If you are really, really, REALLY hard pressed for space, then maybe this tub is for you..."""
__label__pos	I wish all their stuff was this good!
__label__pos	The ones she likes and works best are the playtex nursers. 
__label__pos	Great purchase - highly recommended!
__label__neu	We'd watched The Happiest Baby on the Block before he was born and knew that swaddling could help calm a baby.
__label__neu	I've heard these are difficult to wash but we have not found it so.
__label__neu	Lets just say that this tub is downstairs with the rest of the lawnsale stuff for this year.....
__label__neg	The suction was too much. 
__label__neu	The mixer seems very handy but I could not use it as I intended because it would not fit down far enough in Dr.
__label__pos	I bought it for my 4 month old son and he loves it
__label__neg	 Note that BPA is only an issue with polycarbonate bottles, not with the nipples
__label__neu	I just never got the hang of this tub,  my big boy always winded up sliding around on the slick surface.
__label__pos	"""The suction cups work..."""
__label__neg	The other thing that I don't like is that you can't see them in the dark, but I don't know if thats possible with any mirror.
__label__pos	My son was small for his age for the first few months, but this swing was perfect for him.  
__label__pos	A favorite of my boys
__label__neu	I thought this would work
__label__pos	"My husband got an ""A"" for proper car seat installation."
__label__neg	 First I tried stretching the back of the bundle me over the side impact wings which made it impossible to fit the 5-point harness straps through the bundle me without interfering with the straps positioning to the point that I thought it was unsafe because the straps had to loop up and around to get through the holes
__label__neg	We were looking for something for our son when he out grew his little baby tub and thought this would be great b/c he could sit up.
__label__pos	"""then I read all the wonderful reviews on it again and thought I'd give it a try."""
__label__neg	 Around my daughter's first birthday she began to play with this
__label__neu	This is the only reason I gave this product 4 stars, not 5. 
__label__neg	Whoever thought it would be a great idea to secure a mirror over a baby using velcro wasn't thinking things through.
__label__pos	I finally just gave up onit and purchased the aquarium bath which I really like.
__label__neu	I can't believe there is so much controversy about bottle warmers and wipe warmers!
__label__neg	 It's too hard for him to get the milk out of the bottle
__label__neu	The size still works but still the manufacturer might want to take shrinking into account when they cut the original prewashed size of the item.
__label__neu	I have 3 children sleeping in cribs and have purchased many crib sheets. 
__label__neg	Well, it wasn't that bad, but it really wouldn't release. 
__label__neg	 When he turned 4 months old I had problems
__label__neu	They must not test it on carpet and with all table types because our son pushed himself back from the table today and the chair flipped backwards.
__label__neg	"""We also have the cotton jersey ones, but this only comes in large, which is HUGE!"""
__label__pos	"""Easy to use, simply add 7 oz of water in the tray, close it up and microwave for 2 minutes."""
__label__neg	That said, I would not buy it again
__label__pos	I have also used the Gerber bags, and I liked those much better.
__label__neg	Thin isn't even the word. 
__label__neu	But turning this thing doesn't really work.
__label__neu	If you have a coil mattress and keep the crib in the center of the room,  then by all means,  try the ultimate crib sheet
__label__neu	I am shocked that Avent would actually sell such a poor,  quality product.
__label__neg	My 15 month old daughter has absolutely no interest in this toy.
__label__neu	At nine dollars I thought it would be better.
__label__neu	"""If you have a 900 MHz cordless phone and a 900 MHz monitor, they can interfere with each other."""
__label__neg	"""I would strongly reccommend buying the diaper champ keeps out the smell."""
__label__neu	After about nine months we decided it was time to toss the denim portion into the wash.
__label__pos	We've been using this monitor for 3 months and have never had any problems
__label__neg	Even with the cap on liquid leaks out of the nipple
__label__neu	Our son was born with a very strong startle reflex (aka Moro reflex) and would throw his arms wide like he was falling as soon as we put his down in a crib.
__label__neg	 I even brought drawer liner with us and put it under my son's bum to keep him from sliding out, but it didn't help. 
__label__neg	Also, the lid is impossible to line up with the handles if your toddler is crying for milk or water.
__label__neg	OVERALL*If I lived in a mostly cool/cold climate this might work for me but I don't.
__label__neu	of milk in 5 minutes, and still have one arm free to hold baby.
__label__pos	"""I was so nervous to give my baby a bath by myself, but after we went and bought this tub, I've never been more confident about it."""
__label__neg	The quality of the product is just fine, but the functionality is pointless.
__label__neg	"""UPDATE: Vendor was horrible about any kind of compensation, and I wrote up a report and submitted to Consumer Reports."""
__label__neg	 The veneer is peeling off in 2 spots and the surface scratches incredibly easy
__label__pos	"""It is very very easy and convenient, altho I do wish the spoon part could be made of a softer rubber and the cap could cover the back of the spoon as well instead of just the front."""
__label__neu	I wish that I would have just spent the extra money and bought the good one to begin with.
__label__pos	OTHER THAN THAT I WOULD RECOMMENDED IT!!
__label__neg	 For a family of long legs, this doesn't work out too well
__label__pos	So far we are very satisfied customers and my husband can walk straight through the opening so the width meets our needs better than I anticipated.
__label__neg	Great bottles,  but the nipple was way too large for my son's mouth and he got a blister on his top lip
__label__neg	 The straw contains BPA
__label__neu	A stationary bassinet with no removable top would have been just as good,  and a lot cheaper.
__label__pos	my 15 month old has never liked this.
__label__neu	"""We bought this for my son when he was about 2 months old."""
__label__neg	The only down side is the music and lights didn't last too long and we had to keep reactivating it.
__label__pos	It has a lot of variances in ways to carry and the pocket on the outside is extremely handy.However, when you live in the south and have this on over anything, it's very HOT.
__label__neg	The fabric is not soft and comfortable,  it is a bit rough,  and the sling does not feel comfortable (for me) when on
__label__neg	My son is breast fed, but we have given him an occasional bottle
__label__neg	My son doesn't really like them anymore because it is too hard for him.
__label__pos	Very sensitive, but has a control for that as well.
__label__neu	It does a pretty decent job of keeping out the smell, but with how stinky my son's poos are, I still tie poopy diapers in a plastic shopping bag before putting it in the pail (also keeps from getting yucky stuff of my hands when I push it into the pail).
__label__pos	It is well made and easy to use.
__label__neg	 You have to remove the lid, allow air back into the cup and the spout to return to normal position and then put the lid back on
__label__neu	I'm on my 3rd baby and have had 2 different models of this item
__label__neg	to inspect my car.
__label__pos	With the exception of the KidKraft, I wasted my money on everything.This stool is worth every penny when compared to safety issues of all the other stools.
__label__pos	"""It's easy to install, remove, and wash."""
__label__pos	"This is one of those purchases where I was initially thinking ""wow that's expensive!  "
__label__neu	Be very careful using this play pen
__label__neu	we have a dog who is always hounding my daughter for her snacks.
__label__neu	I don't like it at all... I called madela and offer no help.
__label__pos	It looks a little intimidating at first, but once you put it on, it doesn't get any better than that!!
__label__pos	"""I picked this up at a local baby store for less than the price listed here today, but this is a good product that does the job of keeping up to three bottles' worth of formula separate."""
__label__neg	 I spent a half hour trying to get it on and then a half hour driving it back to Babies R Us. 
__label__pos	They are a bit expensive but you will never need to buy locks again.
__label__neg	 The polls on the bottom layer started to bend over with the glass bottles, and what is worst, after 1 day of usage the top rack collapsed to the bottom because I was using glass bottles (and not all the prongs were even used)
__label__neu	I haven't had to use it lately but I keep it close by just in case.
__label__neg	 This one is a decent price compared to others, but very uncomfortable so not worth it even if it is better priced
__label__pos	Even though it is a bit pricey, I feel I will get my money's worth because I plan on using it for more than one child and I know it will last long enough to do so.
__label__neu	At 2 months old our little guy was so fussy and we had tried 3 different formulas and almost every bottle.
__label__pos	But I really don't think that that is such a big deal. 
__label__pos	Yes, it is also good for feeding the baby.
__label__pos	"""The belts provide comfort for the back and shoulders,easy to carry the baby and do some things"""
__label__neu	It looks more ring like than seat like.  
__label__neg	 When it begins getting low on power, the music sounds warped, like an old warped record, which is dreadful
__label__pos	that my daughter enjoys it. 
__label__pos	Whoever invented these SwaddleMe wraps ought to get some kind of prize.
__label__pos	"I can lay her down in her crib when she is on the verge of falling asleep and I turn on the ""what does the world look like"" story and she falls asleep before it is finished.  "
__label__neg	"""But we were able to orer some directly from the company."""
__label__pos	"""We use it when our baby is in her car seat or stroller."""
__label__neg	As for the breathability - the mesh seems to be good quality,  just don't let the grabby side of the velcro attachments touch the mesh or it pulls and damages the mesh.
__label__neu	I would not recommend buying this!
__label__pos	I was happy to find that Graco made a square playpen,  not only the smaller rectangular Pack N Play
__label__pos	Love the nipple variety too.
__label__pos	It's wood with a quiet jingle bell and sturdy elastic cording covered by the wood, so you can bend it satisfyingly.
__label__pos	It is much more sturdy than the flimsy stuff I'd found at the local 'R Us store
__label__neu	Maybe we just had bad luck, but the bed itself is wonderful.  
__label__pos	This is a great large bib that is colorful and absorbent.
__label__pos	It was the best purchase I ever made for my baby.
__label__neu	I did purchase it for the $120- $130 range directly from the Fisher Price website.
__label__pos	Needless to say they went right out and got one for her!
__label__pos	This little guy is great.
__label__neu	New moms always pack EVERYTHING in their giant diaper bags.  
__label__pos	Also, I love all the side pockets!
__label__pos	The attached cups are good too for rinsing the soap off or just letting your baby play and have some fun.
__label__pos	This is a good quality product, just what I wanted, and I think i love it more than my son does.
__label__neg	If you are going to use this swing, make sure you are within eye sight of your baby, don't take any chances and leave baby for any length of time because his/her head can get caught in the side, even with the net there.
__label__neg	I was told that this was a top of the line monitor but after receiving it as a gift, I had to return it because of all the static
__label__pos	"""All of these options work independently of one another, which makes this product even more appealing."""
__label__neg	 Perhaps we got a defective one
__label__neg	 It is very expensive
__label__neg	The two bottom pieces are too small to hold much,  and things fall off of them
__label__neu	So if I didn't always have time to sit and play with them for 20 mins it was a complete disaster.
__label__pos	These bottles are lightweight so they are perfect for travel.
__label__neg	 At first I looked at the precious planet one since that seems to be the most popular
__label__pos	 Pillows work just fine!UPDATE: after 2 years and 2 babies, the Boppy is now my favorite for when the baby is around 5 months old-7 months: for putting behind them for sitting up! 
__label__neg	It's too soft, it's rounded, and it's too low.  
__label__neu	The way it attaches, the baby looks at the back of it's blank white head!
__label__neu	With the diaper champ you use a normal kitchen trash bag - I buy the vanilla scented ones
__label__pos	Even my 4mo son was very interested in it.
__label__neu	They do not look flattering under a TIGHT fitting shirt (loose is always best anyways) but what does when you are breastfeeding for the first few months as things are adjusting.
__label__neg	 I am going to sell my Bjorn
__label__pos	Well nearly 100% of tub units we saw had U shaped corners as opposed to the V shape you need for this to work.
__label__pos	She loves the crinkly texture and sound of the wings.
__label__neu	But, we still have the safer bather for our baths together!
__label__pos	 all the litle extras it came with are great, and the case is discreet and keeps the bottles cold for a few hours
__label__pos	"""He can't really chew on it so I don't see it as an issue."""
__label__neu	According to a couple of customers who researched them the differences are basically color.
__label__neu	I got this thinking I could keep a wipe case, diapers and the changing pad in it, well I can't. 
__label__pos	My baby loves, loves, loves this swing
__label__pos	I love this chair.
__label__neu	My son is now 11 months old and I have been using this tub since he was 5 weeks old. 
__label__neg	I could not get very much with this and needless to say it was not helping. 
__label__neg	 I called my lactation consultant & she had me pumping every 15 minutes to regain my milk supply
__label__neu	At first I could not get any suction, but you have to use the thing right to get any!!! 
__label__neu	They need to CORRECT THE DESCRIPTION of this item
__label__neg	ugg
__label__neu	products we have bought from them have either malfunctioned prematurely,  or have fallen short in expectations due to shoddy construction and/or poor design.
__label__neu	!
__label__neg	I never got to use the cup and have simply put it in the category of things that didn't work for me.
__label__pos	"""I was honestly a little worried about switching between bottle and breast, but these have been great."""
__label__pos	I have also found that if he is really sleepy, and fighting going to sleep, I can put him in this and he is out within minutes, and I can take him out of it after he's been asleep for a few minutes and go put him in his bed without him waking up! 
__label__pos	I highly recommend this item!
__label__neg	I would look for something bigger and something that fits the entire bed, not just a small section.  
__label__pos	They don't dent in my diaper bag or purse.
__label__pos	He likes to see the stars on his ceiling at night.
__label__pos	Also the backsupport seems to be really good for her.
__label__pos	My 18 month old still loves this thing.  
__label__pos	"""The hammock makes him feel very secure."""
__label__pos	"""He loves to chew on the attached bone and squeeze it to make the crinkle sound."""
__label__neg	 It's going back tomorrow and I will buy more 9 volts. 
__label__neg	I don't think so - I'd search for a better alternative that plays music.
__label__neg	 It is no fun pulling apart a diaper pail at 2:00 in the morning because the handle won't go down due to a diaper that is stuck in it
__label__neg	It was awful
__label__pos	We purchased over 20 Avent bottles for my daughter before she was born because we had heard so many great things about the bottle and also saw the good reviews
__label__neg	 And for all the reasons listed above, I find this pump to be overpriced and not worth buying
__label__neg	 they're sturdy but the hard plastic is tough for even my 3 yr old to push together
__label__pos	"""This one also seemed to be more robust than the early version that I had reviewed."""
__label__pos	"""We have these in our church nursery and they are really fun cars!"""
__label__pos	It is worth the price!
__label__neu	Do reduce burping but is it necessary?
__label__neg	boo.
__label__neg	 I was very disappointed because I thought the Bundle Me would be perfect to keep my winter baby warm through a New England winter
__label__pos	"Still, she is by no means ready for a baggie or an open container, so without these containers she wouldn't be able to ""snack on the go."
__label__pos	I'm told this is very sturdy for a swing, so I guess for a plastic one that can hold only 25 lbs.
__label__pos	It's so much better,  especially on your back!
__label__neu	It will last me for years. 
__label__pos	 I will be much happier with it when we can switch to forward facing in 6 months
__label__neu	I looked everywhere for a tub without all the grooves for baby's body - I wanted something that would submerge nicely from the neck down and this looked like it would do the trick.
__label__neg	 I threw it away & started using a plastic cup & guess what
__label__neu	I've since given up.
__label__pos	This monitor has freed up our lives, and we will never part with it.
__label__neg	I brought it back. 
__label__neu	They are slim and hold about 7-10 diapers
__label__pos	I'm not really sure what the purpose of it is, but I guess it keeps my daughter from opening the buckle herself - not that she has the hand strength necessary.Overall, for the reason I bought this, I am happy.
__label__neg	This is the worst music/soothiing toy we have purchased
__label__pos	"""Let me tell you, it is great."""
__label__pos	For some reason it's not letting me change my 'star status',  as I'd like to update it to a 4 star!!  You know,  when I first bought this I didn't realize how great it was!
__label__pos	This pump is the best!!!! 
__label__neu	It's not a minature version of the New York Symphony stuffed into a $600 Bose music player, like some people are expecting.
__label__neu	So I was going to sell the mirror, but then I touched the mirror with my hand (I guess I had lotion on??) and there was a huge black smear.
__label__neg	 Very irritating
__label__pos	I am totally impressed with this stroller.  
__label__neu	We did get the rug,  found the set of pictures that match,  and use the crib skirt.
__label__neu	!
__label__neg	It is definitely loud, but putting a folded towel over it helps.
__label__neg	I bought this kit because I have been using an Avent pump and pouring the milk into the Playtex system (a pain which kind of defeats the purpose of having a pre-sterilized system,  but the pump makes me happy and the Playtex nurser makes my baby happy).
__label__pos	This is a fabulously built seat though, but we're going to have to buy the Diplomat or Roundabout instead.
__label__neu	It doesn't fit my 5 month old and I ordered the 6-12 month size...cute but I guess I will pass it on to a friend with a newborn because it's not worth shipping back.
__label__neu	 Twice
__label__neg	"""My baby is only 2 months old (weighs 14 pounds) and the infant insert is already so difficult to use."""
__label__pos	"""The legs started bending a little too, towards the end, but over very happy we got it."""
__label__neg	 The lights are always going on because of the noise from the static but sometimes the lights don't work & ofcourse that is when my baby is making noise
__label__neu	This is a good blanket, but it only fit my newborn for 2 months
__label__pos	"""They fit inside my nursing bra (at home, too bulky to wear in public)."""
__label__pos	I bought them on a whim and boy was a glad.
__label__pos	No leaks though.
__label__pos	"""We use this on top of our daughters play mat so that she can lie on something padded while she bats at the hanging toys on her gym."""
__label__neg	 The paint job on each was poorly executed--especially around the ears. 
__label__neu	it's made of  lightweight foam
__label__neg	 It can hold his attention for max 2-3 minutes
__label__pos	"""Not a must-have, but it's certainly a nice to have!"""
__label__neg	but it really is ugly.
__label__neg	I looked at the ammount in the bottle after a few minutes and he hadnt gotten anything
__label__pos	"""He lies snugly on it while I soap him up and don't have to worry about a slippery baby falling out my hands or hitting himself against the tub."""
__label__neu	"""My son is 32 1/2 inches tall and only weighs 23 pounds."""
__label__neg	I don't have too many of this company's other products,  so if this is an example of their quality than I don't think I will
__label__neg	 I am going to try the Lanoish washables instead since they seem to have a better reviews
__label__neg	I just wish I'd gone straight to that one and saved my money on this one
__label__pos	Amazing.
__label__pos	"No 2am ""I'm cold"" crying, plus we don't have to worry about it ending up over his face."
__label__neu	When I see her putting her hands off to the side where they could be smashed between the door and the bounce  I always tell her (though she is only 7 months and doesn't understand but someday she will) that she needs to keep her hands inside the ride at all times.
__label__neg	The con is that you either have to get your child to hold still while you sweep it across their temple/forehead, or you have to learn to be quick and hold your hand steady while the child moves.
__label__neu	Our Babies R Us hardly ever has them in stock so instead of returning it and waiting for more to come in, I had to restring the tie through the liner and sew it back together.  
__label__neg	"""2.  The blade that is supposed to cut the bag so that you can empty the contents has never worked the first time."""
__label__neu	this one does not have the valves that you have to take out to clean then put back in. 
__label__neu	I have a large belly,  yet I am small in size.
__label__pos	( wake up place the bottle in the warmer change the diaper the bottle is done by the time you are and has even had time to cool for a moment).
__label__neu	She has eczema and everything.
__label__neu	I tried all the others.
__label__pos	which means its probably better feeling for baby!
__label__neg	 Over all, the Avent bottles are a waste of money
__label__neg	 They don't squirt well at all
__label__neg	"Also,  the fact this mattress' inner materials are ""organic"" is pointless because it's entirely wrapped in some kind of plastic"
__label__neu	Being that my hubby's family lives in New Jersey we were able to pack clothes for the baby for two days or more.
__label__neu	So, we packed up the Baby Einstein and took it back and came home with the Exersaucer.  Yes it is more money, but it is also more fun and you can buy different toys to stitch in and out.  
__label__pos	"""I bought it after redaing several reviews and am very happy that i got this tub for my little one."""
__label__pos	Batteries last forever in this swing, it folds up, swings strongly, and is comfy for the baby!
__label__neu	Would recommend this kit but am hoping the fit will be better as my newborn grows.
__label__neg	They leaked everywhere
__label__neg	 It was difficult to get the bottle at the right temp - it was either too hot or too cold
__label__neu	I'm using this right now for my tall 10 month old baby and she doesn't slip off the mat but the mat and her slide around the tub together.
__label__pos	The fabric is nice.
__label__neg	NO GOOD!
__label__pos	It is so nice to be able to put the baby down in something and have your hands free.  
__label__neu	 I would suggest scouting ebay, yard sales, and second-hand stores instead of buying a new one. 
__label__pos	So I bought this VentAire because it has a smaller nipple AND is good for gas
__label__neu	I had no idea it did that till I saw this page!) 
__label__neu	I got mine on ebay.
__label__neg	 I will be selling my CARES and getting this instead for next time. 
__label__neg	First off the cover does not open without popping off the hinge and needing to be reattached,  the batteries only lasted through two cd's,  the volume doesn't get very high,  and it doesn't even fit on the side of our crib
__label__pos	It is easy to adjust the positions.
__label__pos	It's great how fast it registers the temperature after it is placed in the water.
__label__pos	It was awesome. 
__label__neg	The only downfall is that I haven't seen the refills at the local Walmart or Target and the nearest Babies R us is 45 minutes away so we order them online. 
__label__neg	They were all bad accidents just waiting to happen.
__label__neg	 He liked the color, but never wanted to chew it really
__label__neg	 Maybe it will work better when she has head control
__label__neg	What's worse, the blanket unravels and wraps around his neck.
__label__pos	I highly recommend this product.
__label__neu	I did not like this  this tub.
__label__neu	We tried the other mobile at night, but he really couldn't see it--even with a night light.
__label__pos	Still, worth every cent I paid for it!
__label__neg	 Supposedly, if you already owned the set you could send in your blue block for a replacement
__label__neg	She is now 13 months old and it was a major battle at each travel destination.
__label__pos	Love it.
__label__neg	could not even try it it didn't fit on our crib.
__label__pos	I like this bedding set.
__label__neg	The entire back of Jacques' plumage consists of a variety of black and white patterns, which my son loved to stare at.He is now 7 months, and doesn't play with it as much as he used to since he is more into musical and talking toys, the jumperoo, and is busy crawling and cruising...but Jacques continues to never be too far from my son's reach.
__label__neg	Now, the reason for the two stars: the motor went out
__label__neg	He stays in this chair for 5 minutes max before he yells to get out.
__label__neu	I was very excited to get my son this cup to drink out of.
__label__neu	my son had plenty of time to leave a few marks on his expensive crib
__label__pos	It matches my daughters car seat and is made by the same company.
__label__neg	it does not align perfectly with the end it snaps onto.3.
__label__pos	"""My husband and I love this bag."""
__label__neu	I am a huge fan of the Lamaze plush toys.  
__label__neu	My 2nd daughter is currently 4 months old.
__label__neu	Save your money and don't buy these.
__label__neg	 It's pretty disappointing
__label__neu	Maybe our next baby will like it more.
__label__neg	It also limits their head movement when they are awake, so I had to take it off anyway.
__label__pos	"""We love this."""
__label__neu	I didn't really use this so it was a waste of money.
__label__neg	I do not mind this setup,  but find it disappointing to have to deal with it for a product at a higher price point
__label__neu	So every few seconds, the lid has to be removed to allow air back in, the nipple returns to normal position and then lid put back on.
__label__pos	The Boppy on the other hand can be used for tummy- time and to help them sit up.
__label__neu	We had a first years tub for our two older sons, but when Fisher Price came out with the Aquarium tub, we just had to get it.
__label__neu	When he throws tantrums or get restless.
__label__pos	It's pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it.
__label__pos	When I first bought Snoogle,  I loved it,  as it was perfectly supportive as promised.
__label__pos	"""He would just lay in it and would be entertained for a long time, which bought me time to do housework around him, etc."""
__label__neg	 Also it has a noise alert but no sensitivity function - so every time the baby makes a peep in turns on - which anyone who has a newborn will tell you means its going on every 10 seconds. 
__label__neg	 Once she figured out she could make it play without going potty she quit using it.
__label__pos	These bottles are great.
__label__pos	However, there are not that many baby items that you can say you got almost 8 months use from - so I'm very satisfied.
__label__neu	It needs its own bath room.
__label__pos	"""This was one of the best purchases we've made!"""
__label__neg	It worked well for the first two weeks and my baby really like the hanging toys but then the batteries died.
__label__neu	"""I have washed it in the washing machine a couple of times, just to make sure it is not getting gross."""
__label__neu	I originally bought this as a way to make sure my baby stayed on her back or side while sleeping.
__label__pos	We recently took the system on a train ride and the carry bag that is included was great to have to tote the seat around in, the only negative is that the bag is a little tight to close.The only negative is that it is a little akward to fold, but that is very minor.Also, ours did not come with the 'Orbit' logo on the stroller bar.
__label__neu	"""I have a small baby that I bought the Kooshies for."""
__label__pos	"""I definitely like using this electric nail filer than a regular emery file from Babies R Us because I always file too much and end up messing up her nails."""
__label__neg	I threw the rest of the box away.
__label__pos	They do look a little cuter in the pic, but they're nice none the less.
__label__neg	 She got so much air when she sucked on the bottle, we could not use it
__label__neu	I dont understand why,  in these reviews,  its working in some cases and not in others.
__label__neg	They need to make the straps way longer(test this on different types of cribs). 
__label__pos	As a mom who knows a lot of other mom's with little ones, I can honestly say that we all agree...the Diaper Genie is the best!!!!
__label__neg	"""The baby has no trouble peeling it off in the few places where it does stick, either."""
__label__neu	Baby was not happy after being used to faster motion.
__label__neu	She was sleeping 6 hours a night at 6 weeks and 8 hours by 10 weeks. 
__label__neg	If you do buy these I wish you more luck than we had!
__label__pos	It's really easy to clean, and I'm no longer afraid to let my child feed himself goopy, staining foods!
__label__neu	And the 5 times I used it after that too.
__label__neg	This is the first that will be going back
__label__neu	Contrary to the reviews i read the installation was easy and straight forward.
__label__neu	After having a small choking incident, which I was able to react quickly to, I bought this to relieve some of my fears.
__label__neg	If you want a truly organic mattress spring for the expensive Naturepedic one
__label__neu	The first time I did it I lost a whole bunch of milk.
__label__pos	Also - I still had my Graco infant seat from my daughter, so I was able to use it for my newborn because this stroller will hold just about any carseat out there - safely I must add. 
__label__neg	This is very heavy so that it cannot be lifted by any young child.
__label__neg	Whoever came up with this design must have been an idiot
__label__pos	To start with I loved these cups - my daughter went from bottle to these without missing a beat.
__label__pos	The bumps really feel good on her gums.
__label__pos	"""And as a side note: the bouncer was very easy to put together."""
__label__neg	He gets very hot in this blanket (despite central A/C and ceiling fan--his back and neck are drenched!
__label__neg	We had to make TWO trips to Home Depot to get replacement screws
__label__neg	These sheets are not good at all
__label__pos	It takes only 4 mins to sterlize your bottles nipples pacifiers etc
__label__pos	Totally worth the money you spend on it.
__label__neg	I'll try it again when my son moves out of the infant carrier and into the big car seat.
__label__pos	"""I've returned to work and my son is exclusively breastfed."""
__label__neg	 They don't lie down flat, so you can't freeze them in a nice flat layer to stack in the freezer
__label__pos	But the best part are the clearly marked nipples.
__label__neg	However, he's at the stage where he wants to put everything in his mouth, and he tends to get frustrated becaues this doesn't really lend itself to being chewed on.
__label__neu	"""Hope this helped!"""
__label__pos	The one-hand squeeze handle allows me to do other things while pumping!
__label__neg	At 8 months he didn't pay much attention to them and at 1 year he still doesn't
__label__neg	From the front seat,  I could push the back of the carseat (in the rear-facing position) so that it would hit the seatback in the back seat.
__label__neu	I hope this helps.
__label__pos	My daughter especially enjoyed looking at the ladybug.
__label__neu	That's about it.
__label__pos	Very simply, Put these on your registry, you won't be sorry.
__label__pos	"""It is easy to clean and for that, I am very pleased."""
__label__neu	However 90% of the time getting the proper suction going was the hardest thing.
__label__pos	 The reason I registered for them is because everyone says they are strong and don't leak. 
__label__pos	This sturdy little booster is a workhorse, putting up with curious, sticky fingers meal-after-meal.  
__label__neg	 It's WAY TOOOO BIG
__label__neg	If I had written a review on this item the first few months I had it, I would have given it 5 stars and only praises. 
__label__pos	After trying several pacifiers including the binky, my 2 month old loved the soothie.
__label__neu	I use this one in the den.  
__label__neu	I purchased this for my 8 week old son who is 10 pounds and growing longer everyday. 
__label__neg	We started with the Diaper Genie as most new parents seem to do for some reason and we hated it
__label__neu	Our boy has been trained with a bunch of musical toys that require button punching and he learned rather quickly.
__label__neg	 She wanted her hands out, which was no big deal
__label__neg	yep, they really did
__label__pos	OK I got this at my shower and I thought it was pretty neat.
__label__neu	We registered for this set and got it as a gift
__label__pos	She is still learning but this product is so great we might skip bottles all together and graduate to these after the breast!
__label__pos	This hamper is cute and sturdy enough to hold quite a few baby clothes with no problem.
__label__pos	I have been wanting to get this product for a while.
__label__neg	 Save your money and wash you bottles well by yourself
__label__pos	""":c)Also get the extra refill pack."""
__label__neu	 Buy the old school kind for REAL safety
__label__neu	The first time I thought I might not be doing it right.
__label__pos	"""They were easy to install and do not leave marks on teh walls."""
__label__neu	They can be purchased separately at some stores. 
__label__pos	"""Highly HIGHLY recommended."""
__label__pos	Very easy to replace garbage bags you do not have to touch anything.
__label__pos	"""Although it does take a bit longer to open/close, it is definitely much more secure than my other baby gates."""
__label__neu	I'm a pediatrician and was skeptical about using this, since I'd never seen it in use in any medical office.
__label__pos	Two thumbs up!
__label__neg	This pump is NOT efficient in multiple daily pumpings
__label__neg	 In the end I just wasn't comfortable that my son could be safe in his car seat with the Bundle Me
__label__neu	This is my baby's fourth SwaddleMe.
__label__neg	I always ended up making a mess when trying to use the 'spout' at the bottom of the bag
__label__neu	 I was not sure if I wanted to buy another one since our old one worked okay. 
__label__neg	 We used it for a month and then threw in the towel
__label__pos	I love this thing
__label__pos	My daughter loves this cup for one distinct reason: She can fling water around on every surface in the house and then slurp it up!
__label__pos	"""All you have to do is add water and pop it in the microwave for 2 mins."""
__label__neg	These monitors were priced reasonably, but I would have rather paid more if that meant better quality.
__label__neg	0 in my wishlist,  and when g-ma ordered some for baby,  this is what she got.
__label__neu	I got this for Christmas from my Mother-in-Law.
__label__pos	The vibration soothes her to sleep.
__label__pos	"""It helped give him standing time."""
__label__neu	 You get what you pay for
__label__neu	I bought this because of the high user ratings / comments & a recommendation from my Doula.
__label__neg	There is not a good instruction manual for such a simple toy.
__label__neu	"The ""pouch"" part of it is pretty useless, but it doesn't matter."
__label__neu	If you have any way of trying before buying I'd suggest doing so-- maybe borrow one from a friend to see if your child takes to it.
__label__neg	I was not comfortable kneeling on it and I felt like my weight would break right through the flimsy little styrofoam- like cushion.
__label__neu	If fisher price improved this potty by making it a little bigger for boys and improved some other things, then it probably would be the best potty.
__label__pos	But seriously, who cares, it's all about safety and this car seat is safe.  
__label__neu	I just use that as a sign to empty it, spray with Lysol and replace the bag.
__label__neu	We looked at a variety of things that neither my wife the boy or I had any particular interest in.
__label__pos	Once you have the neck adjusted where you like, you can just slip on and off over your head.Probably the most ingenious feature of this cover is the pliable plastic bridge at the top of the cover, allowing the cover to stay away from your body so you can actually peer down and see your child.
__label__pos	 Audio does this nicely
__label__pos	"""My son loves crawling after them and trying to get them to ""go"" on his own."""
__label__pos	We are still working on going always on the potty but she loves the potty itself.
__label__neu	I forgot which product I'd purchased.
__label__pos	"""It took me about 30 minutes to assemble the directions were easy to read and assembly wasn't hard at all."""
__label__neu	I recently gave the red one to my 23 month old grandson.  
__label__pos	"""It is adjustable to fit into any type of toilet seat."""
__label__neg	It has so much things you have to assemble
__label__pos	A must have for breastfeeding mothers!
__label__pos	Works well!
__label__neg	After he repeated this process for several days I was tired of cleanign up the mess and the spout finally acquired a little tear which caused liquid to leak out steadily.
__label__neu	you should regularly check it to make sure it's securely affixed to the door frame
__label__neg	I have to agree with the other reviewers about this being more toy like than serious potty training. 
__label__neg	Also, these DO STAIN
__label__neg	With a very fussy newborn, I did not have time to waste assembling the bottle. 
__label__pos	The vibrating seat puts him to sleep every time too.
__label__neg	If you get one that works take it off to wash their hands
__label__pos	It is very easy to clean and goes wonderfully with the rest of the decor in my child's bathroom.  
__label__pos	No complaints here my son is 10 months and pulls up on everything so it is nice to know he is safe! 
__label__pos	this is a good pump.
__label__pos	"""Also, the vibraion turns off after awhile as to not wear out the battery."""
__label__neg	The major downside is the price. 
__label__neg	 The truth is that you will probably not need it. 
__label__neg	I wish there was a locking option for when I put my daughter in the chair, so the swing wouldn't move when Im trying to put her in it.4.
__label__neu	"""I'll try to get them to warranty it, at which time I'll follow up again."""
__label__pos	I think it is cuter than the traditional saucers and is more entertaining.
__label__neg	Otherwise,  the sheet is soft.
__label__pos	It is also a nice discreet bag to travel with.
__label__neu	We did alot of research on diaper pails and this one came out on top.  
__label__pos	Overall despite the few minor issues mentioned I am very pleased with this product.
__label__neg	"""Just the price!"""
__label__pos	I love how much cushion is all around.
__label__neu	The second time...
__label__neg	I got this toy and the packaging was covered with scotch tape and quite sad looking
__label__pos	The best mobile I have seen yet...
__label__pos	"""No wonder they've been voted among the best baby products for several years in a row!"""
__label__pos	He loved that he was able to sit and splash in his new tub seat.
__label__pos	A great product!
__label__neu	The material is Ethylene vinyl acetate and is not meant to be ingested!
__label__pos	Once it got too warm for his carseat I put it in his Graco Quattro Tour and he loves it.
__label__pos	"""While I do agree that the mobile is heavy, it was great for our needs."""
__label__neu	You can try to put another pillow underneath the Boppy, but it will eventually slip off your lap.  
__label__pos	It will fit in the diaper bag and it is easy to put on like a purse and the baby fits right in
__label__neu	I can hear my son breathing, and dogs barking and all of that very clearly. 
__label__neg	"""the music plays only a short time, which is a pain because I have to keep winding it."""
__label__pos	These pads are very thin and do not show through your clothes.
__label__neu	I even tried the medium flow.
__label__neu	when your kid (in my case twins) outgrows toys every month or two you really appreciate the staying power of a toy that can last 6 months!
__label__neg	It's a poly/cotton blend and it's rough and itchy.
__label__pos	Other than that, this is the best pregnancy product I've come across (and this is my 4th baby!)
__label__neu	Using the sling for an infant can be challenging/dangerous because it does not really craddle the baby.
__label__pos	It is so multi-tasking.  
__label__neu	I am a first time mother.
__label__neu	It works though so I will stick with them.
__label__neu	Arm's Reach really knows how to rob people.
__label__pos	Our son preferred it to the airflow positioner. 
__label__pos	This is easy to put on my often squirmy toddler son for breakfast so that we can now go to school with clean clothes
__label__pos	It's dark brown (not black) w/ the pink flowers.It comes with attachment staps so you can hang it on a stroller.
__label__neu	Ths reason I give this blanket 4 stars is because it doesn't work without the other swaddle blanket on top.
__label__pos	"We checked Consumer Reports before buying our car seat and this car seat was the ONLY convertible car seat that was rated ""excellent"" for crash protection.  "
__label__pos	It is INCREDIBLY easy to do!
__label__neu	I had to sell this stroller after one use because I kicked the wheels probably a dozen times.
__label__neu	Also, dishwasher safe, which is a must in my house.
__label__neg	What goes?
__label__neg	 They are mediocre
__label__neg	I bought one when my son was about 9 months old and he wasn't able to hold it at that point, so I had to hold it for him.  
__label__neu	I bought this from Babies R Us
__label__neg	 It says it's breathable, but in 80 degree weather it was too hot
__label__pos	"""Good quality!"""
__label__pos	"""And he has been cruising around with me ever since."""
__label__neg	This made is EXTREMELY difficult to see how full you were filling up the bottle.
__label__neu	Reviews had stated that the regular one was a bit large and we didn't feel we needed the heartbeat for my 16 month old.
__label__pos	The Nuby sippy cups and The First Year disposable sippy cups are the only ones that my 12+ months son likes.
__label__pos	I gave it up recently when my 1 1/2 yr. old was tired of it after using it with my now 3 yr. old AND I just have to say  that it was a life-saver sometimes!
__label__neu	Bundle her up in a coat and hat blankets.
__label__neg	Two problems: first, the rubber is so rigid you can't get a good seal without pressing REALLY hard.
__label__pos	I love the fact that it can be used up to 40# so she can use it as a rocker for the next couple years
__label__pos	This uses much less water though and we can take the warming bottle to another room.
__label__pos	 It also holds a lot more, and has no metal pieces whatsoever.
__label__pos	"""He can spend over 30 mins at a time playing by himself."""
__label__neu	Same thing with rattles and clutch toys-- holds them for a few minutes at most and then is bored.
__label__pos	My child loves this teether!
__label__neg	The elbow &quot;cushion&quot; is also not very soft.
__label__pos	"""We've had no problems."""
__label__neg	 you only get 8, i was expecting more
__label__neu	"""The seat was made entirely from hard plastic."""
__label__neg	5 months
__label__pos	"""But, my JJ Cole changing pad fits great in there."""
__label__neg	"""(She's only in the 15% for her height) but if it folded down like a lot of the others she would be able to."""
__label__neu	He had no problem switching between the wide neck bottle and the breast.
__label__neu	Now he hangs out and only cries once I start washing his hair.
__label__neg	then it sucks really hard. 
__label__neg	It either under or overheats about half the time.
__label__pos	It also offers me a safe place to put them if I need to do something quick like pour a bottle.
__label__neg	 For me, I would like ot be able to keep my baby occupied while I get a couple of things done, and at this stage (3 months), this still didn't do the trick. 
__label__pos	"""Also, the vibration is MUCH quieter with this one."""
__label__neu	I've also seen some of the negative feedback, and I don't have of those problems at all!
__label__pos	It is a great tub, and a great price!
__label__neg	BIG MISTAKE!
__label__neg	 I would soak through a cloth pad in a couple of hours. 
__label__pos	We also get reception in most of our yard.
__label__pos	And if he's happy; I'm happy.
__label__neg	However to me it was not worth it b/c of the problems we had with the nipples.
__label__neg	I absolutely hate this pump
__label__neg	"I found several,  but the cutest one by far is the one that matches the Lambs & Ivy ""Twinkle Twinkle"" bedding set."
__label__neg	I had bought this for my son when he was a few months old
__label__neg	 The concept works but the design is worthless
__label__neg	"""The diapers come out 3 at a time, the shelf for the wipes container will buckle if you have a full container, and the plastic is very flimsy."""
__label__neg	the idea - awesome but the product not so much
__label__pos	AMAZING
__label__neu	She wound up sideways in it during the entire bath and I never used it again.
__label__pos	my son had a blast seeing his feet for the first time
__label__pos	This is a great purchase.  
__label__pos	"""I got tons of complements when I take it out."""
__label__neg	I regret this purchase.
__label__neu	 I tried a number of times over a 3 week time frame but she refused. 
__label__neg	The sling is too small for my my 12 weeks old daughter. 
__label__pos	I recommend this to everyone I know, totally worth the $$!
__label__neu	I had my baby in December 2005 and I am still using the original bags it came with as of February 2006.  
__label__neu	I've tried 2 others but this one is the one!
__label__neg	This product was a gift and it is more trouble then its worth
__label__neu	"""The one seat that did end up staying in our house seemed great at first, but I later discovered that there were gaps on the bottle of the seat that captured urine and required constant cleaning."""
__label__pos	He would love to stare at it and the toys hanging above him. 
__label__neg	 In addition, the holes in the card to attach to the main apparatus are inconsistent so that some fit too loosely and are easily knocked off while others are so tight I can't get them attached
__label__neg	 It also difficult for me to expand or close the tub. 
__label__pos	The tub is easy to drain.
__label__neg	It it should not be the solution anyway!
__label__neg	"""They are way too expensive and didn't work well for us."""
__label__neu	I was able to start using it as soon as my baby was born because he weighed over 8 pounds.
__label__neu	He doesnt mind now I think hes gotten used to the bump.
__label__neu	"The ""protector"" is there for decoration only,  at least that's what it seems to me...and let's not even talk about the book that was easily torn apart by a 15 month old...I should have bought the potty chair that can also be used as a stool,  at least I could have got some use out of that..."
__label__neg	If you are a 1st time mom with a crying baby and you are doing this by yourself and you cant have 10 eyes, this is a waste of money and I am sure glad I did not spend my own money on this but I felt bad for the person who gave it to me as a gift
__label__neu	(So if you have a baby who fusses at it, avoid it for a few days and try it again for brief periods to get the baby used to it.)
__label__neu	she has used it since day oen.
__label__neu	Also my husband would load the diaper into the top but routinely forget to flip it over to dump the dirty diaper.
__label__neg	This Sure Comfort one was a waste of money, in my opinion.
__label__neu	I TRIED THIS AND YET AGAIN THE BABY WAS SOAKED!!! MY POINT OF WRITING ABOUT THIS NOW IN 2005 WHEN I USED THESE BOTTLES IN 2002 IS THAT I CANNOT BELEIVE THIS PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN CORRECTED YET!!! WE THINK WE HAVE ANOTHER BABY ON THE WAY AND I KNOW THAT WE WILL NOT,  NOT,  NOT,  BE GETTING AVENT BOTTLES!!!
__label__pos	At any rate, by 3 months, the doctor said she had improved immensely, we'd just keep an eye on it.
__label__neg	We were a little concerned with finding a monitor that would work for us, because we live in an old Victorian house with plaster walls.
__label__neg	 Right at that moment I knew I had made a huge and very expensive mistake
__label__neg	I bought this in hope of my son will be able to drink milk from this cup
__label__neg	"""Whereas, with other high chairs, the tray has been large enough that we can just move the bowl out of the way."""
__label__pos	He had his first local gorn apple at 5 months old thanks to this product. 
__label__pos	I love how it comes apart becasue it makes it so easy to clean
__label__neg	 DO NOT waste your time or money with this product
__label__pos	She's very durable and easy to keep clean.
__label__neu	I never could use this item and had to revert to using larger blankets until she no longer needed to be swaddled.
__label__neg	They are very thin and my baby felt cold in them.
__label__neg	nice bottle warmer but not fast enough for my baby
__label__neg	I even bought these as part of shower gifts.
__label__neg	if you undo both snaps you are left with a loose elastic band. 
__label__neu	 I had hoped to use this while on a recent trip to canada as strollers are impossible on the snow and ice covered sidewalks
__label__neg	Even the slow-flow nipples were too fast for my 1 week old.
__label__neu	I've never had any wipes get brown or dried out.
__label__pos	The different angles make it versatile.
__label__neu	Plan on buying some for all the new mom's I know
__label__pos	There are many other accessories such as throw pillows, lamp, wall border, wall hanging, mobile, extra crib sheet, etc - that can be purchased separately.
__label__neu	"""One of my cats has taken to clawing at the mat also which is starting to ruin it."""
__label__neu	That was a very poor trade-off in my opinion.
__label__pos	The look of joy on their little faces, once they figure out how to jump, is the greatest thing ever!
__label__neu	I've found the same thing other reviewers did - that you can only get about 12 bags in there
__label__pos	"""We LOVE it!!!"""
__label__pos	Now there is.
__label__pos	We've had this on for over a year now,  and never had any problems with it
__label__neu	Whether you are using these diapers for diapering or for burp cloths, I suggest you look at the version with the padded absorbent center.
__label__pos	"""These Babybjorn bibs beat the pants off regular old flat bibs."""
__label__pos	It's great because she can hold onto it easily and the rattle inside intrigues her, she's always trying to get at it.
__label__pos	I could drop one or two ice cubes in the bag and my daughter would be on cloud nine.
__label__neu	I wish I only had these for bibs. 
__label__neu	As far as I can tell it is like a moby although I have never owned one
__label__neg	I wish it responded to her squeezes.
__label__neu	So i had to pull the tightening belt off to the side,  from which position it refused to tighten.
__label__neg	Be wise,  don't buy it
__label__neu	First, up to about 4 weeks of age, he would lay under it in the 'on' mode - meaning the star played music and lights for about 5 mintues. 
__label__pos	I have used it since I got home from the hospital and my daughter is now 10 weeks old.
__label__neg	The main problem I have is the speed, which is almost as important as the construction of the swing.
__label__neu	Brown's bottles for my daughter. 
__label__neu	My husband and I originally tried the Avent bottles after several recommendations from previous users and after doing some research on our own
__label__neu	You, obviously need to at least rinse the bottles and nipples before putting them in.
__label__neu	you can also attach links with toys the the bar for something for a little one to play with.
__label__neu	I bought this seat when I was pregnant with my second child because I couln't pick up my toddler anymore and because I wanted him to be seated while eating.
__label__pos	When I first started using this product I loved it!
__label__neu	This means a slight resistance to your baby's suckling effort
__label__neg	 Most of all, I hate assembling and disassembling this thing. 
__label__neg	 My daughter is so uncomfortable with this potty trainer
__label__neu	My shoulders feel sore, but my back felt good with some minor adjustment on the lumbar support.
__label__neu	"""It only somewhat keep my baby swaddled."""
__label__pos	I love that it bounces rocks and spins.
__label__neu	The best way to get it clean is to turn it inside out in the wash and then hang it over a chair.
__label__pos	I really like this thermometer.
__label__neg	This didn't help her head from going side to side or even forward.
__label__neg	 The picture looked better, but I was disappointed when I put it together. 
__label__neu	You will have to remove those
__label__pos	A great buy!
__label__neg	baby would begin to suck and would instantly be drownded
__label__pos	"""My daughter is almost 19 months old and cannot get the lid off the cup, but I have heard of children who can."
__label__neu	False advertising!
__label__pos	I got the manual attachment free from the hospital and it is very difficult to use even with the spring loading.
__label__neg	I am extremely tired of having to clean up messes after feeding our twin sons with the Avent bottles.
__label__pos	This pad can be used for anything!
__label__pos	It is wonderful.
__label__neg	I wouldn't recommend if you're trying to child proof from toddlers.
__label__neu	It's been about a month and I haven't gotten my hands dirty yet
__label__pos	It's great for a boy or a girl, so you will get lots of use out of it.
__label__pos	My daughter is six months old and absolutely LOVES this jumperoo.
__label__pos	I have used Born-Free bottles while working as a nanny and never once had to deal with a leak.
__label__neg	I tried to put it together and I could not figure it out!
__label__neu	If you know a friend who has one,  save yourself some cash & borrow it
__label__pos	When it works, it is very clear.
__label__neg	The twist tie design is both clumsy and ineffective.
__label__neu	This is more of a night light,  as the name states,  not a learning toy,  people planning to teach their children about the constellations should look elsewhere.
__label__neg	This seat was recommended to me by someone who owns a caravan and who had luck with it
__label__pos	It reclines and just is wonderful.
__label__neu	I did my fair share of research when I decided to buy a new swing. 
__label__neg	We have given up and bought a diaper champ.
__label__neu	It sings to your child when they sit down and plays a tune when they actually go.  
__label__neu	We received this as a gift and love it!
__label__pos	No problems with sticking.
__label__neu	It also stores alot of toiletries. 
__label__neg	Highly impractical for any vehicle with a leather interior or with a rear seat that folds down in the middle. 
__label__pos	Works well as a travel or back-up stroller
__label__pos	"""She is now 11 months old and still goes in her Jumperoo about a half hour everyday to watch a Baby Signing Time DVD (and so I can take a shower!)."""
__label__neu	I would have preferred a polyurethane waterproofing, but this mattress pad does a good job and appears to be of good quality so far.
__label__neu	This sized blanket can comfortably seat 2 adults with picnic meals.  
__label__pos	This was the only rail we found that would fit our convertible cribs and seems to be safe
__label__pos	Sterility of the bottles and the nipples is ensured by their being stacked,  one on top of the other (think Dixi Cup dispenser).
__label__neu	My only complaint is that the foot-holes need to be just slightly bigger to fit over the sweats she likes to sleep in, but other than that is the answer to her waking up cold at night.  
__label__neu	Also,  baby is always losing his pacifier out of these gaps.
__label__neg	I absolutely HATE this Diaper Genie
__label__pos	Favorite bottle for breasfteeding
__label__neg	 Maybe we can start using it in a few weeks, but for now, I wish I had bought something else.
__label__neu	It is pin drop quiet.
__label__neg	 Now it's back to the disposable pads
__label__pos	"""When our son decides he's hungry, he does not want to wait for the traditional method of placing the bottle in a bowl of warm water."""
__label__neg	My 8 year old cannot lift it.
__label__neg	We didn't have this toy for long because it would not clip onto anything
__label__pos	There is plenty of usable space but it doesn't feel too big.
__label__neg	Thing is that the once warm wipe became cold in approx 3 to 5 seconds,  even if we crumpled it up in the palm of our hands
__label__neu	If you can plan more than a bottle ahead, this might work out better for you, too.
__label__pos	It was inexpensive, less than six bucks, and it was so cute we decided to buy it for our 6-month old.
__label__neu	They suck at the wider part,  naturally
__label__pos	"""Highly recommend and I will definantly be using this for our other babies to come!"""
__label__neu	I have one on my changing table that came with my Pack n Play.
__label__pos	Thank God for this high chair.
__label__pos	"We tried every ""tub"" for newborns out there, then I decided to use this to give my newborn a bath."
__label__neg	 If it says it's compatible with Safeseats, it should allow room for feet in the overlap
__label__neg	We ended up taking the toys off of it and hanging them from other things. 
__label__neg	My only complaint is getting my daughter in and out of it
__label__neu	Do you ever wonder why manufacturers use wall warts?
__label__pos	Just wash the nipple and nipple ring and your ready to go for you next feeding.
__label__pos	A must for parents.
__label__neg	I went with the Avent because overall, I am super impressed with their products
__label__neg	The lid doesn't turn and the blue lip gets stuck
__label__neg	We also had trouble getting it to stick to tables
__label__pos	Never an odor problem. 
__label__neg	 It is at this point that by moving the tub, the suction cups stick to the counter and while moving the tub, it unhooks the clips and out come the waterworks
__label__neu	We purchased three locks and have had two of them installed so far for about two months
__label__pos	 It's just okay now that it's assembled
__label__neu	I bought a MOBY wrap first
__label__neg	I didn't think I was particularly rough on the bag.
__label__neg	The sling is not very good, either. 
__label__neu	First, I have read and tried a lot of the other items out there- the foam mats, slings, tubs.... 
__label__neu	Previously, we had a cheap wood, stationary gate in our hallway.
__label__neg	Eventually I gave up and took dirty diapers straight out to the garage and only used it for pee diapers.
__label__neu	 Is this supposed to support your breasts? 
__label__neu	This carrier has been nice to use when I walk my dog or go shopping instead of bringing a stroller
__label__neg	DO NOT BUY THIS MONITOR
__label__neg	My son sort of hangs over and it looks a little uncomfortable.
__label__neg	The suction cup works but only if you have a place to suction it that your baby can't reach but can see and it doesn't frustrate him to not be able to touch his toys.
__label__neg	This mattress pad/sheet creates an unsafe environment.
__label__neu	He was only a few days old but it didn't seem long enough
__label__neg	sigh)  And the nipple is soft and all but my baby needs to something that he can get a grip
__label__pos	"""We've already gotten our money's worth out of it."""
__label__neu	Our son will not take them luke warm,  he likes them very warm.
__label__neu	All in all good quality but maybe for slightly older kids who know what straws are about.
__label__pos	"""I love this diaper Champ."""
__label__pos	Also,  they can simply grab it an it will automatically turn on to the blue/15min timer.
__label__pos	Also I have found that he doesn't feel as heavy and I can do a lot more.
__label__pos	Easy to use, easy to clean, cheaper to use, not bad-looking either. 
__label__pos	We just had a new baby boy and I feel like a new mother!
__label__neg	 I hope the manufacturer will improve upon this wedge by making it with a material more like memory foam, which would make it softer, but still supportive
__label__neu	We received this graco digital monitor set for a baby shower gift.
__label__neg	 We just use a regualr kitchen trash can now instead!
__label__pos	It seems to fit all kinds and styles of chairs.
__label__neu	My doctor gave me the sad news that I wasnt producing enough milk for my baby and that I would have to supplement after each feeding.
__label__neg	 There is no stuffing where the pillow lies at my stomach so it is useless to support my belly
__label__neu	later!
__label__pos	This is by far one of the nicest LOOKING baby seats out there
__label__neg	The elastic isn't good, and the fabric is just not soft. 
__label__neu	My son used to hate bathtime - turns out he just wanted a little more freedom and mobility.  
__label__pos	The removable cover (zipper) makes this easy to clean (just make sure the velcro is stuck to itself when you wash it or it will stick to all your nice socks.
__label__neu	I returned the  blanket to the manufacturer and got a replacement blanket (which took forever) and it is coming undone too.
__label__pos	In the beginning (1 week-3 month old) I really prefer the Moby Wrap as it's just a simple fabric wrap and the baby is practically skin-to-skin and it's easy for nursing too,  but when the baby is a little older until nearly a year,  I really like the Bjorn (Active carrier best).
__label__neg	I tried everywhere and in all my bathrooms and other surfaces and it just doens't work
__label__pos	THIS ITEM IS GREAT
__label__neg	Before my baby was born I thought I'd love these, but it turns out that I really, really don't
__label__neg	I found that out the hard way.  
__label__pos	Every new mom should have one of these.
__label__neg	Well not for us- we get horrible static reception/feedback despite moving the monitors to several different areas in the house.
__label__neu	The only change to this product I'd recommend is a foam liner where baby sits/lies.  
__label__neu	Maybe when he gets a little older.
__label__pos	Very sweet for a baby.
__label__neg	 I don't get it
__label__pos	"""This is my favorite thing about the bag!"""
__label__pos	Highly reccommend,  no need to make the first potty trips a bowl full of trama
__label__pos	"""The refills are easy to put in and seem to last a while."""
__label__pos	"""Velcro lines the entire bottom of the cover."""
__label__neu	We have only just stopped using it (baby is 4 months) because he has managed to work his fist out to suck and pacify himself each morning,  which I believe is a sign that he's ready to graduate to just a sleep sack
__label__neg	I discovered negative #1 in the store: it uses a giant safety pin (as well as a strap) to attach to the seatback. 
__label__pos	I'd say that is very good!
__label__pos	I really liked getting a carseat that matched the print on our stroller.
__label__neu	It was the most horrifying thing for us so far.
__label__pos	This item is absolutely wonderful!!!  
__label__neg	 Browns instead
__label__neu	In one week I changed the garbage bag at least 4 times.
__label__neg	 If she wasn't on it just right it looked like it would tip over
__label__pos	Fabulous.
__label__neu	This tub comes with a sling that can be used while they are newborn and thenyou can remove it and then use the tub in the other two positions that is made for.
__label__neu	The newborn gift set gets you going with all the bottles you will need to start things out plus some for when baby starts getting older.
__label__neu	This one?
__label__neg	 Pretty much everytime we use it there is a nice milk ring or water ring on the table. 
__label__pos	Overall, we like this cover, especially for it's cost.
__label__pos	I'll positively be back.
__label__neg	3) LEAKS!
__label__neu	It's true that our son loves warm wipes when we use the cold ones he usually is very startled and throws his arms out he also is more likely to pee during a change which isn't fun either.
__label__pos	I have 3 of these and have used them for just over a year
__label__neg	Ideal if your baby sits perfectly still at a diaper change,  but my baby never did
__label__pos	"I also bought ""The Ultimate Swaddling Blanket"" and it was just ok - these are much bigger and more useful."
__label__neu	In retrospect though,  I wish I had saved my money.
__label__neu	I recommend anyone investigate those first
__label__neg	 The nail fillers are way TOO ROUGH too
__label__neg	Troubles started when he was an infant, his little body squirmed all over and I had to wrestle to keep his head up and not falling into the water and body from sliding. 
__label__neg	They were small,  thin,  punctured easily,  and those twist ties (although pumping directly into the bag is a great concept) were just a pain in the butt
__label__neu	I had placed this set on my registry because I knew I wanted to pump my supply to bottle feed.
__label__neg	the plastic feels cheap too. 
__label__neu	The bottom of the chair sits an inch or two above the sink or tub- so in order to have the baby in any water, you need to fill up the sink quite a bit.
__label__neg	At 6 weeks when we tried again it fit around well, but if he straightens his legs it's too short and comes off his shoulders, freeing his arms.
__label__neg	They don't seem to stick very well
__label__pos	"""it was so hard to use and caught her hands once, making her cry."""
__label__neu	Now that my daughter is in her crib at night I moved this downstairs to let her sleep in during the day. 
__label__neu	So I take a receiving blanket and tuck it in all around her under the sleep positioner mat, so it makes it very hard for her to kick off the covers!
__label__pos	I haven't had to purchase them, but I am really glad to know that they are available, should some part need to be replaced.
__label__neu	My daughter had a fit when i tried to feed her
__label__pos	I love that it turns off on its own, so I don't have to remember to do it.
__label__pos	The Moby is one long peice of fabric that both my husband and I can use so we only have to carry one sling with us when we're out and can EASILY switch it back and forth between us.
__label__neu	I got the Avent Isis as a hand-me-down from my sister-in-law, who did not care for it at all.
__label__neu	It can actually be used as a walker, and it is cute, but we are certainly taking this back.
__label__pos	"""i use the smallest one everyday to pack my daughter's snacks like diced fruit or veggies."""
__label__neg	** **Look at 2nd picture (not purple one) this is the potty seat I am writing this review about, not sure how this purple one comes up
__label__neu	The first one we took with us on vacation and the video monitor screen failed.
__label__neu	HOWEVER: when the music/vibration unit at the bottom of the seat is removed, the metal rack it attaches to sticks out, right in the path of my son's little feet.
__label__pos	Yes, its battery operated but seems to get its money worth and in between my two children we loaned it to four different friends and its still in great condition (removable/washable cover).
__label__neg	Slides do not bind, and while they add a small thickness of plastic between the plug and outlet, do not prevent secure insertion of the plug.
__label__neu	(He is one week old)The only problem I have is that I cannot find an adapter that will fit my avent pump and fit these bottles to pump directly into them which makes the avent bottles a little more convenient with breastmilk and playtex doesnt make a hand pump.
__label__pos	He quickly learn how to work it and he still loves to play with it at 20 months old.
__label__neu	"""Thank heavens she was starting to sleep in her room, else she would be in bed with us every night, which I am not too keen on."""
__label__pos	I guess these bottles would work if you plan on bottle feeding a toddler with big hands
__label__neg	"""The cost of producing these has to be infinitesimal."""
__label__neg	Please look elsewhere - DO NOT recommend
__label__pos	"""We have had absolutely no problems with it."""
__label__neg	 I don't know
__label__neg	 It is not a perfect seat because it is not flat but our kids do not mind it a bit and we find it much easier to use
__label__pos	I had some of these that came with my Medela pump and like some other reviewers I thought they would be a good deal since I've really liked my Medela pump
__label__neg	I don't recommend this product.
__label__neg	 Won't be buying another.
__label__pos	I guess that is the one reviewed by consumer reports and recommended.
__label__pos	We've had no problems with safety issues.
__label__pos	"""It's a great little gadget."""
__label__pos	"""The only thing about it I liked was that it didn't hurt my back or neck like other baby carriers."""
__label__neu	You'll need a cross-head screwdriver for the battery compartment.
__label__neu	I can't see the car directly behind me on the highway at all.
__label__neg	 I will not be using this tub for my next child.
__label__neg	I thought this would be great.
__label__pos	"""They are easy to pump directly into."""
__label__neg	 The ironing sort of worked although they still roll up a little around the edges
__label__neg	We bought this wipes warmer for our son's room and it was awful
__label__pos	It was easy to install.
__label__neg	 it flowed too slow for him. 
__label__neu	Nuby makes other two handled sippy cups that are made of safe polypropylene plastic.
__label__neu	Also, there's a little card pouch to fill out with your child's medical information in case of an accident so emergency personel can immediately treat your child!
__label__neg	 Sorry Boppy
__label__neg	The clamps snap shut and are way too loud
__label__neg	It got to the point where I felt that it was dangerous to keep trying so I got rid of it.
__label__neg	"The napper ""hangs"" inside the pack-n-play, so if you take it off and lay it on the floor, it loses its shape. "
__label__neu	The babysitter had to spoon feed milk to her. 
__label__pos	This is supposed to be made to be chewed on
__label__neu	I absolutely could not get the 4 oz liners to hold 4 oz or the 8 oz liners to hold 8 oz.
__label__pos	You can't go wrong with this one - it's just really cute and comfortable.  
__label__pos	This bouncer has bought us and our daughter hours of sleep already, and she is only 9 days old!
__label__neu	"""I used the Avent bottles for expressed breast milk; the #1 stage nipple took my daughter 45 minutes to finish and the #2 stage nipple took her only 15 minutes but she had horrible gas pains after the feeding."""
__label__pos	"""It is super easy to install with either latch or seatbelt."""
__label__pos	thank heavens. 
__label__neu	The channels all seem to give the same result
__label__pos	Finally we tried Dr. Brown's and literally overnight our cranky little man turned into a sweet baby who slept normally and cried only when hungry or tired or poopy.
__label__neg	"""As time passed she was not entertained for long."""
__label__pos	Now she uses the regular bath part and loves it.
__label__neg	 Then cause of the folding gap, water poured out with every movement he made, no matter how little water I put in it
__label__neg	 The waterfall is not as cool as I expected and the music or sounds weren't all that impressive
__label__pos	I tried on 4 different brands of carriers in the store and the 2 I found I liked were the Baby Bjorn and this one.
__label__neg	 Most newborn outgrow swaddling that in my opinion it is not worth buying this product in the long run
__label__neu	Also,  I thought each instrument would play its own melody,  how it would in a real orchestra.
__label__pos	"""And I feel safer using it than the old types of seats since this one attaches to the side instead of being in the tub where there is a risk of it tipping over."""
__label__pos	They replaced it free of charge
__label__neg	In this case...you can!
__label__pos	This is the ONLY small portable pump on the planet for me.
__label__neu	"ALSO,  THE WIPES ARE COLD ALMOST INSTANTLY SO YOU HAVE TO MOVE VERY FAST TO GET THE EFFECT OF A ""WARM"" WIPE."
__label__neg	 How pathetic is that
__label__neg	Parts made no difference. 
__label__pos	"""The instructions are clear and are helpful (I noticed a review that a woman rolled the dough too thin, but the directions clearly say not to."""
__label__neu	I had been using the Gerber bags for quite a while when I ran out and decided to try some of the Medela bags that came with my pump
__label__neg	Buy something safer
__label__pos	I got one as a gift and it was smaller than the Jitter Bug and I had a hard time getting my son in and out of it.
__label__neg	Spend your money on a better bottle like Dr
__label__pos	A++ times a million.
__label__neu	I think, since its plastic rubbing plastic it just makes the noise after awhile you pump.
__label__neg	"""The ony thing I changed was instead of the brightly colored plastic thing that spins going face up, I put it so it faces where she can see it."""
__label__pos	I know I thought I would, but not everything works out as you plan.
__label__neu	Plus it came apart in many pieces and had lots of spots bacteria could hide.
__label__neu	Then baby wants to flip it up or take it off.
__label__pos	It took us about 15 minutes to install with LATCH.
__label__pos	"""I do like the double zipper on Lansinoh, but with the Medela, all you need to do is check the seal by squeezing milk upward."""
__label__neg	The curve drove me batty because this pillow did not eliminate the need to toss and turn, just made it harder.  
__label__neg	"""I thought maybe the speeds were backward, so I put it on the last speed, and it was insanely fast."""
__label__pos	And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space.
__label__pos	"""We weren't going to use this on a car seat but we were going to hang it over the crib from a wire shelf (I know that sounds strange, but it was the perfect little device)."""
__label__pos	That's the biggest selling point for me.Also, the fabric is wonderful.
__label__neg	I wish that it played a few more songs.
__label__neu	Would I buy this seat again? 
__label__neu	The people who are expecting this to be something more than it is need to understand that the toy wasn't designed for their enjoyment.  
__label__neu	I disliked the sling in the tub.
__label__pos	We LOVE that it is so soft and accomodates up to 25 pounds.
__label__neu	I was concerned about getting this bundle me blanket because I thought that it would be too hot for Southern California weather, especially living by the ocean. 
__label__neg	It was difficult to buckle around him and several times he moved enough to hang his head over the side.
__label__pos	"""After reading reviews before registering when I was pregnant I crossed my fingers and registered for this monitor."""
__label__neu	 The packaging does not indicate that it will work, it does not list Hygeia at all.
__label__neg	I immediately freaked out thinking someone broke into the house and was in the baby's room. 
__label__neg	 While having the ability to customize your pillow style is nice, the added expense for an average product almost negates the pros
__label__pos	I love these for late night pumping if my child doesn't wake up.
__label__neg	 They only need to be washed in very hot soapy water
__label__pos	Indispensible, Portable and Affordable
__label__neg	 Graco SafeSeats are compatible with this stroller, which are supposed to last around a year or up to 30 inches
__label__neg	It doesn't really fit very well and is hard to get in place.
__label__pos	The charger is great too because you can use it plugged in,  or charge it so you can take it with you wherever you go
__label__neg	They set them out on a countertop to straighten the folds out and the cheap vinyl odor was still so bad it dominated any room they were in.
__label__neg	This swaddler never fit our son so that it kept his arms in well enough to work.
__label__neu	He loved it.
__label__neg	It sorta looked like his head was attached to a bag of angry kittens
__label__neu	I can force it on without strangling him,  but it's clear that he hates it because it's not comfortable.
__label__pos	The bulb syringe works better than the one from  Gerber that I have and the thermometer was a cinch to use as well.
__label__neg	 As much as I love Avent bottle's anti-gas design, the nipple was too wide at the base and milk would squirt out of the corner of my baby's mouth constantly
__label__neu	I haven't used the night light yet, but I may in the future.
__label__pos	Besides that, its very conviencent to use and easy. 
__label__pos	I highly recommend this pillow to ANYone who has difficulty sleeping.
__label__pos	I also like how the bottle comes apart so that you can clean it well
__label__pos	"""It makes nursing so much easier!!"""
__label__pos	I haven't had any problems with the warmer burning on the bottom, like I have read in other reviews. 
__label__pos	 Carter's also makes lap pads that are great for use over the changing pad. 
__label__pos	"""We got this one cuz the awful splash gaurd that is on most pottys is REMOVABLE!!"""
__label__neu	I can't comment on that because we have only had it for 2 months.
__label__pos	"""At first I thought these would be a dud, but as my son has gotten older, he has started enjoying them more."""
__label__neg	 Brown but ended up going back to Playtex Nursers(I used these with all my other kids) I wouldnt recommend these
__label__neu	To make things short,  I'll say this
__label__pos	This swing is perfect for a boy or girl.
__label__neg	Don't waste your money.
__label__pos	A MUST for a summer baby
__label__pos	But my baby has no problem with that.
__label__pos	I have had lots of people comment on just how comfortable it looks.
__label__neu	Then my daughter was born, I would change her diaper and she would cry, and wet herself each time a chilly wipe would touch her backside. 
__label__neg	It isn't great for infants that are nursing
__label__neu	I am nervous that after months of taking it off and putting it back on that it will become loose and not stay on as well.
__label__pos	He's loved to watch the lights come on and off andhas loved the fish mobile.
__label__neu	Perhaps it does fit some babies, but ours is pretty average in terms of size.
__label__neg	This cover won't slip onto our spigots that have a shower pull-up handle
__label__neu	I also tried the Dr. 
__label__neu	Much cheaper than other products,  but for around $18 all you're really getting is a 't'-strap that connects to the seat and around your carry-on luggage,  which probably cost 50cents to make
__label__pos	This has been the best bath investment we made for our son!
__label__pos	I have a three and a half month old son and this is a miracle when putting him to sleep. 
__label__neg	I found that several babies are injured like this every year. 
__label__neu	My son did have gas problems but after these bottles the problem fanished!
__label__neg	We tried the tri-cut and again he got frusterated so i ripped the cut a little bigger and that works so I went and got the fast flow.
__label__neu	Maybe a bigger child could use this (MAYBE,  but doubtful),  but my 1 year old hates it.
__label__neu	The swing does move quite quickly,  also
__label__neg	 If using these items make sure you always have a warm wipe because your little one gets use to the warm wipes which is not always so convenient when your on the go or traveling. 
__label__neu	It will tip over the circular formation is the sturdiest.
__label__pos	"""My daughter has enjoyed it through many stages."""
__label__pos	"""Just one more element for entertainment."""
__label__pos	So far the return process to amazon has been very smooth and easy.
__label__pos	Easy to write on in pencil and erase (to know which batch comes first
__label__neu	Many of the negative reviews seen to focus on the hump in the middle, and it must depend on the relative size and muscle development of the child. 
__label__neg	They are flimsy like another reviewer said. 
__label__pos	"""Well I actually read from the site that the Diaper Genie was good and bought it."""
__label__neg	Second, if we use it as illustrated, we will have to remove the guard before each using in order to get the little disc drawer to open.
__label__neg	Also it's very awkward to get in and out of.
__label__pos	"""Now, I can hold and rock my daughter comfortably while she eats without worrying about nodding off and upsetting the mood."""
__label__neg	the comb's edge is very sharp.
__label__pos	anything and everything i have ever bought from them has been top notch! 
__label__pos	We prefer to leave our on at all times (even when our children don't need the cabinets locked anymore) because they are easy to turn off (just a flip of the red tab inside the cabinet) that way they are there whenever you have little ones visiting your home.
__label__neu	My son is now 10 months old and recently one of the springs broke,  which completely gets rid of the supposed &quot;odor-free&quot; feature (which I found wasn't exactly true either).
__label__neg	I spent over an hour,  trying to get it to stay up,  but each time I let go the darn thing would fall right off
__label__neg	The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is the amount of space it takes up.
__label__neg	IT IS LOUD!!! 
__label__neg	 The latches to open the different compartments are very snug, making it difficult to open them quickly or with only one hand
__label__neg	 If I could, I would purchase an electric pump, because as my baby grows, I don't see how I'd be able to catch up to her growing appetite using this pump, and not spend my whole day in the bathroom pumping
__label__neu	 I have a My Brest Friend at home and in my car for going out. 
__label__neg	My wife bought a bunch because they were (for a time) the only BPA-free bottles she found (frankly didn't look that hard)They are decent bottles yes,  but there is this extra pair of pieces which you have to assemble
__label__pos	It was named #1 by American Baby this year.
__label__pos	I own the papasan swing so I went out and bought the seat thinking it would be equally good.
__label__neg	I can't comfortably move the front seats forward any more than they are.
__label__neu	maybe i am not that famililar with pump products
__label__neu	Way cheaper
__label__pos	This swing really does all that it offers.
__label__neg	 I'd add that the plug leaks, which is more than an inconvenience. 
__label__pos	Washes well and never shrunk for me.
__label__neu	I used to use the Avent pads until I discovered the Lansinoh pads.
__label__neg	 But when she would tilt it back all the water would just soak her neck and shirt. 
__label__neu	as long as he goes in the potty
__label__pos	This car seat worked out well for us.
__label__neg	It doesn't lock out odors either.
__label__pos	She has done well with these since birth (she is now 9 months).
__label__neg	I'm glad this product has worked for others,  but for me,  it was an expensive and failed experiment
__label__neu	I bought this in hopes that I could avoid standing over a pot of boiling water in the middle of the night to heat my newborn's bottle.
__label__neu	We used it lots when we were out, especially when he was potty training and just couldn't wait.
__label__neu	The first time you use the tray, it seems to work great - until the tray is pulled off. 
__label__pos	She doesn't like it when we don't have it with us and she has to lay on my boney arm!
__label__neg	 I've tried baking soda, bleach, dryer sheets, vinegar-you name it, we tried it
__label__neu	"""The picture quality was poor and it was always staticy."""
__label__pos	"""It was only $20 so I figured if it worked even half as well as the GRACO it would be okay."""
__label__pos	"""Our daughter can't sleep without it now :)"""
__label__neu	I also use them to store home-made baby food, pudding, etc!
__label__pos	"""We're so use to hearing that static noise that my husband and I keep testing it to make sure it's working since it's so quiet and static free."""
__label__neu	We have a the NoJo Jungle Babies 6-piece crib set as well as the wall stickers and these hangings.
__label__neg	I based my decision to purchase this pump based on all the reviews it got
__label__neu	When I returned home from giving birth to my son, he stopped latching on well, so I pulled out my new electric pump and went to work
__label__neg	Then adjust for the suitcase again
__label__pos	He also loves the mirror and the mobile he pays attention for long stretches of time.
__label__neg	I have C-cup and I found that the fit was terrible.
__label__neg	It's absolutely impossible to maneuver your baby into the seat WITH the mobile bar attached without hitting your child in the head/face with the hard molded plastic mobile toys.3. 
__label__neu	((Side note. the Sterilizer is a MUST HAVE item!))It's nice to have a place to warm the bottle and it does cut down on wasting water (vs the other method of a bowl of warm water).
__label__neu	It seems like a great concept,  but it is really just a waste of [money].
__label__pos	I love this stroller seat.
__label__pos	I felt sooo relaxed.
__label__neg	Since the Especially For Baby one seemed a reasonable price,  we experimented with it.
__label__neg	I would also caution parents with babies who are just starting to use sippy cups that this is not a great one to start with.
__label__neg	What a nightmare to collapse
__label__pos	Everything else in the set was used and I even bought an additional matching blanket.This set is wonderful for a boy or a girl.
__label__neg	The wood is completely unfinished and it comes with manufacturing dust on it
__label__neg	There is not much difference between the loudest and softest volume. 
__label__neg	 Also, I have read it is not great to carry an infant hanging by his/her crotch with the feet dangling
__label__pos	Any trash bag will do.
__label__neu	M
__label__neu	Before this swing my son only slept well when he co-slept with me.
__label__neu	The thing that really turned me off to it was when when it came out of the microwave,  it had this plastic smell to it.
__label__neu	 So I am going to guess that it has petroleum products in it. 
__label__neg	And the toys - and what they are attached to -  were always out of her reach,  but in her line of sight
__label__neg	This rack leaves alot to be desired to say the least.
__label__pos	Though once you figure that out everything else is okay.
__label__neu	It is very easy to open and I wonder about my son getting in it as he gets older.
__label__pos	Not only is the design elegantly simpler (wrap inspired vs. backpack inspired with 80 hooks snaps and buckles) but he loves it.
__label__neu	Brown's bottles,  they have more parts but easy to put together.
__label__pos	He would sleep for hours at a time as long as the machine was on. 
__label__neu	He tried it a couple times & now refuses to use it.
__label__pos	"""Although this product does have good back support, at 6 month now, my son is more than 20 lb."""
__label__pos	Go Go Kidz TravelMate - Black/ Orange
__label__neg	 The camera is kind of a pain, though
__label__pos	I love that this duck is cute but blends in nicely to bathroom decor.
__label__neg	Washing it means having to keep your finger over the hole and hope that you can rinse it fast enough.
__label__neu	"""So I still clip them and then use this to make it smoother."""
__label__pos	"""It's supposed to bounce, but it is so hard for her to pounce in it since it's all plastic and you have to go in a downward motion to get it to bounce."""
__label__pos	"""I bought this wrap based on the praise it received."""
__label__pos	 Only took me a few minutes to put together and has held up well
__label__neu	I found the adhesive came off without marring the paint on my cabinets or leaving behind any residue.
__label__neu	On the other hand, I was so excited to have it for my son (#2), but he would not sit still in it at all. 
__label__pos	"""But I love this product so far."""
__label__neg	 I was given this as a gift when I was in the hospital and when my doctor saw the box he suggested that I return it. 
__label__pos	My sister has one as well and loves it.
__label__pos	I really like the fabric (including soft suede like fabric) and the textured animals on the bed skirt, bumper, quilt & valance.
__label__pos	I also love the fact that they're BPA free so that I can freeze them as well as heat them
__label__neg	 It is much too slow to do anything for a baby and is bulky and ugly and heavy as well
__label__neu	I registered for and received these Medela bags. 
__label__neu	"""bought this for our 2 year old as he has been sleeping in a sleepsack since he was a teeny little guy."""
__label__pos	It is well- made and sturdy; it didn't tip when my son got on or off.
__label__neu	Our newborn uses one side and the older toddler uses the other side.  
__label__pos	I think it's neat that you can add or subtract musical instruments during the song that's playing so your baby can hear what each individual instrument sounds like.
__label__pos	I just love this whole color scheme.  
__label__neg	I recommend anyone investigate those first.
__label__neg	 I thought, based on the reviews, that these would be better than the other cups I'd tried - which had too many parts - but they really aren't
__label__neu	The real problem is that there are too many parts.
__label__neu	But the kids think it's great to rinse under the cascading water
__label__pos	Great entertainer!
__label__pos	 Mine is the inflatable version, which is great - when you take off the cover to wash, you can easily clean the pillow beneith with just a damp cloth. 
__label__pos	I did a lot of research and I don't regret my choice to purchase this one. 
__label__pos	I've tried the two other most popular diaper pails and am happiest with this one.
__label__pos	"""I was tempted to take this monitor back home with me and bring the one I have in my house to Indiana my next visit."""
__label__neu	My baby is only 5 months old but is quite chubby... This bib is already too small for his neck!
__label__neu	Snuggly Ride
__label__pos	"""I have pretty much stopped using my fancy mommy diaper bag and just use my husbands diaper dad backpack."""
__label__neu	Since we have a jeep grand cherokee and he was in the middle of the backseat there was no place to attach it
__label__neg	I had to spend too much time cleaning it weekly
__label__neg	This cover was kind of stiff and I didn't like it
__label__neu	"The one ""add on"" that we put into the kit ourselves was a digital ear thermometer."
__label__neg	 I should have known that at this cheap price that I was going to get junk
__label__neg	My husband and I have to sleep with the monitor in our bed because it seems to be much less static if a person is close to it.
__label__pos	It does come with a strap to actually hook in between the seats and that's a lot easier to use.
__label__pos	Save yourself aggravation and make sure everything that goes down is bundled up neatly.
__label__pos	I tried these pads first after being so happy with other Avent products. 
__label__pos	Finally I could do stuff
__label__pos	"""These covers are fine."""
__label__pos	And when your child is out of diapers, you can use it as a regular trash can to put food or pet waste in.
__label__neu	Every mom thinks they NEED warm wipes
__label__neu	This product sounds like a neat idea (especially to first time parents),  but at the best it's pretty unnecessary and at the worst you'll end up with a flood in your house.
__label__neu	 If so, it's in the wrong place. 
__label__pos	 It keeps her busy for up to an hour before she starts fussing. 
__label__pos	My boy loved this rocker from about 1.5 months to about 6 months, when he had pretty much outgrown it.  
__label__neg	"""There is no way I could EVER recommend this product."""
__label__pos	I have owned my sippys for about a year now and just love them
__label__neu	I purchased the 'rest assured' sleep postioner for one of our twins girls & was given this 'inclined to sleep' from a friend, so decided to use that for our other twin girl.
__label__pos	It's non-skid surface really helps hold baby in place, and it's size makes it very easy to bathe your baby. 
__label__neu	Maybe I'll like this product better when  my baby is a little bigger.
__label__pos	Because of the portable motor you can actually pump in your car or even at the movie theatre(if you really want to the point is it's practical.
__label__pos	The buttons that make the animal sounds are her favorite.  
__label__neg	I thought (prior to having my baby) that I would need reminding of how long it had been since he was changed, fed, put down for a nap, etc...which turned out to be completely not true.
__label__neg	Additionally, the lid goes on secure but is not liquid tight.
__label__pos	"""I was able to wean her to the breast in less than a day after using the pump."""
__label__neu	They should do the trick for those using cloth diapers.  
__label__neu	I'm ordering two today: One for each car so dad and I can cut down on the contagion we battled this last year.
__label__neg	The spout is too small. 
__label__pos	This is a baby that wants to constantly be held but he will happily play in his bouncer for 10 or so minutes at a time.
__label__neu	She would always duck her head and end up getting it into her eyes.
__label__neu	"""I could live without it though which is why I didn't give it 5 stars."""
__label__pos	 At first, I loved it. 
__label__neu	"""He wasn't left on the sofa."""
__label__pos	I highly recommend this product and the entire zanzibar line!
__label__pos	He loves to look at the mirror and the bird/bugs/leaves as they move around.  
__label__neu	I'm giving it 2 stars just because they worked well for my sister who does not leak as much as I do
__label__neg	I was not impressed with these storage bags
__label__neg	 They are extrememly soft (you'll wish your sheets were made out of this stuff
__label__pos	I would definitely recommend buying this product...
__label__neu	When she got older she didn't want her feet confined, but when she was little, these were great for cold winters.
__label__neg	 Every time I have used this the rubber pops out
__label__neg	It leaked all over the place. 
__label__neg	Setting #2 was all I could use for a long time b/c it moved so fast
__label__neu	It is not one of those battery operated toys.
__label__neu	IT IS.
__label__pos	"""She has so many places to chew and she is the perfect size for my little one's hands."""
__label__neg	Save your money.
__label__neg	she was wiggling and moving too much to use the pillow part
__label__neu	And I did not notice it untill I tried to replace it so I already opened the origianl refill and some how broke the darn thing.
__label__pos	The fabric in the seat is very easy to wash and the colors haven't faded at all.
__label__pos	We use huggies wipes and don't mind opening the whole lid (it's not difficult) and water doesn't go out like some other parents comented but the water does go back down to the bottom which is nice.
__label__neg	I am not too impressed with this product
__label__neg	That's not what I received
__label__pos	Eventually had to remove it from the stroller because the bottle was about to fall off.
__label__pos	 I was told that nipple shields could be helpful for this
__label__pos	And it comes in lots of great patterns, that are modern and not matronly.
__label__neg	 The terry used for these is very cheap and scratchy, like an old towel. 
__label__pos	It is utterly safe, sturdy, and reassuring to toddlers.
__label__pos	This isis breast pump set is great. 
__label__pos	I must recommend the tri-flow
__label__neu	And he slides down it
__label__neg	 Unfortunatley, breast milk always got between the suction and the funnel (which enables the breastpump to pump)
__label__pos	 The denser sponge on this brush also lathers the inside of the bottle much better than other brands too, which means cleaner bottles in less time. 
__label__pos	I bought it because I liked the idea of it growing with my baby.
__label__neu	This is the worst pad I have tried.
__label__pos	"""They stopped her spitting up and gas almost instantly and she is now coming off of her medication."""
__label__neg	I have no idea why it got such positive reviews.
__label__neu	Also!
__label__neu	Your mileage may vary.
__label__neu	All in all,  I will give this tub another chance once my son gets older and can sit up but if it still leaks,  I am getting another one.
__label__neg	I'm not sure what the fuss is surrounding this product and why so many deem it a 'must-have'  I find that a regular firm pillow works just as well if not better. 
__label__neu	We purchased this toy when my son was 3 weeks,  prior to buying the swing.
__label__pos	This playyard is really bright and gorgeous and the mesh is clear so baby can see out.
__label__pos	I LOVE this sheep!
__label__neu	A straw is included to make the holes at the top for the ribbon.
__label__neg	"""I hated how I had to unplug it and plug it in every time I wanted to use it."""
__label__pos	These bottles are great for babies who don't need any more air in their tummys.
__label__neg	"""NO!"""
__label__pos	From that perspective it is a great product
__label__pos	My son and I love it.  
__label__neu	I ended up throwing it out and just getting some toys that connect to the car seats handle.
__label__pos	It's fabulous!
__label__neg	After my husband and I put this together using the TERRIBLE directions,  we've been using this as a free-standing bassinet for the past 5 months (not attached to the bed,  as some people do
__label__neu	The bar above can get in the way and you have to put the baby in a specific way to keep the head form bumping into it
__label__neu	He makes lots of noise while he sleeps, so a quick glance at the monitor lets us know if he needs us or is just being his typically loud-sleeping self.
__label__pos	At the risk of sounding like an infomercial or planted endorsement I have to say this was our all- time best investment for our baby.
__label__pos	My daughter is tall so this seat was perfect for her and will fit her until she's 65 lbs.
__label__neg	The sling they give you isn't so great for a newborn either my little one slid down and rolled side to side and he appeared to be very uncomfortable.
__label__neg	The bottle brush is an inconsequential addition.
__label__neu	"""I wish it were a bit smaller, but I suppose its size accommodates large bottles."""
__label__neu	"And to Todd Peterson ""tmphuskers"" who was/is cutting after each diaper...um...you don't do that."
__label__pos	"""The reason I think the Boppy is a must have is because you will be using it a lot when your baby starts tummy-time and it is also great for when they are almost sitting down by themselves."""
__label__neg	It really doesn't attach well to the car seat or stroller
__label__pos	The colic stopped within the week and we have notlooked back.
__label__pos	"""Finally, and perhaps most important of all: this is an essential piece of baby gear."""
__label__neg	Kind of acts like a slide.
__label__pos	I only use these bottles, my daughter would not take any other ones right from the start. 
__label__neg	 I'm especially irked because I live in the Middle East and paid all this money to have it shipped here and it doesn't even work
__label__neu	I gave it a 2 since it is stylish & I hope it works in a few weeks when my son can hold his head up and he can sit in it...we'll see. 
__label__neg	These sheets are incredibly thin and cheap. 
__label__neu	Also, it's pretty clunky and large, so once it's up, we keep it up. 
__label__neg	I found it to be a bit hard so I purchased a little pad and cut it to fit.
__label__neu	I keep it in my diaper bag at all times!
__label__neu	But I prefer Lansinoh and that is what I use now even at nights.
__label__pos	Nonetheless,  it's a nice feature
__label__neg	I had another model of this same product for my first child and it worked okay,  so I got another one for my upcoming second child
__label__pos	"""only thing i don't like is on the 24hr setting it beeps every 6hrs when it runs again."""
__label__neu	A friend of our has a daughter about the same age as our son who wouldn't take naps.
__label__pos	Well worth the money
__label__pos	I don't like things hanging on this crib so I liked that this machine can be put anywhere.
__label__pos	"""We've only had the thermometer for a month and it has performed flawlessly."""
__label__neu	Update
__label__pos	I just love these. 
__label__neg	 We only have motor issues
__label__pos	It ONLY took me between 5-10 minutes to unhook it from the car
__label__neu	I have had friends buy one because they have seen me use mine
__label__neu	I wasn't real sure if he would use it.  
__label__pos	It is lightweight but sturdy with a padded shoulder that works for everyone!
__label__pos	This swing is helpful in that it provides some down-time after a lot of playing  and allows Mom to get a few things done around the house too.
__label__pos	Great for breastfeeding beginners!
__label__neg	The comforter part is kind of impractical, but great as a decoration.
__label__neg	"Another issue is that although our baby meets the height/weight requirements, she doesn't meet the ""seated shoulder height"" requirement."
__label__pos	They were great before.
__label__pos	Other than that, it's a great swing. 
__label__neg	The Avent comes with a little clip on cover, these do not so they are inconvenient to travel with.
__label__neg	The reason I say I have to be fair is it is very likely that she seems bored with this one because the jumperoo is totally pimped out.
__label__neg	They absorb a great amount of formula since my son is quite a dribbler and they wash wondefully.
__label__neu	 All together a rating of 3 stars.*
__label__pos	This is a great gift and truly a life- saver.
__label__neu	 They told us to have him sleep w/ us
__label__pos	I've washed both a cotton and a fleece sleep sack dozens of times and they held up great.
__label__neg	 It also didn't feel as comfortable as what other reviewers wrote about
__label__neg	My son outgrew his small once, so I've ordered a larger one.
__label__pos	This crib is very nice, and it's cheaper (plus free shipping) ordering it here on Amazon than at BabiesRUs. 
__label__pos	We have had no problems with these bottles.
__label__neg	We had no idea which monitor to register for & picked this one b/c it had two receivers and was reasonably priced.
__label__neu	The only problem we had with the sling, was our son did seem suspended too high--but we just added more water, so that the tub was full to the brim.  
__label__neu	It will beep and the range alarm will light up.  
__label__neu	My 1 year old turns this on himself to hear the music and watch the birds move around.  
__label__neg	But it can slide a little if your child puts their weight on it.
__label__neg	On the down side, it is a bit expensive for a swing, but then there are those other extra options you pay for.
__label__pos	My baby enjoyed these very much.
__label__neu	I REALLY AM HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT EXCEPT HAVING TO PUT THE COVER BACK ON IT AFTER WASHING. 
__label__pos	The tray is dishwasher safe and the whole seat is very easy to clean without troublesome nooks and crannies to trap caked on baby food.
__label__neg	For some reason,  the removable bee made her cry on instant.
__label__neg	Update: We tried the sticky tape and it stayed for about a week and fell again.  
__label__neg	Now this bottle is very difficult
__label__neg	The bags never fit right and then it never spun right.
__label__pos	It really does seem very well constructed and my son LOVES it!
__label__neu	After trying multiple times to copy the amazing nurses at the hospital, I gave up on my swaddling attempts. 
__label__neu	The Sweet Peace is really nice but if you can try it out before you invest $$ since it doesn't work for every baby.
__label__pos	"My 13 month old son loved the tags when he was younger, now he loves playing ""catch""."
__label__neg	I returned the warmer and found the PERFECT warmer at a TARGET store. 
__label__neu	We will see if this holds true later when the baby grows.
__label__neg	 He didn't mind carting it around once in a while, but after a while he began to protest that he was always carrying a purse around
__label__neg	 I average 2-3 ounces every hour and half
__label__pos	Not to mention VERY easy to clean!
__label__pos	"""my daughter just loves how it feels."""
__label__neu	We were able to get one out,  but not the other
__label__neu	The rainforest swing on the other hand sounds very good.
__label__neu	I dislike that the screws are not better constructed into the gate and the plastic that is used to extend them is not that strong,  mine stripped under the presser.
__label__neg	I've seen so much better built cribs for less money,  just not as pretty
__label__pos	"""Baby is not nearly as gassy since we switched to these bottles."""
__label__pos	 The brush works well and cleans both the bottom and the neck of the bottle. 
__label__pos	"""I did feel like the wood was going to crack at times, as in some places it must be strained to fit together while you tighten the screws, but it held up in the end, and is actually much sturdier than it looks like it is going to be when you take it out of the box."""
__label__neu	But they couldn't use the ABC shape sorter by themselves... they always needed help.
__label__pos	"""What a lifesaver they have been!"""
__label__neu	"After searching online and in many retail stores at malls, Target, Babies and Toys 'R Us and Walmart, I was only finding these gauze type ""cloth diapers""."
__label__neu	I suggest that if you still want this product after reading the reviews, you try to find it used so that you don't have to pay retail.
__label__pos	She is now 5 months old and still loves it.
__label__pos	If they've got a microwave, then you're ready to go.It's also very durable.
__label__pos	I am not sure how long he will fit into it, but I love its portability and how I feel there is no rush to move my happy 2 yr old out of his crib.
__label__pos	The car seat clicks right in.
__label__neg	what if your little one happens to make a mess,  that board is going to turn to mush
__label__neg	 The material is rough and cheap. 
__label__pos	Once he started sitting up he still likes laying down and playing in it as well as sitting on the mat and playing with the toys.
__label__neu	helpful for tummy time - forces him to work on his neck muscles since the center is dipped in but the pillow supported his check and pelvic areaeh
__label__pos	"""I just got these in the mail today and I am so excited to try it."""
__label__pos	I set up a playdate with a friend of mine and she let my son use her jumperoo He fell in love He was jumping up and down and shaking the toy!
__label__neu	Our floorplan is very open so we don't have doorways in which to hang a jumper.
__label__pos	The mixing mechanism in this pitcher has eliminated all of the lumps in the formula and has made the whole bottle feeding experience MUCH easier.
__label__pos	"""I have yet to use this bag, but I think it's a marvellous design and will attach it soon to my stroller, once the weather warms up."""
__label__neu	I recommend trying it out at the store before purchasing.
__label__neu	I my research before purchasing a thermometer before my baby was born.
__label__neu	I now just use these for storage and then pour the warmed milk into Playtex Nurser bottles.
__label__neg	 Great customer support only goes so far
__label__neu	The wipes stay warm long enough for me to use them - I just make sure to pull out a wipe as I need it.
__label__neg	"""Since then if she doesn't take off the lid, she shakes it upside down to get the Cheerios out and scatters them everywhere that way."""
__label__neg	from a various number of stores
__label__neu	I use these bottles and avent bottles (i have an avent pump)and noticed that with the avent bottles my milk had a horrible amount of bubbles.
__label__pos	"""I can pump an 8-9oz bottle in 10 to 15 minutes with no problem."""
__label__pos	Simple product and inexpensive.
__label__neu	This is a piece of clear plexiglass that is the length of you dvd player and is angled at 90 degrees,  so that you attach velcro (included) to the top of the dvd player and then to the plexiglass and the other part of the clear guard actually protects the buttons.
__label__neu	The footprint for the jumperoo is large, but if you have the space, it's a life saver - put on some lively music and it will entertain for a good 30 minutes!
__label__neu	"""When they're real little and have no neck control they have to face your chest."""
__label__neg	You can hear and see the problem
__label__pos	"""Being able to swing front to back or side to side is great, if one doesn't work try the other."""
__label__pos	I also read other reviews about leaking and can honestly say I have never had a single leak.  
__label__neu	Ok,  I'll be honest - we never even got these installed
__label__neu	Hello?
__label__pos	I've tried them all and these are the BEST
__label__neu	This allows a little flap in the valve to open and let air in.
__label__neg	We've suffered through it losing connection and beeping extremely loudly.
__label__neu	"""I have tried both, the Boppy pillow and My Brest Friend."""
__label__neg	 Well it wasnt
__label__pos	We've taken several vacations and it deflates with ease.
__label__neu	THAT USUALLY WORKS BUT SOMETIMES AFTER 2 OR 3 TRIES.
__label__pos	This is a great addition to our already wonderful Uppababy stroller.
__label__neu	The fleece is very soft but not as stretchy as the cotton material which I am able to fasten tighter.
__label__neu	The sides can be taken apart, to make smaller areas.
__label__pos	"""The really nice thing about it is that you can remove the star and attach it to the car seat or stroller for entertainment while out and about."""
__label__neu	I wanted her to recieve all of the benefits of breastmilk so I pumped
__label__neg	So unless your going to be traveling with someone I do not recommend it at all
__label__pos	Good Luck
__label__neg	 It definitely wraps your baby up tight but the way it holds their arms so tightly next to their sides it almost seems like a straight jacket! 
__label__neg	These darken the windows a lot and it is sometimes difficult to see through.
__label__neg	 I wanted to like this diaper, but am very disappointed. 
__label__neg	I think that I've tried every bag that I have found and have been disappointed with all of them
__label__pos	I had no problems at all with these bottles and i would highly recommend them.
__label__neu	My second child is in this one and my first is in his original Cosco one.
__label__pos	"""They are also very easy to clean."""
__label__pos	Great Nightlight!
__label__neg	It was awful
__label__neg	What a perfect place for mildew.
__label__neg	THEY ALL LEAKED.
__label__neu	My husband used it when he just wanted to hold & rock the baby without wearing out his arms. 
__label__neu	Now she crawls over/through it and moves on.
__label__pos	However,  I just wanted to comment that the colour of the blanket is much nicer than the online picture
__label__neu	Our first was a little fussy in her first 5 months or so.
__label__pos	 She likes to scoop up water in it and watch it trickle out from the bottom
__label__neu	If this product actually spun around like a lazy susan,  which I thought it would,  it would have  a much better rating.
__label__neg	Once together it is very flimsy and doesn't seem like it will hold up very long at all
__label__neg	 So i moved it upstairs to the bathtub and this way i don't have to worry about all the leaks
__label__neu	If you are like me, you want the products you buy to do the intended job.  
__label__neg	Her diapers are MUCH different then my 3 month old son though.
__label__pos	I don't know how anyone could choose one of those big, clunky tubs over this.
__label__pos	This is a great bouncy seat.
__label__pos	This product is a must have for late fall/winter babies.
__label__neu	When we first bought our baby home we needed a place to bathe him.
__label__pos	Beats the Genie Hands Down!
__label__pos	"""Even today I give him juice using Avent and my son has no problem switching."""
__label__neg	That's fine, except the velcro is backwards, in my opinion, for the cow.
__label__pos	"""A must have!"""
__label__pos	I didn't realize that the others were making him unhappy,  but he is a different baby since switching to these
__label__neg	 She's accidental sat on it before and it hurt her
__label__neg	I would not recommend this monitor to anyone.
__label__pos	 Luckily for me I was able to return the larger bottles
__label__neu	I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 only because the first set that I bought I had to fix.  
__label__neg	I had it installed at the fire station but had to take out.
__label__neu	If you are concerned about gas use Dr.
__label__neu	For those of you who are trying to decide between this or a more expensive model,  here are my two cents
__label__neg	They don't seem that useful to me.
__label__neu	I still give her her bath in the bathroom, and just sit her tub in the big tub.
__label__neg	 And let me tell you, it isn't easy to remedy this while holding a wet, squirmy baby
__label__neg	Both of my daughters slid right down the positioner.
__label__neu	At least with the harness they get to walk and explore and get some exercise.
__label__neu	I also like that the sling has no pressure points so you can keep your baby in it for as long as you want to
__label__neg	My son also rips these right off the table
__label__neg	The tweezers were so hard to handle,  I just used mine
__label__neg	These cloth diapers are reasonably priced and include a padded middle.  
__label__neu	This was the first 'big' toy I bought for my son. 
__label__neg	Sometimes they leak, other times they don't.
__label__neu	I will stick with this until my daughter outgrows it
__label__pos	The nipples fit securely and I have never had any problems leaking.
__label__pos	"""He only liked this one."""
__label__neu	My wife began taking him into the shower and that worked well too.
__label__pos	"""I would recommend this to other parents."""
__label__pos	"""On top of that, I could see her larger movements with the lights."""
__label__pos	It seems to fit better than the cheaper chairs, plus, as others note, it is elegant and attractive.
__label__neg	The chicco stroller at the beginning seems to be great but after a while as the child gets older and heavier, the flimsy back bends!
__label__neu	It's not the same.
__label__neg	Our 12 week old became so frustrated while using these bottles because the nipples would constantly collapse
__label__pos	"""I actually bought it because my 75 lb labradoodle was jumping over our other baby gate on a daily basis & I wanted to keep him out of our dining room."""
__label__neu	It has stayed since the first day I put it there.  
__label__pos	Makes night-time crib linen changes easy and fast!
__label__pos	They are much larger than traditional receiving blankets, so they can be used for swaddling, as a coverup for nursing, and for shielding the stroller and carseat on really sunny days.
__label__neg	These would not work in our house even as a dish cloth, let alone absorbing any type of baby mess!The only reason I didn't give only a single star is because Gerber was very nice about giving me a refund on these - they guarantee all their products.
__label__neu	My wife bought a bunch of these and matching bottles in the big BPA scare last year
__label__neg	No more cups without lids.
__label__pos	so I choose theseUsed them on 2 healthy kids and loved them
__label__pos	Another great thing about this swing is that it plugs into the wall so I dont have to buy batteries all the time. 
__label__neg	He was just sucking air
__label__pos	Great product.
__label__neg	 The shoulder strap is too narrow, it digs in, and I only had it on for a couple seconds
__label__neg	This product is not versatile nor effective enough for me to recommend it
__label__pos	The one hand open is really simple and I like it more than any gate I have seen at friends houses.
__label__neg	"Too low:  unless your nipples are around your belly button,  you'll keep straining your back and neck to reach your baby--it's impossible to ""bring your baby to your breast"" instead of the other way around with this pillow.  "
__label__pos	The music and sound feature is great too.  
__label__neu	We've packed it carefully back into the box,  and are hoping Target will take it back without a fight.
__label__pos	So having the cosleeper at my level really helped me.
__label__pos	"""This has become my son's comfort object."""
__label__neu	The inspector told us to get rid of it.
__label__pos	After I realized a part was on wrong I would not leave the house without it. 
__label__neg	It's terrible.I sat for about 15 minutes trying to pump either breast & I think I succeeded in getting a drop to appear on one nipple!
__label__pos	This is the first day in almost two weeks that she has fallen so soundly asleep there.
__label__neu	Since these are used for only minutes and then tossed away ,  and never heatedto a dangerous level,  the baby is safe and colic etc
__label__neg	 Our daughter just doesn't like it
__label__pos	Feels like a smooth thick organic cotton stretchy t- shirt.
__label__pos	When my baby was younger and I couldn't get him to go to sleep I would put him in this bouncer with the vibration on & it would put him right to sleep.
__label__neg	They are awful
__label__neu	My 15 month old can hold on to it without getting cold hands.
__label__neg	Definitely not the right latch for your cabinet full of cleaners or medicine.
__label__neu	That said, I would still buy it again.  
__label__neg	"""Although Serta's Organic Contour Pad is free of phthalates and polyurethane foam, it IS treated with harmful flame retardant (see tag on back stating compliance with California law #133) and has a vinyl cover which contains PVC that can leach dangerous chemicals that at low levels to affect reproductive, endocrine and immune systems."""
__label__pos	And what's so special about this one is the wonderful fish-patterned seat (my son almost goes cross-eyed trying to look at it while he's on it) & the captivating activity bar.
__label__neg	It has a white moon and many blue and yellow stars...[...]Hopefully other people will be able to take advantage of this -- I'm not sure how long it will be offered at this price,  but good luck!
__label__pos	"""We purchased it because we enjoy hiking & wanted to bring her along with us."""
__label__neg	 Finally, and MOST disappointing, these leaked more than the previous brand I tried - a lot more
__label__neg	The problem is that I am spending a small fortune in batteries. 
__label__neu	It is smooth and soft and you roll it out using the roller included with the kit.
__label__neg	Didn't even use it once!
__label__neu	and the brush is so hard when you use it.
__label__neg	I pressed and clicked the correct spot like it said in the directions and yet it still leaks
__label__neu	My son never paid attention to the frogs anyway.
__label__pos	"""yes, sometimes the lid is hard to snap but you just have to get the right angle."""
__label__pos	Still a great monitor.
__label__pos	easier to install 2.
__label__neg	And yes battery hogs they are- I think my batteries lasted a day and a half with the monitor being on maybe a few hours each day before they went out.
__label__pos	This was a good thing.
__label__neu	It might not be appealing to some beacuse of its plain look but I keep mine in the corner next to my crib.
__label__neu	 Should have just used a cloth diaper tucked in. 
__label__neu	I'd still recommend the Elite II,  but this product isn't bad for a 2nd diaper disposal unit
__label__neu	But considering that this is an item that you'll need more than one of due to the occasional night-time diaper leak or spit-up,  it pains me to pay full price for them.
__label__neg	I would recommend you research other pottys on the market because this is no good. 
__label__pos	As soon as I heard that I knew I had made a good purchase. 
__label__neu	So for my baby shower I recieved the original re-fill for my wide genie.
__label__neu	We actuly wore out our first one and had to get another.
__label__neu	I hate this toy.
__label__neg	 Won't be wanting to wash them in cold water when they are covered in poo though
__label__pos	Love the fish design and the hammock.
__label__pos	"""My husband brought home one of these Baby Bjorn Carriers and it saved our lives!"""
__label__neg	The mat is so thin. 
__label__neg	They do still tend to spit up and have alot of gas from the other end, so I'm not sure about how much gas these bottles actually reduce.They are rather time consuming to clean because of all the parts.
__label__pos	This was the most useful gift we received for our baby.
__label__neu	My husband says it looks like he has a football in his pants.
__label__pos	(My son slumps in the restaurant ones, but since the tray can be adjusted in and out, it holds him up better (3) adjustable height so he can sit up and see the table
__label__pos	The simple design makes it easy to clean and use.
__label__pos	She laughs out loud at the musical star!
__label__neg	It's not easy enough to get it on and off.
__label__pos	Sturdy, tall, nice to look at and it opens effortlessly.
__label__pos	good walker
__label__neu	 The little notches on the side are baby finger sized and they come right out
__label__pos	"""I bought this for my car - so far I haven't had any problems with suction, etc."""
__label__neg	 It isn't sturdy enough and she wanted off before her business was done
__label__neu	All the nurses tried to help and he'd get on for maybe 2 seconds, we have multiple nursing lactation consultants come in to help and they had no luck. 
__label__pos	Whenever he gets fussy we can switch on the vibrating motion and it calms him for a while longer - at least until we can finish this review!It's one of our best baby purchases and we look forward to using it when he's a toddler.M...
__label__pos	"""This product was very easy to use and required very little effort."""
__label__neu	I ended up buying a Medela when this one conked out even though I'm a stay at home Mom and don't really need to use it very often.
__label__neu	Mabe it's the larger size.
__label__neg	This bottle warmer is definitly not a necessary item
__label__neu	Kudos to them for researching them and clearing that up.
__label__pos	Quality is great and after using this for 6 months, I would certainly buy it again if I were doing it over.  
__label__neg	 It really does sound as though the motor is straining and it will break any minute
__label__neg	For us the Cons outweighed any pros...
__label__neg	The sides do not attach very well to begin with and definitely are not helpful if the baby scoots during sleep
__label__neg	If she did like it,  it would not have lasted very long.
__label__pos	Despite these two issues I still like and use the bag
__label__pos	He loves to hang out in here and play.
__label__neg	The side straps of the diaper will get caught in the shoot so make sure you roll the diaper really tight and use the straps to hold it together otherwise your diaper shoot will get clogged.3.
__label__neu	These clippers need to be off the market!!!
__label__pos	It was comfortable for him and he loved to snooze in it. 
__label__neg	Tried to use it several times but my daughter hated it.
__label__pos	It also seems like a more natural sitting position for a baby especially boys.
__label__neu	My son loves these, but they are horrible from a parent stand point.
__label__neu	The only pumps proven to do that are hospital-grade (which I've used). 
__label__pos	)  At the rate we are going, we won't need to open another box of refills until close to his 6 month birthday.Don't let the price tag worry you - it's WELL worth the price because there is absolutely no odor.  
__label__neg	I do not like these bags.
__label__neu	Another call and another promise to send a case.  
__label__neg	 And I've never been able to tear open the little tab at the bottom to get the milk out - I have to snip the edge with a scissors, which I'm sure defeats the purpose of having a nice, sterile inside
__label__neu	 I contacted the company and they told me all these different tips of assembling the bottles that should stop leakage
__label__neu	The reviews are correct - they won't help with that.  
__label__neg	I am not impressed at all
__label__neu	I bought a few Avent bottles when I was at a grocery store and had to have a bottle RIGHT then and this was all they had.
__label__neu	No doubt this is a great seat, but it isn't made for infants, no matter what the description says.
__label__pos	 The green net comes with the tub is easy to use.
__label__pos	The high contrast spots are visually appealing.
__label__pos	Every parent should have them.
__label__neg	We recently moved into a new house and bought and installed 3 of these gates
__label__neg	 There is also a too-long cord that hangs off of the case, it's really annoying
__label__pos	Just get one of these (actually, I got two so I wouldn't have to keep moving it around so much.)
__label__neg	 I still think wipes warmers are a good idea, just not this one! 
__label__neu	it leaks.
__label__neg	The paint chips off VERY eaisly. 
__label__neg	 We love the stroller and infant seat together, BUT the infant seat base is unable to be installed properly in our Subaru Forester
__label__neg	It does not secure to the toilet, so if the child pulls on the handrail before placing *significant* body weight on the step, he may fall or it could be pulled off-center and slip off the toilet.
__label__neg	 It was glued together
__label__neu	Sometimes it might be difficult to get the suction working correctly especially if you're used to the electric pump but once you do it's incredibly efficient.
__label__pos	So, if you are looking to use them the way we did and find that the gauze type found in most stores to be unacceptable, then get these!
__label__pos	They tack nice and don't take up too much room
__label__neu	"""I am using this for the floor when my son lays down."""
__label__neu	As a result,  changing her sheets is also super easy
__label__pos	Great bottle for breastfeeding, supplementing or formula fed babies
__label__neu	It was ok while my baby was just weeks old,  but once he was 10 and 12 pounds,  I couldn't walk more than a couple blocks without very bad lower back pain
__label__neg	I can't say if it's the particular model or what, but of the two times we tried, it didn't stay on.
__label__pos	The bag is also large enough for him to kick, lift his legs and move freely.
__label__pos	He does like to just chill out in it especially later in the evening as it gets closer to his bedtime.As others have mentioned it does swing very fast even on the lowest setting.
__label__neg	 It's too loud
__label__neg	These bottles look so nice and are so durable BUT they only offer one kind of nipple and are not compatible with any other system, so if you child doesn't like thier nipple, you're heavily invested in a huge set that is useless.
__label__neg	The nipples are fast flow.
__label__pos	Simply a lovely bath safety tool.
__label__neg	:(
__label__pos	When we first brought our baby boy home, my wife bought this Boppy Nursing Pillow and got good use out of it for about the first month. 
__label__pos	It is reasonably priced and works great.
__label__neg	"""This product has no real educational value."""
__label__pos	"""We have used it in 3 different tubs."""
__label__neg	 To my suprise these cups gave me even more work
__label__neu	One last item - in order to adjust the height of the mixing blade you have to take the lid off and push a rubber grommet up/down the shaft.
__label__neu	The motor is pretty quiet.
__label__neg	Enter the Splashmat - we put it under the high chair and gave it a go - but we expected it to be a little tougher and thicker so that we could move a chair on it without it bunching up, and that it would stay flat.  
__label__neu	It easily slides up to the table and we use it with the tray and at times without so he can sit at the table with us.
__label__neg	unacceptable.  
__label__neu	1.
__label__neu	Of course not.
__label__neu	So disappointed.
__label__neu	Yes, I know that diapers stink, but there's no reason for my little girl's entire room to smell like one.
__label__pos	I absolutely recommend it.
__label__neg	 It would be cost effective to buy the items seperately from this company
__label__pos	She fits perfectly in the newborn side, and I feel safe she won't slip down.
__label__pos	"""Instantly he was entranced by the star's lights and music."""
__label__neg	 But I'd skip this one
__label__pos	I put it on my kitchen table after filling under sink, and drain it from the easy-drain spout right into the sink when I am done.
__label__neg	The refills are a little pricey, but a 3-pack lasts several months.
__label__pos	It mixes a really convenient amount of formula does so very well and quickly and with a minimum of added air in the formula.
__label__pos	We switched to the playtex natural latch and everything was much better
__label__neu	Unfortunately I cannnot change my star rating but it would only go up to 2 stars
__label__neg	 I wish I'd bought something else
__label__neu	"""She is little for her age."""
__label__neu	But considering it folds for storage,  that was not a big issue
__label__pos	Good Diaper Pail
__label__neg	It clings to the bib itself and doesn't catch half the food... 
__label__neg	I have owned this set for about 6 months when today my 11 month old son was chewing on the coolin droolin teether in the set and it was leaking the fliud in his mouth
__label__pos	"""I wish I had."""
__label__neg	These worked good for about 3 weeks and they started to leak
__label__pos	I love the material and the design goes great with the stroller and all our other baby things.
__label__neg	The remote is great,  but it requires you to leave the mirror on,  which doesn't allow long battery life
__label__neu	Replacement parts are available for $2 bucks each plus $8 shipping from Combi and then tax so basically if you lose that one tiny piece the cup is useless.
__label__pos	These sheets are so soft, made of jersey fabric.
__label__neg	I read about these when I was pregnant and thought, man, those are some overpriced blankets!
__label__neg	I found my daughter almost fell out of the sling and would have if my hand was on her torso.
__label__neu	THANK GOD I HAVE A DAUGHTER! 
__label__neg	 Not surprisingly, this led to terrible gas and spitting up every time we fed
__label__neg	I guess the diapers have gotten stinkier.
__label__neu	Pros:  I hear it has worked well for some babies, so it can't be ALL bad, right!?
__label__pos	another great feature is it has a groove in the back, where you can use it in a sink, or lean it against something to dry.
__label__neg	But it's so noisy!
__label__neu	The same could be done by just pushing on the backs of these carseats (in the rear-facing position), so baby's face would slam into the back seat in a head-on collision!
__label__pos	In the end, I returned the Chicco, the customer service at BabiesRUs was so great that they gave us a store credit.
__label__pos	"""5.  The mirror is much larger and the lights are more entertaining."""
__label__neu	Finally after 24 hrs one of them recommended this because my poor baby was frustrated and starving.
__label__pos	I recommend it.
__label__neg	Tip it or shake it and you'll have a mess.
__label__neu	It simply doesn't extend tightly against the walls like it supposed to
__label__pos	I love it
__label__pos	 We were excited to hear that they were BPA-free and with our past experience with Playtex bottles, we were happy to purchase these
__label__neg	 The diapers are placed in a plastic hole at the top of the pail, and then they drop through to the bag
__label__neu	I purchased this diaper organizer to hang on my Delta Luv changing table,  because there was no storage space on top.
__label__pos	I absolutely love this product.
__label__neu	 If only Nuby made a PP version of the 2 handled sip n' flip
__label__neg	My daughter screamed whenever she was in it or she made her body very stiff like she was scared beyond belief.
__label__neg	Waste of space and money
__label__neu	"""I recently ordered this for our son."""
__label__neu	It's so hard to find gates that can handle uneven fixture points; this gate should have stuck to that feature alone.
__label__neu	I bought this mirror because of all the great reviews.
__label__pos	Love it!
__label__neg	A local TV channel 3 affiliate here in Ohio ran a story the other day about a couple that had one of these that greatly malfunctioned.
__label__neu	I tried putting the Dr. 
__label__neg	5 months old, and 16 pounds, and the harness straps are extremely tight for her
__label__neu	I only bought 12 of these and that was plenty - I am not a full-time working mom, so it was only to use sometimes when I was at school or working a few days in a row. 
__label__pos	Good but could be better
__label__neg	 My complaint is that the product is flimsy for the price
__label__pos	The timing is perfect since my baby gets distract for awhile than falls asleep and I do not have to worry about turning the music and the mobile off to save some batterie because it does on its own.
__label__neg	 overall, it's a piece of junk. 
__label__neu	Brown's bottles
__label__neu	She's also fearful of the big toilet,  so taking the removable seat off and using the base as a step stool right now is not an option
__label__pos	It's nice to look at it and quickly see how long they have been sleeping, etc.
__label__pos	"""I would say he liked this more than his stroller."""
__label__neu	Have tried 3 different brands now and I liek these the least
__label__neg	These bottles leak so bad it is like they don't even have a top on.
__label__neu	 I had a low milk supply and breastpumping for 1 hour for only 4ounces - this was not a joke
__label__neg	 But, once your baby reaches 23 inches or so, her feet will be completely smooshed up against the seat in front (the seats overlap, and there is no room for feet under the overlap)
__label__neg	It folds up and can be rolled on it's wheels even when folded.
__label__pos	The nipples are designed so that you can graduate her to faster flow nipples as she gets bigger.
__label__neg	Forget it
__label__pos	I love to see all the way he can come up to play with such a simple toy!
__label__neu	The first time I used the tub my baby kept slipping around in the tub.
__label__neg	I wonder if i could send it back
__label__neg	The only thing that kept it from being a 5-star for me was that you need a teeny screwdriver (eyeglass size, probably) to open the battery compartment.  
__label__neu	I would buy these bottles as a last resort if all others have failed to help your child's colic problem
__label__neu	I now realize I need to buy something else to use when travelling
__label__neu	But if your baby is really gasy and has colic, I recomend you the Dr brown bottles. 
__label__neg	 I also filed a complaint with the government consumer safety agency
__label__neg	 I ended up making my own sheets
__label__neg	My only complaint is that the color is not really a sage green--it's a bit lighter and brighter, like a pale grass green.
__label__neg	 He would rather sleep alone than sleep in this thing
__label__neu	(red when we ate pasta). 
__label__neg	It is cumbersome. 
__label__neg	 The brush literally came out of the handle
__label__pos	Also softer head and body than Sophie. 
__label__neg	 She likes to pick it up, shake it and then toss it on the floor
__label__neu	Had this product for a while and were very dissatisfied.
__label__pos	But even better is the new features it has a radio cell phone cupholder and traffic signal.
__label__neu	Wish we would have done a little more research before registering for this.
__label__pos	This one definitely keeps them tightly wrapped no matter what.
__label__neg	It literally could fit a 2 year old toddler. 
__label__pos	The color is beautiful and quality same as pricey strollers. 
__label__pos	"""I use this model for an art smock, but would absolutely bring it along for Christmas dinner or any other dress up occasion with a messy meal!"""
__label__neu	I'm definitely going back to my good old container,  I hope to find another use for this.
__label__neu	Last year when I was pregnant I asked other moms which cups and bottles to use.
__label__neu	Love it, but noisy...
__label__neg	The water stream coming from his mouth doesn't travel horizontally very much it makes it difficult to aim the stream of water away from my baby's eyes.
__label__pos	Awesome booster seat, easy to clean and stow. 
__label__neu	Sometimes we need to listen to our mom's and grandma's - they didnt have these and we turned out fine!
__label__neu	I bought this for my baby and thought it was awesome until she outgrew the sling which didn't take long at all. 
__label__neu	Do NOT buy these.
__label__neu	I had been using the Take and Toss ones in the sippy cups and saw these with the straws.
__label__neu	The rim of the Playtex liners is very thin and I had several leaks because the liner shifted as I squeezed the air from it.
__label__pos	It's a neat idea
__label__neu	In concept,  a frame/stroller like this is awesome,  but Graco needs to redesign this and make it better and sturdier.
__label__neg	"""You have to assemble the hanging moon & stars yourself which is a bit tedious."""
__label__neu	Highly disappointed in this diaper disposal system.
__label__pos	The music is enjoyable (not tinny sounding like other toys) and there are so many different sounds and sound bits that I can't keep track.
__label__neu	The handle does not twist the bag,  so it DOESN'T lock in the smell.
__label__neu	and more activites.
__label__neu	At a very young age, my son has exhibited the strong need to explore and see different things.
__label__neg	what they don't tell you is this
__label__neu	I've used it several times to take him for a walk, and I've also worn it when my husband and I have gone to an art fair.
__label__neg	Also if the baby spits up & you have to wash it, then it takes a long time to dry the foam insert.
__label__neu	I am so much trouble getting into a restful sleep position at 6 months...I loved the idea of this pillow & the good reviews.
__label__pos	Our son loves this bath tub!
__label__neg	I was originally happy with my diaper bag purchase until after she was two months old.
__label__neu	"""Are there nicer, sturdier products out there?"""
__label__neg	It pours!
__label__neu	Not worth the money or hassle!
__label__pos	Also, it is a lot bigger than most of the other pack n' plays and will come in really handy for holding toys when my son gets a little older.
__label__neg	 There's several brands out there
__label__pos	It does drip slightly when held upside down, but what sippy doesn't?
__label__pos	These are my favorite bottles for my little guy.  
__label__neu	There is a space of about 3mm at each side where the water just gushes out.
__label__pos	"""I'm sure this would have been an awesome nail filer if she was just an infant when her nails were still very soft and flexible."""
__label__pos	Definitely worth the money.
__label__pos	So pretty!  
__label__pos	"""So convenient, so versatile and so cheap compared to a full-size high chair!"""
__label__neu	Hmm. 
__label__neg	Not worth the money.
__label__pos	It fits a lot better around you than the Boppy.
__label__pos	Friend loved this item!
__label__pos	The cushioning on the kneeler is awesome and I also really like the elbow rest.The hanging organizer has two pockets which fit our daughters bathwash and bubble bath.
__label__neu	Also,  over time the gate tends to bend a little,  so you should use the little wrench-like tool to adjust it when necessary
__label__pos	I think that was a brilliant idea of Fisher Price to make the music and the mobile to stop after some time but keep the swing going for as long as you want.
__label__neu	As long as you find the right spot to place this monitor, it will work just fine, although it's not sensitive enough to detect breathing
__label__pos	We have had several diaper blow-outs and spit-ups on this, but the material washes up like a dream--does not shrink at all.  
__label__pos	This towel is adorable and seems to hold up well in the wash!
__label__neg	The legs are too short for our toilet, and our toilet is not one of those fancy extra high toilets.
__label__neg	 couldnt use it on a kitchen counter unless i wanted everything to get wet.doesnt open and close very easily -  i gave myself more than one bruise (due to pinched skin) when trying to open and close it. 
__label__neu	"""Because it clips you can move it around everywhere and I have used it on the car seat once or twice."""
__label__neg	 The milk seeps under the pump guard and it leaks out from the edges onto clothes. 
__label__neg	The Close and Secure Sleeper might be helpful when used in a crib and when travelling, but it has limited value in an adult bed, or at least it did for us
__label__neg	I bought this for my almost 2 year old after reading the rave reviews
__label__neu	He's now 29 months and he doesn't mess with the toilets.
__label__neu	Baby won't slip under the water because of the plastic mouldings, so you can have both hands free to wash and reach.
__label__pos	They are all helpful and can be used until your baby is a toddler.
__label__pos	He still has room to grow in this one!
__label__pos	We dno't know what we'd do without this!
__label__pos	 We've never had any problems with it breaking down
__label__neg	For a few more dollars, I would strongly recommend looking at Pottery Barn Kids' chamois pad covers
__label__neg	the construction is very poor and it not really worth the money,  but to late now for me
__label__pos	It worked out great.
__label__neg	With less than 1 year of use the cover has gotten several cracks along the tops of the sides. 
__label__pos	Now when we wrap him in it he actually smiles and falls asleep pretty quickly (we also use the motion of a bouncy seat or a hammock- sleep Amby bed to help transport him to dreamland).
__label__pos	"""a hassle!"""
__label__pos	I can't think of one thing I don't like about this toy!
__label__pos	I bought different kinds and only liked this ones they are sooo easy to instal and the tape is really hard although I did screw one side just in case.
__label__neg	"I bought this gate for the ""adjustable"" feature - I have baseboards throughout the house and needed a gate that could handle those."
__label__pos	It supports them all around from falling
__label__neg	If you are busying try the ExerSaucer (read my review).
__label__neg	One thing I don't like it my 3 year old's carseat doesn't have anywhere really to attach the strap but we make do.
__label__neg	Plus I used dish soap and let them dry out for a long time but one of the bib started to have black mold stains, and even cleaned that way they end up stinking after a day. 
__label__pos	Baby (4 months) is not gassy at all.
__label__pos	I felt that they looked better that two huge wet spots from leakage.
__label__neu	I ordered blue and in the picture it has a woven or printed dot pattern
__label__neg	My son outgrew it by the time he was 3 weeks old,  and he's average length.
__label__pos	Our other twin daughter has been using the 'rest assured' sleep positioner & I love it, so I just went out today & purchased a second one so they can both have a safe good nights sleep.
__label__neg	I spent SO much money on these bottles while I was pregnant,  because they were supposively the best bottles to use while breastfeeding
__label__pos	It gave him some extra cushion for comfort and protection while keeping him strapped snuggly into the cart
__label__pos	The back basket was SO easy to get to.  
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	"""I never had sheets fit so well and wash so well."""
__label__neg	Don't waste the money.
__label__neu	 I don't know what the problem is; perhaps the hole in the seat is simply too small
__label__neg	I would shop around for another one if you have wireless equipment in the house.
__label__pos	"""It is well made and colorful, and the different textures, sounds, colors, and movement really keep a baby entertained."""
__label__neu	We went looking for a stationary entertainer and knew we just had to get her this one.
__label__pos	However we still use the dishwasher which is fairly hot.
__label__neu	We bought one for our first child, and then another with our second. 
__label__pos	We loved this swing. 
__label__pos	"""So far I haven't had any problems with it."""
__label__pos	The sound worked great but I could never get a picture at all.  
__label__neg	 As she got a little taller, around 4 months, there wasn't room for the shower attachment AND her legs
__label__neg	I understand the reason for the baby recording button, however, I find it silly and annoying since I seem to hit it by accident.
__label__pos	"""no fuzzies that come off."""
__label__pos	For manual use I recommend the Avent Isis.
__label__neu	Browns
__label__neu	I will probably buy the Especially for Baby warmer,  which does not use a wall wart.
__label__neu	They are so thin they are see threw and not made well so they bend the mattress up.
__label__neg	"""Hope this helps and saves you money!"""
__label__neg	This was too big for my small baby even though it said it would fit.
__label__neg	First of all, the dispenser is useless.  
__label__neu	We have this same bath mat but in the elmo design.
__label__neu	Dr.
__label__neu	"""I'm rather surprised because her Leap Frog Learning Seat is one of her absolute favorite things."""
__label__neg	"""My little girl is 3 months and she is really curious and likes to face out but she can't because she's not tall enough."""
__label__pos	I LOVE this!!
__label__neu	This is a baby's toy for $20.  
__label__neg	 I don't know how any baby could fall asleep to this, mine never did
__label__neg	now,  i bought the Euro bath.
__label__neg	Yes,  it's better for glass bottles than the collapsible ones,  but it's NOT at all good for BORN FREE (or any other wide neck bottles) bottles because you can only fit them on every other upright (they're too wide to go right next to each other),  and there's no room for all of the other venting pieces that come with Born Free bottles
__label__neu	My second daughter only liked these, if it wasn't mommy (if ya know what I mean).
__label__neg	It was horrible.
__label__pos	She also enjoys chewing on the rings.  
__label__neg	It is almost impossible to hold the sprayer comfortably without blocking the water spray.  
__label__neu	I feel like I would have been better off with a regular trash can with a lid though
__label__neg	It wasn't until the next morning that I realized that it was the frog pod that fell off the wall (the sticky tape stopped working I guess
__label__neu	I put this item on our registry because I was looking forward to being able to carry around the top from room to room and to wheel it around when necessary.
__label__neu	My husband thinks that Sophie is too girly of a name for a boy toy so he insists that we call him Jerry.
__label__pos	My daughter no longer sleeps in a crib, but I keep this on a shelf in her room and she turns it on whenever she passes it. 
__label__neg	Minus side: the folding and locking mechanism is very stiff, and I was afraid I was breaking it at first when I was opening it up. 
__label__pos	My son did use it,  but I found several issues with using it
__label__neg	It is especially easy to do if the bottle is slightly squeezed to change the shape of the threaded lip.
__label__neg	"""And it left black looking fuzz all over my hands and clothes every time I touched it."""
__label__neg	 And the residual smell of past diapers is still in there, nothing makes it go away
__label__pos	It allows for a central place for bath toys,  and also allows for them to drain easily
__label__neu	Although I give it 2 stars cause I'm a rainforest fan
__label__neg	It honestly was more trouble than it was worth
__label__neu	 also, by the time your child can sit up in this might as well put them in the big tub..my daughter slipped and slid all over when we tried to sit her up.too short - by the time she was 4 months, she was too long for this tub and would kick the sides.i had regisered for the eurotub, but rec'd this. 
__label__neg	But it doesnt clip to ANYTHING. 
__label__neu	It warms the wipes nicely.
__label__pos	My son isn't old enough to appreciate it yet but I certainly do!
__label__pos	I really enjoy the fact that this swing is portable, very light, and most importantly...
__label__neu	The first time we bathed him without the tub he CRIED!  
__label__pos	 Fabric is easily washable
__label__neg	 Don't waste your money
__label__neu	I found that when I used the dishwasher bottles and nipples turned colors depending on the food that we ate that week. 
__label__neg	They take too long to thaw. 
__label__neg	Another problem is with washing it
__label__neg	"After reading the negative reviews of this mobile (and seeing its ""flimsiness"" for myself at a local Babis R Us store),  I went in search of other mobiles with a moon/stars motif."
__label__neg	 The bottles are by far not cheap and there shouldn't be so many issues
__label__pos	We went back to the store and bought the Ocean Wonders bouncer, which is cheaper and a much better product.
__label__pos	"""The bear works well, but I wish the sound would go for a longer period of time."""
__label__neu	"""The hospital bottle fed my son after taking him away from me because I had a c-section."""
__label__pos	 Good enough range
__label__pos	He received this for his 1st birthday and it was an instant hit.
__label__neg	Health risk
__label__neu	I keep reintroducing it to her after putting it up for a few weeks... never liked it.
__label__neu	Of course as soon as we opened the box the instructions clearly say DO NOT USE AT THE TOP OF STAIRS
__label__neu	I had bought this right before we moved 1/2 ways across the world.
__label__neu	TRY THIS ONE IF
__label__neu	Bought a hundred dollar pack and play and this was my ONLY option for a sheet
__label__neu	 just go to a brick and mortar store (like target) to purchase. 
__label__pos	She loves it and it's easy for her to manipulate
__label__neg	My whole bathroom smells like there is a skunk living in it.*UPDATE: My daughter slipped on this mat.
__label__pos	 We've never had any problems with it breaking down
__label__pos	We are going to buy the sea turtle one for our baby on the way.
__label__neg	 These suck
__label__pos	Before i had this pillow i was having restless nights with little or no sleep at all due to suddenly having to accustom myself to sleeping on the sides.Once i received this pillow,not one sleepless night.This pillow is a boon for every pregnant lady.
__label__neg	There is no way one person can work this
__label__pos	This bag makes sure you pack just the ESSENTIALS!  
__label__pos	It holds lots of diapers and I do not have to spend money on refill bags.
__label__pos	The neck loop is fastened by D-rings, allowing you to adjust it easily with just one hand.
__label__pos	For us this has been a very worthwhile item. 
__label__pos	We ended up with a $5 buck toy net that sticks to the wall perfectly!
__label__pos	good
__label__neu	A word about leaks.  
__label__neu	I prefer to do it the old fashioned way...boil a pot of water & dunk everything in.
__label__neu	We bought this right after we began putting my daughter to bed in her crib.  
__label__neg	She's now 4.5 mos and I'm throwing it away b/c she is practically flipping out of it.
__label__pos	This is an absolutely wonderful product.
__label__neg	Every time you have to buy refills it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.
__label__neg	i thought this would be a great product for him but he never really took to it
__label__neg	Good luck.
__label__neg	(this was one of many problems) I was horrified
__label__neg	I'd be worried about putting a baby on top of it, it feels ready to fall apart at any minute.  
__label__pos	The bottles don't leak at all and they don't cause gas.
__label__neg	This is probably the worst product I have ever bought
__label__pos	It is holding up so far in the wash, so the quality seems good.
__label__neu	Because of where you'd have the cup positioned on your child's head, this means the water goes in their ears, down both sides of their face and even some into the eyes.
__label__pos	More interesting to baby than you'd think...
__label__neu	i didnt find that the bottle itself leaked but the milk came out too fast and caused my baby to choke and spit up all over.
__label__neu	I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWER ABOUT THIS BEING SAFER THAN A SNOWSUIT BECAUSE U CAN ADJUST THE CARSEAT STRAPS RIGHT TO YOUR BABY WITH NO LOOSE STRAPS LIKE THERE WOULD BE WITH A JACKET OR SNOWSUIT
__label__neg	It has just become more annoying than useful.
__label__pos	We haven't had any problems.
__label__neg	This was one baby gift I wish we would've returned before using - a recieving blanket works much better. 
__label__neg	"""Plus it is kind of fun flipping the top to get the diaper in."""
__label__pos	They keep things (such as a bra) from rubbing against very very sore nipples.
__label__pos	The drop- in bags are disposable but very very durable I give them a good washing and reuse them!
__label__neg	 Now they've shrunk so small I can't even use them as cleaning rags. 
__label__pos	and the design is perfect. 
__label__neg	These bags leave a lot to be desired
__label__pos	"""that simple."""
__label__neg	Can really only fit about 2 diapers wipes and powder.
__label__neg	"He cried and hung on the side the whole time until I ""freed"" him."
__label__pos	Wish we had found this months ago!
__label__neu	Initially I would have recommended this warmer but now I say DONT BUY IT!
__label__pos	This and the ultimate wipes warmer where two of the things that I purchased right away because I had read all of the reviews and everyone said they were 'lifesavers'. 
__label__neu	Our daughter seemed to be carried with her head by my ear when I tried it as a front pack.
__label__pos	very comfortable and stay put pretty well.
__label__pos	This is my second child, but they're 8 years apart- I wish they had this 8 years ago! 
__label__pos	Easy to clean, and easy to hold.
__label__neg	 Do not waste your money
__label__pos	"""It's also a lot nicer looking after it's been used a while because the black rubber on the top wears so nicely."""
__label__neg	If you cant make it water resistant put a Velcro strap on it
__label__neg	 I only use their bottles and pacifiers and have been a happy customer in the past
__label__neg	 She is only 26 inches in length
__label__neu	The only part me and my son liked was he liked to pull the container out by himself and empty it thats why i gave it the 2 stars i did. 
__label__pos	This is great to have!
__label__pos	"""I'm glad I got this pillow."""
__label__pos	On the up side, it is light.
__label__neu	At first I couldn't understand why he had blood on his toes but then we noticed blood lines on the white netting
__label__neg	One of our spigots has a diverter and when I tried this cover, the water sprays weakly from all sides of the mouth instead of flowing nicely towards the front
__label__pos	They are very soft and seems to last very nicely.
__label__neu	I bought these after my Avent bottles started to leak. 
__label__neu	A great price and you will be the envy of all
__label__pos	A LIFE SAVER!!
__label__pos	It is a huge improvement over the very basic one I had with son 7 years ago (his was basically the same thing but no toys at all on top) and he loved it even then lol.
__label__neu	"""We placed it inside our co-sleeper, initially, and later took it with us when visiting Grandma."""
__label__pos	The champ is great because you don't have to waste anymore money buying expensive refills like the diaper genie.
__label__neu	I'm an organization freak,  so naturally I tried this out for bath toys to be able to drip dry
__label__neg	we buy a lot of stuff on amazon, and frankly I am really disappointed with the quality of this unit
__label__neu	"""The hospital used those Similac ready made formula that comes in their own bottle."""
__label__pos	"""Its the same big hit the second time around!"""
__label__pos	It was great!
__label__pos	Its motions are completely irresistible to even the grumpiest sleep-avoider.
__label__pos	"""It keeps the rest of my son's crib sheets dry, so easy to take off and clean."""
__label__neg	I didn't like these for a few reasons. 
__label__pos	I know, the price seems high, but this is one luxury that is truly a necessity.
__label__neu	00
__label__pos	Pros:They ARE really soft!!They are a sustainable material. 
__label__neu	But we solved our problem by taking the nipple off of the Gerber bottle and use it on the VentAire bottle
__label__neg	But I think I would have rather spent a little extra to get something a little better.
__label__neu	We used both, containers and jars and therefore had to have two different stands.
__label__neg	However it DOES NOT keep out the smell of dirty diapers.  
__label__neu	Kind of a nice feature when you're running around the house and you don't have time to put it down
__label__pos	I Love this monitor.
__label__neu	i suppose this seat is better than layering tons of toilet paper on a toilet bowl
__label__neg	 I generally use them every night in the dishwasher, but I'll be throwing them out soon. 
__label__neu	I am starting to notice an oder escape from the diaper pail but it's nothing that I cannot handle.
__label__neg	It holds very little food and it's hard to scoop up food
__label__pos	It is not as cute but it is much more practical.
__label__neu	You couldn't tell if the baby was banging on her crib bars or if someone was moving heavy machinery about in her bedroom.
__label__neg	He moves around too much and they fall off
__label__neg	We had to constantly try to keep up with which nipples were the good ones and which ones didn't work.
__label__pos	when being held in position (by me) the water flowed nicely off it to give a good waterfall to shower off my toddlers soapy head
__label__neu	 So I threw it out and bought the larger flip n' sip cups, which are made of safe polypropylene plastic
__label__neg	he still had the same problem
__label__neu	"""Found this at a local store for half the price after buying online."""
__label__pos	She likes to look at the moving birds and leaves at the top.
__label__neu	P. S> You have to adjust the straps as your baby grows then nothing will press against her diaper area or anywhere else.
__label__neg	I had to squeeze with the motor at the HIGHEST setting to get just a little. 
__label__neu	 Look at it
__label__neu	... what can I say... Online, these baskets looked adorable and the review was a good one.
__label__neu	It's pretty big as far as picnic blankets go and if they were to offer a blanket a few sizes larger, I would buy it in a heartbeat.  
__label__pos	I threw this out and bought the safety 1st odorless diaper pail which I find contains the odor much better
__label__neg	We tried all different places in our house to plug it in and it didn't get any better
__label__neu	I wish they were a little thicker but they do the job.
__label__pos	Would have been better off getting small shelves to fit more baby food in the cabinet.
__label__neu	You have a very abundant milk supply- You only plan to pump one or twice a month- You wouldn't mind giving your baby formula if you had to be away from her for an extended periodINVEST THE MONEY IN A HIGHER-END MODEL IF
__label__pos	We received this one for our baby shower along with a Fischer Price mat, and our son LOVES the Baby Einstein mat and shows little interest in the other one.
__label__pos	Works great
__label__neu	 However, the instructions insist on sterilizing the pump after each use
__label__neu	It's a much better investment
__label__neg	Too thin
__label__neg	 They don't stand up on their own so you have to set them in a cup when they have milk in them
__label__neg	go with aquaphor baby wash
__label__neg	I do not recommend this product based on my personal experience
__label__neu	You do get used to the amount of pressure required to push down a diaper and as new parents,  we've learned how to roll up the diaper into a tiny,  compact package
__label__pos	He took this one over all the other pricy ones.
__label__neu	SO we were taking a very long,  very boring car trip and I thought that having a mirror with lights and sounds would work wonders for our 4 month old
__label__neg	And of course it won't fit on our Graco stroller.
__label__pos	It really is not as obnoxious as it seems.
__label__neu	A relative purchased the Baby Einstein Play Gym for my daughter when she was one month old.
__label__neg	Leaks?
__label__neg	This product is completely unusable without a finish on it
__label__pos	I nursed my twins for about 4 1/2 months, so I thought the Avent would be the best.
__label__neg	 We ended up paying a cheaper price as well
__label__neu	The cup comes with three adapters- one for a straw for older kids one for a regular valve for younger kids (leaks a bit but just what is left in the straw portion of the mouthpiece- not a continuous stream of fluid) and a stopper for travel.
__label__pos	I'd really recommend them for that.
__label__neg	Both my hands were tied up when pumping both sides. 
__label__neg	 And seventeen of these wouldn't even fit in my washer every day
__label__neu	We started to use it since when she was 5 days old. 
__label__neu	I've tried everything. 
__label__neu	If it's winter and you want this wipe then go right ahead BUT be sure to have the wipes VERY CLOSE to the baby
__label__neg	"""And that could be a lot when you need to run and get things done."""
__label__pos	Makes sheet changing so easy!
__label__neg	"""I bought this mat for my infant son's playroom, it comes apart easily and the pieces don't fit tightly."""
__label__pos	The safer bather is the BEST baby bath aid out there!
__label__pos	I just got this today and I love it so far.
__label__neg	I had to return the bundle me because it doesn't fit our Peg Perego Primo Viaggio SIP 30/30 car seat
__label__neu	You must jiggle it to make it work- Static/noise appearing in the signal when nothing else has changed (e.g.
__label__neu	I tried three different methods/positions of installing it and it had shifted each time I got in the car.
__label__neu	If you can get another model that swings both ways, do that
__label__neu	I tried again thinking she'll realize what she did,  which she did,  but now she just pushes the top in until everything falls out
__label__neg	I breastfeed him also and trust me
__label__pos	The only pacifier she would take.
__label__pos	 The only reason I get ANY sleep at night is due to this swing
__label__neg	The odor was still present while using it and when I would open it to put a diaper in it the horrible stench would become even worse and would linger for hours
__label__pos	The gate provides good protection
__label__neu	Colors are way to dull.
__label__neu	The Diaper Genie II and it's brother the Diaper Genie II Elite are barely related
__label__neu	I am travelling alone with my son
__label__neu	Still waiting for baby to come...
__label__neu	Now my son is 5 months and in his playpen he tries to reach his train.
__label__neg	 He said that these things come in and out of style and for some reason have come back in fashion again, but can be a big risk for SIDS- scary!! 
__label__neg	I don't know if I like these or not
__label__pos	The classic organic toy crinkle bear is beginning to become a hit in my house.
__label__neu	They want to run and carry-on until they get so tired that they NEED to sit. 
__label__neu	"""We have hard water and the bottle water keeps the hard water residue down."""
__label__neu	It is an eye sore in the living room.
__label__neu	I took it back and got another brand.
__label__neg	Just check the strength,  please?
__label__neg	We didn't like hearing the constant white noise it makes when on
__label__neu	I used it a few times when I had to push my mom in the wheelchair and carry my baby at the same time because I had no other alternative to carry my baby.
__label__neg	This Taggies toy is not much fun for baby at all!
__label__neg	This sling is okay,  but i really didn't use it much because it hurt my back
__label__neu	No matter what is in there I don't want my son drinking it
__label__neu	I agree with many of the other reviews .
__label__pos	Best Swing Available
__label__neu	There is so much for my little one to do.
__label__neg	I use them for one thing and that is decoration of my son's spoon cup.
__label__neu	However it was much easier to control and felt safer with him being secure in the tub seat....
__label__pos	Overall it's a great product to have and well worth the money.
__label__pos	This monitor is FANTASTIC!  
__label__neg	 Also, cleaning down into the bend of this pump thoroughly is practically impossible.
__label__pos	I am very pleased with it.
__label__neg	 I really liked the features, but didn't like it once i put my son in it. 
__label__neu	"""She only poops once a day or so-I just put it in a plastic bag and straight into the outside can."""
__label__pos	This is great for me because it is less clean up!Would highly recommend!
__label__neg	The hand held unit did not work. 
__label__pos	it also has small compartments for credit cards / pens.  
__label__pos	"""It has come in handy several times when she has had accidents and we need somewhere to put wet clothes."""
__label__neu	When I pump one breast at a time I put the shell to the breast that is not being pumped.
__label__pos	"""But for the new baby stage I prefer the sleepy wrap and my son likes it too, he will sleep in it for a long time."""
__label__neu	My little girls is old enough now she notices the little pea pod on the front.  
__label__pos	In the meantime,  it has everything I am looking for
__label__neg	 My daughter seemed uncomfortable in this car seat from day one
__label__neu	I'm on Amazon now looking for a replacement
__label__pos	Great fun for baby!
__label__neu	"""My baby was born is September 2003, and we just started using the Bundle Me."""
__label__pos	We have such a hard time getting her to sleep in her crib, but she loves this chair.
__label__pos	They will thank you.
__label__neu	 It was given to me as a gift, a lot of people said great things about it and I registered for it before my baby was due. 
__label__neu	I was kind of disappointed to find that out, but we love it.
__label__neg	Do not waste your money unless you like to be disappointed or if you like to return products to the stores
__label__pos	"""The reason i love this is that we have white noise makers in my sons room and the monitor obviously picks it up, but because it is a constant sound it doesn't stay on when on the sound activated setting."""
__label__pos	They can be easily tossed into the washing machine, which is a must for any toy used by a teething baby.He also digs the crate they came in.
__label__neg	 I had high hopes for this but just not long enough
__label__pos	I think these baskets are great.  
__label__neu	I would be giving it 5 stars if I had this gate longer,  but couldnt wait to post the great review after purchasing it and seeing how great my dogs are adapting to it.
__label__pos	"""She is just so enticed by winnie the pooh and all the characters."""
__label__neg	I can change a poopie diaper like a pro but everytime I empty out the
__label__pos	When I got home I found laying her in it was perfect, kept her upright so I didn't have to worry about her choking on her milk after feeding, since she has acid reflux the doctor suggested keeping her upright for at least 5 minutes after feedings.
__label__neg	 I instead purchased the Prince Lionheart undermat that has the same sort of soft tacky feel as the recommened shelf liner
__label__neu	 Honestly, you would be better served to purchase a bolster pillow for between your knees and a heatable (chamomile or lavender) beanbag pillow. 
__label__neu	the zipper is a little tough so I don't use it,  but you just flop this thing in that cart,  insert baby,  do a few snaps with the straps and you are OFF
__label__pos	Well, all I can say is that I am truely pleased with this warmer. 
__label__neu	i use them for my daughter as well as my son. 
__label__neg	This was just too much trouble for me
__label__neg	I found that in order to keep the wipes warm you had to severly saturate the sponge on the bottom
__label__pos	Seems it has more features than the peacock.
__label__pos	I have used this several times to go to the doctors and grocery store and would recommend it to any twin parent.
__label__neu	These are fine if you clean one bottle a day.
__label__neg	The first two differences are quite cosmetic: the genie is a few inches shorter and it does not have a foot pedal
__label__neu	We used this once
__label__pos	 You can get almost just as many uses from a pack of 75 13gal trash bags and they are so much cheaper (about $2)
__label__pos	I recommend this product highly!
__label__neu	I already bought a 2nd one for us and one for a friend and I will get one for my sister-in-law when my niece is a little older.  
__label__neu	"""I tried to use both preemie and newborn sized disposable for the short term and for visits and they both leaked so badly that I had to change his clothes almost every time!"""
__label__neu	She was less than 4 months old when I put her in ExerSaucer (a bit too early) so I had to put blanket around her body to keep her body straight but she was doing okay in there.
__label__neu	I was sick of boiling water or waiting for a full load to run the dishwasher. 
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	Surprisingly large amount of storage. 
__label__neg	Sadly, when I tried to fit it back onto the frame it had shrunk considerably.
__label__neu	You can see everything that your child is doing.
__label__neg	 I drive an SUV and I found a bigger mirror instead
__label__neg	" Take note, it says ""The machine has no traceable amounts of BPA"
__label__neg	The only thing I would change is the cover.
__label__pos	My 2 month old daughter LOVES Jacques.
__label__neu	The temperature gauge has to get pretty darn hot to start changing color, so I don't use it.  
__label__neu	I find that I have no problem with the unit lasting through night (10-12 hours),  but that I do need to recharge it during the day
__label__pos	This chair made my life easier!
__label__pos	"""2. the music is much more entertainig and not annoying."""
__label__neg	 Our second refused to sleep in it period (even padding it with a small quilt). 
__label__neu	I used a toothpick and pin-pricked the year at the bottom.
__label__pos	 The small one has the same rod but for whatever reason, it is doing fine. 
__label__neu	I registered and received this gift for my baby shower. 
__label__neg	I bought this pump and right away I had problems when I would be pumping it would fall apart. 
__label__neg	The only negative comment I have on this is that it does tend to make me a little warm while sleeping but I think anything would.
__label__neg	The bags are small.
__label__pos	It worked well and we got good use out of it.
__label__pos	"""I could tell using Dr. Brown's that my son wasn't taking in as much air as he was with the Avent bottles we had been using."""
__label__neu	My daughter is 3 and she likes to walk when we are out, but there are times when she wants to sit or when it just isnt safe for her to do it. 
__label__neu	Pricey.
__label__neg	 I am a big fan of Graco products, but not these
__label__neg	Within 3 weeks, the ink on the bottles came off of them
__label__pos	"""This solved all my problems."""
__label__neg	There are these 3 indents on the silicon part that should align with the three indents on the plastic cover, but for whatever reason, when I screw the top shut the alignment is always off. 
__label__pos	We also use them to teach him about colors (can you bring mommy the green cup? etc about big and little etc
__label__neg	I was also given a couple of other velcro type swaddles,  none of them worked
__label__neg	 Either we have the worlds worst luck with minotors or saftey first's quality is going down hill
__label__neg	I know when it comes to certain plastic products, they have this certain chemical smell that goes away shortly after you remove it from the packaging.
__label__neu	What's wrong with just shaking the formula in the bottle?
__label__pos	Beautiful Pack N Play, lots of features
__label__pos	"""Love this sterilizer."""
__label__pos	It's soft, easy and quick to use, and our son doesn't squirm out of it. 
__label__neu	don't really have a problem with smell control with either of these,  but our 6mo old is exclusively breastfed and of course,  smells like roses
__label__pos	I have had this from the day my daughter came home from the hospital and it has held up in the wash. No major accidents on it but the few there were are due to my not folding up the stinky diapers all the way or her spitting up.
__label__neu	I buy a box of bags at Target that I use for the kitchen and the Diaper Champ and they cost less than ten dollars for over 100 bags.
__label__pos	"""which is a nice pad along with our changing pad (which we whip clean before use  and after use.."""
__label__pos	Now I understand why these are so popular!
__label__neu	(For whatever reason current dislikes include carrots - who'd have guessed?)The mesh feeder is more hit- or- miss; the baby will mouth the food end a bit and then settle into chewing the plastic ring end.
__label__neg	 He would arch his back and slip forward into the bath ring, thus painfully squishing his private parts. 
__label__pos	The idea behind these bags is great - you can pump straight into the bag and store them
__label__pos	"""Now, at 3.5 months, he loves hitting and grabbing the hanging toys."""
__label__neg	Talk about making your job harder than it already is! 
__label__neu	I had NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO idea
__label__neu	I can't imagine how much of a pain it would be to have to lift the crib mattress up to change sheets
__label__neu	"So I went out and bought the Especially For Baby manicure set (with a much better clipper,  plus scissors and emery boards) and had great success,  so I thought I'd give this clipper a try again now that I'm ""better"" at cutting baby's nails."
__label__pos	"""This is a good product."""
__label__neg	when baby may be wearing a snowsuit one day and a sweatshirt the next
__label__pos	They are super absorbent, very easy to clean and a perfect size for many different things.
__label__pos	I love the 5 height adjustments the washable pad and removable front toys.
__label__neg	 Her head was right in front of my chin too
__label__pos	You don't even need a hat-there is a detachable hood. 
__label__neu	The design idea was good but it just isn't practical for a baby tub that will need to be used regularly. 
__label__neg	"""We are much happier with the diaper champ."""
__label__neg	Also, the wide bottles don't fit very well in the bottle compartment of my diaper bag, and my daughter is not use to the wide nipples.
__label__neu	1) It only covers a small area (even on a 12 month old).
__label__neu	Our baby was almost exclusively breast fed from the start
__label__neg	 I had bought this to make our daily walk to the mailboxes easy
__label__pos	It took up a lot of room in our bed but my husband dog myself and pillow were all still able to sleep in our queen size bed with little complaining from my husband.
__label__neg	I can't speak for anyone else but personally the idea of having to constantly buy expensive refills for my diaper pail when we already have trash bags in the house is nuts.
__label__pos	I would recommend all dads (and moms) to consider getting their Baby Bjorn. 
__label__neg	I do NOT recommend
__label__neu	I ended up returning this mirror though for a few reasons.
__label__neu	I tried it on once.
__label__neu	"However,  I recently found out that this teether ball is made from PVC,  which is in my opinion a ""poison"" plastic."
__label__pos	I have used this pump for 5 months and been very happy with it.
__label__pos	It doesn't attach to anything but it's definitely the best!
__label__neg	However, it only entertained him for a couple of months because they get over the need to jump.
__label__pos	def worth the money
__label__neg	 I try to sleep with this on my night stand but can't because of the static
__label__neg	Baby will grow up eventually so the locks are not needed.
__label__pos	"""You can easily open the zippers on both sides to control the temperature, and even take the cover off, leaving only the back part on the car seat."""
__label__pos	"""The fleece (polyester) that lines the inside comes off so easily."""
__label__neg	These were my second attempt to find a good sippy cup with a straw and I'm disappointed yet again
__label__neu	The hook-n-loop on the strap to connect to stroller/high chair/etc
__label__pos	"""It can be simply used by itself by just fastening the straps to the sides of the crib or can be used with a more decorative sheet simply placed snugly in place over it."""
__label__neu	She even falls asleep in it sometimes.
__label__neg	I got this hamper as a gift
__label__pos	"""It is easy to hold for baby, it is easy to reach any area of baby's gums (by teething on a leg for the back of the gums, an ear for the front of the gums, etc) and the material is on the softer side-unlike most teethers which seem to be too tough...."""
__label__pos	She seemed so much more comfortable than in the hard plastic bathtub, and much more stable as well.
__label__pos	"""She really enjoys herself!"""
__label__neu	It is large enough to hold all of my son's various bath toys and foam letters.  
__label__pos	it took me about three nights to find my favorite position with the pillow, but now i use it every night.
__label__pos	The service by target is very good.
__label__neu	"""I have had it for one day, and have installed it in my Prius."""
__label__pos	She loves the toys that come standard and can't be removed, but she also likes the ones that can be changed.
__label__neg	 I can't imagine how they passed any kind of testing when they were being made
__label__pos	It is a perfect receiving/swaddling blanket.  
__label__pos	"""Excellent product."""
__label__pos	We have no problem seeing the amber color on his ceiling.
__label__neu	It's way too short!
__label__neu	The BIGGEST drawback is that they are a real *pain* to clean.
__label__neu	If not we will be returning it which is really a shame because it's really cute and a big space saver for our small bathroom.  
__label__pos	All my joints were loosened up and my hip and shoulder pain is gone!
__label__neu	I searched for weeks for a decent bedding set for my 2.5 year old.
__label__neg	It's not her cheeks that need soothing!
__label__neg	 My daughter was excited about the print on the seat, but as soon as we used it out in a public bathroom, she wasn't very happy
__label__pos	"""We also have the Evenflo Exersaucer, and she didn't care as much for that one."""
__label__neu	Next time around, I will fork out the money for the electric medelas. 
__label__pos	I bought this for my ten month old and she likes the music but she is just too old for it.
__label__neg	I agree with other reveiwers, the slow flow nipples that come with the bottle are worthless.
__label__neu	Our pediatrician said it was okay to swaddle up to 4 months.
__label__neu	Not very convenient for long or short road trips.
__label__neu	That was strike two!
__label__pos	The valance is big enough to fit even large windows.
__label__neu	It is very poor quality and I would never buy something from The First Years again.
__label__pos	The clippers are my favorite since they are very easy to handle.
__label__pos	I bought this tub before my son was born,  thinking it looked great and I could use it in the kitchen sink
__label__neg	So,  if you have a foam mattress in a corner of the room,  I'd suggest just getting normal sheets and some of those stay-dry liners
__label__neg	It just made noise.
__label__pos	"""It's great 'cause we don't have to struggle with blankets anymore, and don't have to dress our baby in snowsuits either!"""
__label__pos	It suspends him and lets soapy water pass through as i rinse him off making for a safer, faster, cleaner rinse.
__label__neu	I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWS THAT THE LID POPS MUCH TOO EASILY.
__label__neu	I was quite surprised that it was rated so safe considering the fact that it really is a bare bones car seat.  
__label__neg	It's just AWFUL
__label__pos	"""They fit snug, so you have to use some force to pull them out."""
__label__neg	Very unimpressed and returned it.
__label__neu	"""UPDATE:Now that my baby is a little bigger (around 9.5 pounds, 23 inches), I am still using the newborn size with a folded liner in front."""
__label__neu	got another brand
__label__pos	"""I got it for my 1st child when she was 6 months old and she loved it immediately."""
__label__neg	Even if it did fit I still would have had to return it since she knew how to open it.
__label__neu	Do not waste your money on the diaper genie.
__label__neu	Before I became a mom, I thought I needed a huge bag but it turns out, I don't (not sure why).
__label__pos	This does run on big batteries, not included.
__label__pos	My baby has loved this since she was about six months old.
__label__pos	Unlike all the others, it zippers up simply for storage and comes with its own straps so you don't have to put those yucky store ones on your baby.
__label__pos	This was a great diaper bag
__label__pos	I also love that it comes with two receivers.  
__label__neg	Like most everyone else who owns the UPPAbaby Vista, I HATE the cupholder. 
__label__neg	 So, I didn't realise they weren't quite the same thing
__label__neu	However you don't save any money because all the parts cost more than most sippy cups.
__label__neu	Then,  my milk supply started to diminish,  due to the pumps inability to stimulate my breasts to keep producing,  but I guess this feature would be good if you wanted to stop breastfeeding and ease the engorgement
__label__pos	It is a great monitor!
__label__neu	We even take it with us to restaurants so she can chew on pieces of fruit.
__label__pos	My advice is to buy a very simple tub such as Safety 1st, it's enough and frankly babies like them best 
__label__neu	It also has most of the same great features.My only dilemma is we ordered the leg extension set because we have a pillowtop mattress, making our bed rather high.
__label__neg	I still have to say I don't trust it and I am supervising very closely when he is in it.
__label__neu	"""Washed them many times."""
__label__neg	 My daughter is not yet sitting up on her own and yet she is too long to be reclined comfortably in this tub
__label__neg	 I am although stuck with eight of the smaller ones
__label__pos	Our daughter loved being placed on it when the warm water would press thru with her weight on the cushion. 
__label__neu	Got this as a gift at my baby shower
__label__neg	I called Medela and asked how I could get tubing made by them for the first generation Pump in Style
__label__pos	Instead of bending over, trying to hold them with the crook of your arm, plop them in the hammock and they get to relax and enjoy the warm water.
__label__neg	As the other reviewer mentioned the straw separated for cleaning which is great but also very easy to lose in the dishwasher.
__label__neu	I have pumped everday since the day she was born btwn 5 and 8 times a day
__label__neg	 He is now afraid of it
__label__neg	 when i switched bottles the gas stopped
__label__pos	We save $$ on those expensive diaper genie refills AND it works great.
__label__neu	She hates being put down but doesn't mind the swing as much.
__label__pos	Even now, when my 2-year old son sees it sitting in the nursery, he has to sit down and PLAY with it!This is a great, quality product at a great price- WORTH EVERY PENNY!
__label__pos	I wish i had this diaper back pack to start with.
__label__pos	The Babyhawk and the Ergo are by far my favorites.  
__label__neg	The tray does not come off easliy and my daughterr never enjoyed this lovely swing.
__label__neg	It collapses on everything, it falls on her. 
__label__pos	He hit his head on a console table that was behind him,  which was actually probably a good thing because it helped slow the momentum,  but then he did hit the floor.
__label__neg	 But the legs can choke, which is why we've replaced it with a friendly velvet rocketship
__label__neu	When I pulled myself down a little bit to avoid this,  the pillow became useless for two reasons.
__label__neu	The original manufacturer also has a website and there is a video of how to use this swaddle on there
__label__pos	he doesn't slip and is comfortable lying on this.
__label__pos	It rocks him to sleep and he'll stay comfortably asleep in it for most of the night.
__label__neg	 I just started using the mircrowave and it seem to heat faster this way
__label__neu	It may just be how my breasts are shaped though.  
__label__neu	I can see that it would be comfortable but it was easier to bathe without this bulky item.... 
__label__pos	Buy a Boppy - you'll be glad you did!
__label__pos	"""She fits great in the contoured area and the water level is sufficient to keep her warm and happy during bathtime."""
__label__neg	 The other problem I've had is washing. 
__label__pos	She's just that good for little mouths.  
__label__neu	Be aware.
__label__pos	"""About a week ago we actually started trying to potty train and these come in really handy."""
__label__pos	And I highly recommend it.
__label__pos	It is very light weight and easy to open and close and would fit easily in any trunk and should still leave room.The baby bargian book that I used when creating my registry and making initial baby purchases recommended that expectant parents purchase an infant seat and and infant seat frame and wait to buy a stroller until baby is older.
__label__pos	It is super convenient and easy to clean....think machine wash :-).
__label__pos	"""He really likes the soft spout."""
__label__pos	Every once in a while we'll get a tad bit of static, but the house is pretty big, so it's expected. 
__label__neu	I love my Britax stroller but was lost without a drink/ wallet holder on top.
__label__pos	It saves your last reading so you dont have to try and remember what it was last time to know if your baby's temp is better or worse.
__label__neg	Valves are super tough to remove for cleaning,   and they always are being cleaned.
__label__pos	It does warm the bottle to the perfect temperature.
__label__pos	"""My 6 month old's favorite toy by far."""
__label__pos	Now that I've been using it I LOVE the fact that it can attach to a stroller or shopping cart with ease
__label__neu	one ventilated (with holes) and one without holes.
__label__neg	That is TOO expensive.
__label__pos	This is a great sterilizer and is so easy to use.
__label__pos	Still - this item was very handy.
__label__pos	Love this carrier.
__label__neg	I was disappointed with the quality.
__label__pos	The flight attendants were happy to carry the car seat to an airplane seat, and I put my son into a regular seat (strapped with a SEAT BELT) while I installed the car seat on the plane.Sure it seems expensive for something so small, but it works!
__label__neu	I got hardly any juice and the feel of the mesh in my mouth was gross.
__label__pos	Ask any lactation consultant and they will tell you that Medela is the best commercial grade pump you can get.
__label__pos	"""It secures well to the headrest, but I like that there are multiple ways to secure the mirror."""
__label__neg	I was unable to use the newborn size Swaddler right away because she was too small.  
__label__neu	Have never lost any of those pieces and replacements are inexpensive.
__label__neu	 Hummmm
__label__neg	The only downfall to these bottles is they are a little more labor intensive to wash and put together.
__label__neu	[...]  
__label__neu	It is a terrible product.
__label__neu	It took too long to wrap it around the body and get it on just right.
__label__neu	This item is absolutely terrible.
__label__neg	sippy cups.
__label__neu	It says that if your dvd player is too short to use the longer side,  reverse it and use the longer side of the guard on the player and the shorter side to cover the buttons.
__label__pos	My son is almost two years old and loves this turtle.
__label__neu	And the wheels seem to only want to go forward and backward,  so when I would move it around the room (which I had to do every day) I had to shove it with all of my might to turn it.
__label__pos	If you have to pump a lot, and can afford it, a double pump is the way to go though.
__label__neu	We got these becasue our new house has a brick fireplace with an elevated ledge
__label__pos	With just a simple adustment to the strap I can change it to wrap her around me.
__label__neg	As for the noise, it does make a slight sound, but not as loud as the previous reviews made it out to be.
__label__pos	These work well enough as sippy cups and it is nice that the parts are interchangeable from bottle to sippy.
__label__pos	"""At 3 months old his coordination is really starting to develop and it is easy for him to get and keep a hold of the rings."""
__label__neu	 - it only turns on when the baby cries or your spouse talks, etc
__label__neg	2) It is really loud when you close the lid
__label__neu	"""After about two weeks of pretty much leaving it alone, she decided she wanted to come into the kitchen, and she wanted to do it NOW."""
__label__pos	The kaboost did the job.
__label__neu	We can't see any real need for the longer mode since the quick mode keeps the bottles sterile for 6 hrs.
__label__neg	But this is *NOT* designed and should never be used to guard the top of a stairway
__label__neg	This tub is more trouble than it's worth
__label__neu	She had a Graco car seat that was one year old, plus I have used other infant car seats for my two older children, a Graco and an Evenflo.  
__label__pos	I recommend it.
__label__neu	The ones on that toy are really neat.
__label__neu	I bought the  Busy Zoo at Target and my then twelve-month old twins liked it very much,  although it did not take my son long to learn to tip it over and reach inside the hollow underside.
__label__pos	"""He enjoyed the sights and sounds for 20 minutes!"""
__label__neu	Then I bought some Dr
__label__neg	It is annoying to have to switch bottles several times while pumping.
__label__pos	The backpack is cleverly designed to fit the motor and the collection kit in a compact manner.
__label__neu	Finally!
__label__pos	Otherwise, product is great.
__label__neg	Then it started making slurping noises and the rings for suction started to not go on properly (I have never sterilized any parts in a sterilizer or anything else or placed any of the parts in a dishwasher,  so the reason for the parts not fitting right can't be because of them being warped or damaged in someway by me
__label__neu	If we used a diaper bag that we had to carry on our shoulder, our shoulders would have been sore.
__label__neu	You can get them at any Babies R Us or Toys R Us.
__label__pos	I love this co-sleeper because I have a one-bedroom apartment and I prefer bedsharing to a crib.
__label__pos	Anyway, spend the extra dollars and get one!!!
__label__neu	I really prefer Bumpkin.
__label__neg	And if you have an elongated bowl the seat actually ends up sitting towards the back making it a little hard for the kid to climb on to.  
__label__neu	I'd get the superyard XT instead.
__label__neg	"""basically a stationary seat with some very soft cushions and a little vibration and music."""
__label__neu	if you get a big blow out diaper like babies are known to do,  and you get poop on the pail,  it does need to be wiped off
__label__neu	You are NOT to leave a child unattended in this chair,  however,  I immediately returned this to the store,  in lieu of its rewards,  when I observed how my baby would arch her back and lift out of the chair.
__label__neg	Our 2 1/2 month old son likes to sit in this seat and stare at the toys, but he doesn't care for the vibration like he does in his other bouncer.
__label__pos	"""The crinkly wings make great noise and the colors are very vibrant."""
__label__neg	It jams all the time, which requires two hands (a safety hazard while changing a baby). 
__label__pos	I actually tried many bottles before I splurged and bought these.I spent alot of money on the Avent bottles because they were supposed to be the closest to the breast.
__label__neu	I work from home on the computer and I needed both hands to work,  so i thought this would help
__label__pos	"""That was not very good to use because you have to climb in and out of the gate."""
__label__pos	"""The voice activated feature is great!!"""
__label__pos	My baby fits so comfy in this chair and I know she is going to use it for a long time.
__label__neu	The noises that came out of it were horrible.
__label__neu	0
__label__pos	The shoulder strap is padded and adjustable and comfy to carry over the shoulder.
__label__neg	Most tubs are non-slip,  that's what the little bumps are for in your tub
__label__pos	 Which makes it so much easier to get your baby latched on correctly. 
__label__pos	Amazing
__label__neg	 The holes punched in the cards were so small that when hooked onto the arms of the mobile they cracked (many arrived already cracked)
__label__neg	We hated that thing!
__label__neu	Tried several times after adjusting,  but never really work.
__label__neu	Trying to get everything to fit in it is a pain and time consuming & I have to do it in two or more rounds.
__label__neg	If you are only going to be pumping once in a blue moon,  then this is a great pump for you
__label__pos	The pillow is nice,  helps stabilize littler babies,  protects bigger ones from having accidents with their faces hitting the front bars of the carts
__label__neu	I was really struggling taking my 2 month old out in the cold.
__label__pos	I love that you can mix and match sounds with this sound soother - my girls like the womb sounds particularly
__label__pos	My son loves to fall asleep in it while I am working.
__label__pos	then they started walking and no longer like it but looking back this has been the most worthwhile investment of all the various infant toys.
__label__neu	Thought these would be a great learning bowl for my daughter to use.  
__label__pos	Very easy to fold and carry from location to location.
__label__pos	My baby likes to be snuggled so this is ideal. 
__label__pos	The Boppy helps you comfortably rest your baby while you nurse.
__label__neu	Our daughter is potty training right now and we have it ready for her whenever she needs it.
__label__neg	I was really really disappointed especially since it was a shower gift I had registered for from someone who splurged to get it for us!
__label__neu	The only time I have had problems with wipes drying out is when I have over filled it and the lid doesn't close tightly or I have accidently left it open.
__label__neg	Such a waste of money - we ended up turning it off and leaving all of the doors open to listen for the baby.
__label__pos	No complaints about this one.
__label__pos	I highly recommend this line of wearable blankets!
__label__pos	When they eventually arrived(1 week later)they proved to be quite useful during installation.
__label__pos	 They are easy to use
__label__neu	This product is dangerous.
__label__neu	I agree with the other moms that these are a little small, but if your newborn doesn't drink a whole four ounces at a time, it is great to be able to thaw only two ounces at a time. 
__label__neu	I hate to sound like a broken record but these do not stick.
__label__pos	It's a wonderful product and I don't know what we would do without it.
__label__neg	 Everytime he slept in it he woke up soaked in sweat
__label__neu	I ordered this sippy cup for my daughter because it was BPA free.
__label__pos	Store nice and works well for freezing
__label__pos	He was even great on these when switching between bottle and breast - no problems. 
__label__neu	This is my personal opinion, so your resluts could be totally different
__label__neg	I and my baby hated the bottles that come with it though.
__label__pos	 The bottles were great--durable and well-made
__label__neg	If you own this,  CHECK the strength of the left latch to the right.
__label__neu	I gave them to a friend who wanted to try them out.
__label__neg	It made my breasts look funny,  it made my nipples more irritable & it left painful marks on my breasts
__label__pos	They both have very soft pieces that go in his mouth and feel good...not rock hard!
__label__pos	This tub has really made bathing a lot easier and enjoyable for both my baby and I.
__label__neu	I had my warmer plugged it for 1 month and through it out
__label__neu	"""I wouldn't put anything super heavy in the drawers, just regular baby things should be fine."""
__label__neu	It heats so quickly though, that you don't have time to get distracted and leave the bottle to get too hot.  
__label__neg	The whole system is pretty heavy, and not nearly as portable as they try to tell you. 
__label__neg	receiver and monitor are in the same location with the same channel)- Random spikes in the volume of the receiverOverall, its not a good product and fisher price should be ashamed to have their name attached to it.
__label__neu	This gate is going back tomorrow.
__label__neg	The static is so loud, you can barely hear the baby.
__label__pos	Worth every penny.
__label__neu	I will NOT recommend,  sorry.
__label__neg	If I had the packaging I would return it.
__label__neg	 I have since returned the Snoogle
__label__pos	You only need 1 hand to use it.
__label__pos	 Very comfortable and gives the baby a wider and flater surface to lay on. 
__label__pos	So I just change it once a week and it's the best no expensive refills AND NO SMELLS!
__label__neu	We used one for about two weeks only to discover that our baby (who only weighed 7lb 8oz at birth) was too large for it!
__label__neu	Even on the lowest height setting she had to stand on her tip toes.  
__label__neu	As for me,  I have my pros and CONS
__label__pos	My baby seems to like it.
__label__neg	 This is a great idea in theory but for my curious son it is not practical
__label__neg	"""so, I do not recommend it..."""
__label__neu	I purchased this product 2 years ago for my son.
__label__neg	I wouldn't even say getting this as a pump for when you're on the go is a good idea because the leaking milk will get all over leaving you with clean up. 
__label__neu	I bought this primarily for the slip resistance and because it is BPA-free. 
__label__neu	She's outgrown the two small sized ones and still uses the large sized cotton one in addition to this large fleece one.
__label__pos	I never had a problem with them leaking.
__label__neg	I know several new mother's who bought in the ad hype about these bottles and ended up trashing them and buying something else
__label__neu	Don't waste your money buying pad covers.
__label__pos	"""He's been sitting up for months and still uses this chair."""
__label__neu	As for now I am currently using my bassinet w/o a sheet. 
__label__pos	"""These are perfect for when I don't want a really thick wash cloth for my baby."""
__label__pos	It's great for parent/baby interaction together.I wish I would have thought to hang something like this over my son's changing table when he was younger.I will say that the only drawback is that it doesn't have a hook to hang it, so you have to find a way to secure it to the ceiling.
__label__pos	The booster chair feels secure as it secures both behind and under the dining chair with buckle straps.
__label__neg	I love the idea of this sling and it is sturdy and attractive, but my 10 week old son just cannot get comfortable in it.
__label__pos	I like the evenflow glass bottles better, she wastes very little milk with those
__label__neg	Lastly it does not hold it's shape and flattens out over time even with barely any play time on it.
__label__neu	"""but it was a big hassle to wash (it takes forever to wash so many little parts with the tiny brush they give you)."""
__label__neu	Have not found a chair that we couldn't hook onto.CONS: lots of straps.
__label__neg	I threw mine out.
__label__pos	I'd much prefer to have the wipe warmer.
__label__pos	At 26 inches he still fits nicely in the infant side -- we have not yet moved to the deeper seated end for toddlers yet.
__label__neu	 But since I haven't found any other attachable cup holders that work I'm still using this one. 
__label__pos	On the positive side, it was simple to assemble and you can use it up to 40 lbs!
__label__pos	It has a hard cover which protects the silicon spout, which is great because the little one loves to drop her cup. 
__label__neg	When you press button on the small vechicle sometimes the audio is some laughter from children but personally I think that is a little bit scary.
__label__neu	My toddler twins won't be able to figure this one out! 
__label__neg	As far as being portable....that's a joke. 
__label__pos	They are much softer than the Gerber brand of liners (and being flushable is a huge plus).
__label__neg	Over time (2 years, in our case) the bottom edge of the inner ring has worn and warped from collision and abrasion with the refill package, and has become quite difficult to enter. 
__label__neg	Nothing seemed to make him happy except for me holding him while walking around.
__label__neu	I lay it on the bathroom counter and fill tHE sink with water. 
__label__neg	 Browns nursing pads the first month after my baby was born, I decided to go for the washable pads and wanted to use some organic cotton ones
__label__neg	 To be perfectly honest, it is rather a pain
__label__pos	Definitely worth the money
__label__pos	When swaddled he would scoot out of the positioner, but with the sleep sack his arms were above the positioner and he stayed in place.
__label__neg	 The Bjorn is uncomfortable for me after about an hour of wearing him in it - all his weight is carried by my shoulders and the so-called lumbar support really doesn't do too much
__label__pos	My son is 6 1/2 months old and goes nuts in this.
__label__neu	"""Our daughter started using this bouncer at about 2 months."""
__label__neu	This product is terrible.
__label__neu	I purchased this along with my Avent bottles before I had my daughter.
__label__neu	I use Avent bottles and Gerber baby food jars in it with no problems.  
__label__neg	All the pieces come apart from each other which is nice but also a problem if you're trying to keep it together.
__label__neu	Not a big deal, but would have been nice.
__label__neg	 Leg lifts off the ground when rocking
__label__neu	The only nice,  safe feature is the lights
__label__pos	 With summer here, I was more than excited to discover this thinner options
__label__pos	 The music choices are nice, and the natures sounds are great
__label__pos	Anyway, I bought the Munchkin brand and am super happy with them.  
__label__neu	So I took the cover off and put a knitted baby blanket in under the cover for extra padding.
__label__neg	My son slid down it every night.
__label__neu	We keep one at home and oone in the diaper bag for when we got out. 
__label__pos	I love the fact that the pillow cover is removable,  so that you can wash it
__label__neg	It's an OK product but if I wouldn't buy it again
__label__neu	The tray holds all types of bottles, caps, etc.
__label__pos	"""This one does not use Velcro and stays swaddled all night."""
__label__pos	 So you only hear the monitor when baby is making noise
__label__pos	He loves the image and the sounds (the water drops are his favorite). 
__label__pos	a must have
__label__neg	"""I have to clean it out every week if that, and even then, some of the crevices are too small for even a toothbrush to reach, so now I will have to resort to soaking it in a diluted bleach solution."""
__label__neu	When my first child was little,  I had a manual baby food grinder that worked wonderfully but it has been many,  many years since I had it and I don't remember the brand it was.
__label__pos	"""My son napped in this swing regularly as a newborn and it did not hamper his ability to transition to the crib when the time came."""
__label__pos	This product has worked great for us!
__label__neg	I have to change the bag every time she has a BM.
__label__pos	"""But as soon as we started using the Soft Cars potty seat we had instant success."""
__label__pos	It is extremely cute, with a face painted onto the front surface.  
__label__neu	Wouldn't it be nice if the fears of solid feeding could be alleviated?
__label__neu	There are far more things I dislike about it than like.
__label__neg	If you screw the top on crooked at all or too tightly - you may have issues.
__label__pos	We have never split a cabinet and we don't think it takes that much longer to install then any other cabinet locks.
__label__neg	This monitor is terrible! 
__label__neg	"""I say pass..."""
__label__neg	My disappointment with it is that the manufacturer left it to each and every customer to deal with the unfinished wood on their own
__label__pos	ProtectionThe Floppy Seat was especially useful when my son was smaller and had trouble sitting up straight in the seat
__label__neu	"""It's not a bad prouduct, I suggest emptying it out daily."""
__label__neg	You have to take time to stretch the elastic edges around the seat.
__label__neg	VERY USER UNFRIENDLY! 
__label__neu	I finally had to break down and replace my 9yr old playpen (that has been used by 4 children
__label__pos	Great choice!
__label__pos	I had doubts regarding the big size but it has turned out the best of this because I feel I have him free but secure at the same time
__label__pos	I bought this because of the wipe warmer, but it is terrible.
__label__neu	When our boy was about four months old we took him into Babies R Us to see what type of activity toys he might like.
__label__neg	That corny stuff is for the adults and taking pictures.
__label__pos	Before Katie was born I bought a plug in wall freshener unit in a pretty rose smell and her room always smelled so nice.
__label__pos	Bottom line: There is no perfect baby carrier for all ages and stages of development  but I think the Ergo is the best carrier out there for older babies.
__label__pos	SUCCESS!
__label__neg	At least one reviewer (maybe it was on the larger bottles; I read through those reviews too) seems to think the bubbles rising through the milk as the baby eats the milk is a bad sign.
__label__neg	It took us almost an hour to figure out how to get the thing CORRECTLY installed in the car the first time.
__label__pos	We love the 50s style designs, and these are very very soft for catching and wiping up spitup, and they stand up to heavy duty washing.
__label__neu	"They might like the doorway jumpers for a little longer since they can actually ""go"" somewhere, but then I was concerned about safety with a doorway jumper."
__label__neu	I worked in a hospital and we use to use these as burp rags.
__label__neu	Once again the world of baby gates shows that they have very little grasp on how real live houses are built.
__label__neu	 It is also VERY HOT
__label__pos	(Pacifica)  It actually takes up less room then her infant carrier.
__label__neu	Poor quality.
__label__neu	We've offered him other teethers but nothing appeals to him like his Sophie the Giraffe.  
__label__neu	Baby loves bathtime and is 6 months old.
__label__pos	"""I've been giving them for gifts."""
__label__neg	Don't waste your money on these bottles
__label__pos	"""Cleaning the floor isn't such a chore now."""
__label__neg	 Now I just grab my daughter, go to a chair/couch and find a comfortable pillow and do just fine without a boppy! 
__label__neu	I have tried using this since day one and every time I have used it,  it has hurt my back.
__label__neg	The motor weakened by the day. 
__label__neu	Not for long though now she rotates, jumps, pounces pulls and chews on the toys.  
__label__neg	 Don't waste your money!
__label__pos	"""Down with splash gaurds!"""
__label__neu	Sometimes he'll grab the giraffe with both hands around the neck and chew on the feet.  
__label__neu	When I tried to move the shade lower on the window I could not fully close the window.
__label__pos	This thermometer is the answer to one of a new mom's greatest fears.
__label__neu	Then I read the reviews of injurys cause by them.  
__label__neg	The pillow is said to be machine washable, but given the poor quality of the stuffing inside, do so at your own risk
__label__neu	Our diaper changing area was on the first floor in the laundry room.
__label__pos	"""We wish we purchased the rocker for her at home rather than the traditional bouncer."""
__label__neg	Next problem....it needs more water in front of the toys. 
__label__neu	So now,  not only did my wipes get too hot,  but I could not use the top wipe because it would be too dry.
__label__pos	"""I will be using this again when my third daughter comes in a few months."""
__label__neg	I have no idea how to warm a bottle in the car and have no reccomendations,  but I will tell you that this mini blood pressure machine will do nothing to benefit the appetite of an impatient child when she's hungry
__label__neu	They are much better than the Avent pads.
__label__pos	It's soft but not squishy, contoured so baby dosn't roll off, small and easy to store, machine washable, and babies love it!
__label__neg	I first purchased the Safety's First Tot Locks and it was so complicated to assemble I returned it to Amazon
__label__neg	The mobile was the hardest part.
__label__neg	I was excited when my husband brought it home since I had read some good reviews, however after placing my son in it his chin was on his chest and not comfortable for him at all. 
__label__neg	I only used it for about a month and it was such a pain
__label__pos	I have small breasts so I could wear them in any bra,  and I didn't have a huge leakage problem,  so I changed the foam twice a day
__label__neg	While I'm a stubborn Anglophile, I'm very disappointed by Avent's products. 
__label__pos	Best pack n' play!
__label__neu	I found that life was made easier if I put it on before I left my house and then when I got out of the car where I was going I could put the baby in.
__label__neg	I have 4 sisters all of whom registered for this and all of them got everything on their registries but this item (they all had big registries with at least 89 items experienced moms were smart enough to realize it was a waste of money) Also the thing about them yellowing and drying out is true. 
__label__neg	I don't see that they do anything for reducing swallowed air or anything else,  but they're fidgety and just extra pieces to clean
__label__neu	When I began my research for a potty chair for my son I had no idea how many things there were to consider!
__label__pos	My 7 month old has had this for about 2 months now, and he loves this toy. 
__label__neu	If you are a size 14+ you will want to look into a pillow that will fit you better,  because most likely,  this one will not be as helpful as it is for smaller women.
__label__neu	 I am going to see if the store has another one and put it together before I leave the store!
__label__neg	However the problem i had was assembling the two gate frames together with the locking parts,the instructions were not explicit enough.
__label__neu	2.  
__label__neu	These seat is too small for him.
__label__pos	Highly recommended!
__label__neu	Our daughter chewed on one and the hole got a LOT bigger and leaks like crazy now - you can buy replacements for $7 for a pair
__label__neu	before 2009 Medela baby bottles took the old style skinny base nipples.
__label__neu	with these cups she can drop it and they dog doesn't get all the contents!
__label__neu	Now we are using the SwaddleMe and I found she can't bunch it up anywhere near her neck.
__label__neu	I am a Family Childcare Provider in Massassachusetts. 
__label__pos	"""He loves the bright colors and he especially loves to teeth on the fish."""
__label__neu	"""old daughter and a 3 mo."""
__label__pos	She talks so much more now coos smiles laughs and just makes crazy noises and loves kicking the elephant rattle and looking at herself in the mirror.
__label__pos	They are absorbant and big enough to use.
__label__pos	I love being around horses and so this carrier allows me to run around the barn feeding and grooming without my little one getting underfoot.
__label__pos	You can take the gate part off when not needed yet it is safe enough for the top of the stairs.2.
__label__pos	"""and can accomodate as many as you need."""
__label__neu	I love all the Advent products,  but was a little disappointed with this one.
__label__neu	Too much trouble to have to assemble and disassemble and make sure all the parts get washed and dried and not misplaced.
__label__pos	 The outside zipper pockets are great for keys, cell, wallet, etc
__label__neu	My son grew out of his newborn tub REALLY fast (3- months- old) so I bought this as a replacement because it was the only one I could find that was big enough for him to bathe in comfortably (and he was still not ready for the adult tub).
__label__neu	She seems to also enjoy the musical star but I find it to be a bit annoying.
__label__neu	"""One of us would be sitting next to him."""
__label__neg	 Now the top part won't stay in place. 
__label__neu	drys overnight when its hung up.
__label__pos	The graphics and sides toys kept him more focused on fun & he was able to get some temporary relief.
__label__neg	Interestingly, my cup holder came with a warning sticker on the bottom that you're not supposed to use it with hot drinks -- I guess this is UPPAbaby's acknowledgement that the design doesn't work because it spills and thus could be dangerous with hot drinks. 
__label__neu	I didnt want to stratch the crib rails up so we took them back.
__label__neg	It also didn't clip on to his bassinet
__label__pos	Following a fit of 15 minutes of nonstop crying, she cried on and off for another 10 mintes to the vibrations and music, then passed out altogether.
__label__neg	We came to realize that the pail itself was absorbing the odors and we could not get rid of the stench no matter how much we washed it.
__label__neg	SO if you are pregnant,  don't make the same mistake that I did and buy a whole load of these bottles thinking that they are the best
__label__neg	"""They are made of cheap foam with plastic handles - that's IT! - and they wear out quickly."""
__label__pos	"""I can place him in the room with me and not worry that he will not be entertained!"""
__label__neu	It does fold nice and flat, but it is still large for the average car.
__label__neu	Our baby was able to bust out of a swaddle early on, even with the special velcro-ing (is that a verb?)
__label__pos	Wish we had bought it sooner.
__label__neu	
__label__pos	"""I tried wrapping around me and then I was pushed forward and I was uncomfy, but the baby was fine ;-) I just passed it on to a non-preggo cousin that has back problems."""
__label__pos	"""I felt like I could carry my son around for hours, unlike the Bjorn where after 15 minutes I was dieing."""
__label__pos	"""These cups are money well spent!"""
__label__neg	 I have to empty it every other day and it now goes through the refills really fast
__label__neg	We tried this one out since all the reviews I read were so good but unfortunately, we were not pleased with it. 
__label__neg	 First, it is very hard to lift to wring out after the bath
__label__neu	However,  it wasn't too long afterward that she started jumping around in it and staring at all the toys
__label__pos	"""And my life is so much easier since all I have to do is wash the nipples...."""
__label__pos	Overall, it is a wonderful seat.
__label__neu	He absolutely detested being smooshed awkwardly up against my chest, so we used an original bjorn carrier for his first few months.
__label__neu	I've put up 4 metal gates throughout the house so far,  and needed 2 more,  so I figured I would buy this since it's so much cheaper than the metal gates
__label__neu	I am replacing them.
__label__pos	My daughter loves playing with them and it is easy for her to take her toys in and out.
__label__neu	i was disappointed because the Avent bottles seemed as though they would be easier to clean and assemble than the Vent Aires.
__label__neu	I got this sterilizer after the birth of my daughter and trying to wash all my avent bottles and nipples.
__label__neu	I bought this as 2nd stroller, to park and short errand for my 4 months baby.
__label__neu	Trust me
__label__pos	Extensively Crash TestedReinforced SteelEasy to cleanEasy to adjustMost cushy seat of booster/car seats.
__label__neg	 Of course the ones they replace it with also leak
__label__neu	They leaked no matter how many times I tried and followed the directions.
__label__neg	I'm so annoyed with this product
__label__neg	I didn't give it 5 stars because we had a problem adjusting the crotch strap.
__label__neg	The negatives there were a) sticky glue residue on the leather and b) when we need to fold down the rear seat for transporting bikes or something equally large, the rear seat would fold precisely right down where the mirror would be, so we'd be constantly removing it and the velcro tape and then reattaching it. 
__label__pos	"""I figured they were cute and she didn't want much for them."""
__label__neu	apep@chartermi.
__label__neg	 They bend up the matteress so bad I can't even use them
__label__neg	I have to say that it is a waste of money.
__label__pos	"""I'm surprised that even now that she is a skilled walker she still enjoys spending time in it."""
__label__neg	"""This monitor was terrible."""
__label__pos	My son has never flinched when touched by the wipes or signaled in any other way of the wipes being cold
__label__neu	When my daughter was first born we bought a bath sponge in the shape of a bear that was about 2 inches thick. 
__label__pos	for the same price or less, the Eddie Bauer sheets are such a steal! 
__label__pos	Would buy again!
__label__neg	Not a very good cloth diaper. 
__label__neg	We used a nipple shield by Medela but as she got older the nipple shield was just not cutting it when it came to my baby being full.
__label__neg	more of a toy than a teether and it does have a horrible smell that we cant cure.... 
__label__pos	"""I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!"""
__label__neu	I did try beacuse I wanted to make sure I exhausted all methods of using the swing.
__label__neu	I got a Sunshine Kids after this and it fastened so tightly and securely in the rear-facing position,  I wonder how any baby is safe in a different seat.
__label__neu	As soon as we changed her bottles to the Dr.
__label__pos	It is a leisurely bath for everyone!
__label__pos	My son loves to dance to music now.
__label__pos	"""impressive considering some of the dirty diapers I have seen my son produce."""
__label__pos	Something like this is a great idea,  but when I called to ask the fire dept.
__label__neg	craziness.
__label__neg	My only concern is that my son has already figured out how to snap off the tray insert by reaching his hand over and pulling up on the lip of the insert.
__label__pos	The incline was just enough to help with our son's reflux problem so he wouldn't be laying flat after eating. 
__label__neu	The range is not close to 2000 feet.
__label__neu	i don't use that though, because i put the tub on the floor.
__label__neu	It goes in the washer and the dryer.
__label__pos	"""We love this tub and so does our daughter!"""
__label__neu	Count less hours of fun and price less smiles.
__label__pos	She loves the colors and likes to see the liquid inside this cup.
__label__neg	speaker could be a little louder.
__label__neu	I ended up with a free brand new medela hand pump from WIC(if I had only asked from the get go). 
__label__pos	Perfect when they're newborn.
__label__neg	 My first complaint is that the first few diapers wont stay wrapped
__label__pos	Now that she is over the colic she still loves the swaddle me blankets.
__label__neg	And the plug is waaaaay too hard to plug -  it's an enormous effort to plug it each time.
__label__neg	 I hope this isn't happening to others
__label__pos	My daughter is now 2 weeks old and actually loves this chair.
__label__neg	The cup's parts do pull apart for easy cleaning but the spout is very hard to get back into the lid and almost impossible to line up exactly right.
__label__neg	Since the safest place for a baby is in the headrest-less center, the strap was out. 
__label__pos	So easy to use and much more accurate than the ear thermometers (dont EVER buy one of those, theyre a complete waste of money and dangerous to your baby by being so inaccurate!!)
__label__neg	The mobile toys are too low as my baby is always trying to reach up to them where as w/ another swing I have he just looks and enjoys.
__label__neu	It is entirely static because of some interference with either the cordless phone or the wireless internet connection in my house.
__label__pos	I also like how there is a built in way to clip the cover to a cord.
__label__pos	The fleece one, however, is aweseom (even though I like the LullaBag slightly better than the Halo fleece sleep sack)
__label__neu	If you have a Next Generation or any other large, sleigh type crib.forget it. 
__label__neu	I purchased this item because of the great reviews it got here,  but I am not impressed.
__label__neu	and this is it.
__label__pos	Easy to grip.
__label__pos	"""I got it as a shower gift and hadent heard of it before but when I started using it I had to tell all my friends."""
__label__neg	I have to see if I can find anything that works better for me.
__label__pos	I love this monitor and am so glad I purchased it!
__label__pos	ALSO, IT IS BPA-FREE!
__label__neu	I ended up using a regular old baby tub, which if I twisted just the right way, fits under my bathroom sink.I was using this with a newborn, perhaps it would be better with an older baby.
__label__neg	Being the excited new mom I opened this to get a feel for it and see how it would fit in our home and almost cut my finger sliding it open
__label__neg	I'm much happier with the Playtex nurser bottles with the drop ins.
__label__pos	It would make a terrific gift.
__label__neu	Two are jersey and are now getting  little small for him.
__label__neu	I wish the end would be made of clips that operate like a clothes pin and velcro on the other end for easier paci removal.
__label__neu	It's lightweight.3. 
__label__pos	It is so much easier and much less messy.  
__label__pos	"""Our daughter is now 11 months and we still use it, she is only like 16 lbs, and she still loves it!"""
__label__pos	Great product, nice tunes.
__label__pos	"""My baby didn't have a problem switching from breast to bottle at all."""
__label__neu	when i became pregnant i planned on using these bottles, i bought everything bottle warmer,sterilizer,breast pump, and a ton of bottles and nipples
__label__pos	We'll use them with our next baby and will recommend to them to ANYONE that will listen.
__label__pos	This cart cover COVERS everything
__label__pos	and only needs to be changed weekly,  every 8-9 days)- refill does not last very long
__label__pos	"""We registered for this product after hearing raves from other people."""
__label__neu	i just recently tried the wide neck Dr. Browns and like them even better than the standard dr browns.
__label__neu	When I was pregnant and shopping for the nursery, I was torn between what type of bumper to buy. 
__label__pos	"""I am so happy I did because I was able to relieve the engorgement enough so that she was able to feed."""
__label__pos	The lights and music did a great job calming my baby and still does!
__label__neg	I purchased these at Baby's R Us because of the good reviews, but I have not had any luck with them. 
__label__neu	She instantly began squealing and playing with the toys.  
__label__neu	Baby arrived
__label__pos	 We love it because it swings two ways
__label__pos	I have heard good things about 'my breast friend' I might try that one next time. 
__label__neu	"""Check on line for these items."""
__label__pos	I haven't used other tubs to compare this one to, but it met our needs just fine.  
__label__pos	"""I would and have purchased these bottles again."""
__label__neg	Like other reusable pads, I won't wear them away from home because they could leak through, and they are more bulky and so can be seen through my clothing.
__label__neg	 I cut small holes to pull the straps through, and they were all frayed after just one washing. 
__label__neg	These are cute and definitely a conversation piece, but they DO NOT WORK!  
__label__pos	I would definitely buy this again.
__label__pos	"""It's a really nice addition to the chair."""
__label__neu	I own this product and the Baby Bjorn.
__label__neg	In the end, my daughter took the Gerber NUK for about a month and then refused all pacifiers all together.
__label__neg	I used this tub for the first 6 months of my son's life, and I never really liked it
__label__neg	But the problem is that there's so much static that you can barely hear the sounds that it picks up.
__label__neu	There is just a little bump that is supposed to be the part that your baby stradles to be able to sit in the tub.
__label__pos	"""The seat is comfortable and safe, the motor is strong and quiet, the mobile is a nice touch, and the seat cover is easy to clean."""
__label__pos	Contrary to other reviewers, I prefer the Diaper Genie to both the Diaper Champ and the Diaper Dekor, in part because of superior containment of smell. 
__label__pos	"A couple weeks later and now she is very happy with it, and putting on her ""sleepy coat"" is part of her bedtime ritual.  "
__label__neg	I was very disappointed. 
__label__neu	My wife has the large Bugaboo she uses all the time, but I needed a stroller for our one year old to keep in the trunk of my convertible (BMW M3).
__label__neg	"It is cute that the manual says ""do not drill through the door, "" hugh?"
__label__pos	 Buy the Eddie Bauer mirror, it's a better buy
__label__neg	I received this as a gift, unforutnately it didn't fit on our stroller (pretty standard Graco Travel System) or on our carseat (either our Grace or our Marathon) and so it was pretty useless.
__label__neu	All those cute receiving blankets are really useless for anything other than wiping up drool.
__label__neu	Gary Peterson
__label__neu	Also,  what happens if say the door cracks while I drill?
__label__neg	Also, it's near impossible to warm this bottle up if you have cold formula.
__label__pos	My favorite feature is that it doesn't require special refills--it can use any trash bag (we just use a tall kitchen trash bag).
__label__neu	"""The big tub is just so much easier and nicer and there isn't any preparation, everything is there, it's easy to fill and drain and always worked well with my first child."""
__label__pos	It is a breeze to take down and set up -- we take it everywhere.
__label__neu	To keep the swaddle from riding up over baby's face you have to remember to tightly fasten the bottom velcro around the waist.
__label__neg	My husband says he will try drilling a hole in it and attaching it to the door with a screw.
__label__pos	) because their price is the best, and they are really nice if you need to return a defected item
__label__neg	 The drawcord needs to be knotted to avoid danger of strangulation (very unsafe, not to mention inconvenient for adjusting)
__label__pos	Ameda customer service was good when I had a problem.
__label__pos	It has nice music (not too mechanical or tinny sounding) and plays for a good amount of time - about 15 minutes.  
__label__pos	"The baby is not submerged under water, and the hammock is soft so it cradles and conforms to the baby, unlike all the other ""hard"" tubs out there. "
__label__pos	My son was a couple of weeks old and I was in LOVE with this cover.
__label__pos	Distributes the weight well- easy to carry!
__label__pos	 The directions were clear and the dresser is sturdy enough to work well for clothing and baby blankets
__label__neu	Also,  I have yet to get it to shrink,  so I have this huge tub in the bathroom all the time.
__label__neu	With each baby, I bought this product by Munchkin.
__label__neg	In the first wash, the seams started to fray a bit and the color faded right away.
__label__neg	 i didn't return it because i was going to have to buy as much for the shipping as i did for the pump. 
__label__pos	It fit perfectly around my middle so me and the baby could be comfortable during feedings. 
__label__neu	I wouldn't say I am very happy with this pillow.
__label__pos	She said that it did a good job and I didn't have to buy any special bags. 
__label__neu	I found that when having a baby,  keep it simple and LESS IS MORE.
__label__neu	"""I bought this changing table with the matching Delta Jenny Lind crib from another store (shop around for the best price)."""
__label__neu	SO we got a new bathroom and the thing still doesn't work.
__label__neg	after a month shield began to loose its shape.
__label__pos	This was a great buy and worth it for our trip. 
__label__pos	SO its a KEEPER!
__label__neu	I don't have a problem with the small storage area underneath, or the lack of cup-holders.
__label__pos	I haven't had any issues with rolling wrinkling etc
__label__pos	you have to use your index finger to press it and its actually hard to do so.
__label__neu	Get the old fashion one that us parents have a hard time getting out.
__label__neg	 Material is kinda rough. 
__label__neg	I really didn't find much use for it though.
__label__neu	Not pretty,  but bigger and much sturdier.
__label__neu	It was not practical or safe for me to reach back behind myself while driving.
__label__neu	You can then push the gate open with a hand or a knee
__label__neg	It would release, so I had to let air in every so often so my nipples wouldn't get sucked into the bottle! 
__label__neg	I had the 3.
__label__neu	 I installed it correctly and put my son in it. 
__label__pos	A MUST HAVE for new mothers and fathers!
__label__pos	Now that it's together I can't wait for baby to try it.
__label__pos	I already had the Orbit system and this stroller seat is great.
__label__neu	Alright, so these really do a great job of keeping out the sun, but boy are they ugly.
__label__neg	I found it awkward to put together.
__label__neu	We hung these bugs on my daughter's car seat and swing when she was just two months old.
__label__neu	!.....I'm pretty sure there is a recall.
__label__neg	Leaks horribly, bulky - we gave up, returned it, and now we just bath with baby.
__label__pos	"""This sterilizer holds Avent bottles (even the 9oz) perfectly!"""
__label__neu	"""The refrigerator storage system is great too, you have to check out the website to understand what I mean."""
__label__pos	It's actually easier to see the baby with the monitor than in person at night.
__label__neg	 One wall we had to replaster and I will have to repaint when I have the time
__label__neg	Nice cup but the spout needs to be redesigned.
__label__neg	I am returning it back to the store.
__label__pos	"""It helps me a lot when I have to take a shower of do laundry."""
__label__neg	I hated every sound it made. 
__label__neg	" Wouldn't waste your money on this ""intro"" utensil"
__label__neu	I even took this in the car with me on road trips.
__label__pos	The bath fits well and is small enough to store easily.
__label__neu	It's not as solid and a great disappointment.
__label__pos	"""She loves the toys on this too."""
__label__neg	It says top shelf dishwasher safe,  but after running it through the the temperature sticker started coming off and the top 'cap' no longer held in place
__label__pos	She loves it, it keeps her busy, and I get some time to do a chore or two around the house.
__label__neg	Eventually I found a better place to keep it next to baby,  however the wipes kept getting stuck in the bottom part of the warmer so i eventually got tired of lifting the cover and pushing the wipes through to the top
__label__pos	=p)And by having her own table she does not really touch the restaurant table which I like to avoid in any case (due to hygiene reason).
__label__neg	 For nursey furniture, stick with your local dealer
__label__neg	She sucked it a few times and then rejected it.
__label__pos	"""It's nice to know that what you are giving your child has been sterilized well."""
__label__neg	 I actually beat it with a hammer when I took it down after my first child quit using it. 
__label__neg	It's too small for standard contoured changing pad
__label__neu	Now I know this is primarily my fault
__label__neu	"""We were visiting friends who have a Bumbo..."""
__label__pos	This is a great product - sturdy,  good-looking,  but there are better products out there
__label__neu	I was skeptical about using this because my daughter hated the sleepsack as a younger baby.  
__label__pos	Then after a couple more months he really enjoyed being able to sit up (when he was able) instead of being reclined the whole time which made bath- time a LOT easier.
__label__neu	We find it easier to simply have Baby bathe with Mommy or Daddy.
__label__neu	I think this is because it is no wider than a wheelchair would be and most building accommodate that.
__label__neu	I even bought some odor discs but they didn't work either.
__label__neg	I also tried the SoftFit which didn't do a thing for me.
__label__neg	I had a Safety 1st potty that I just hated before I bought this Baby Bjorn potty.
__label__pos	That has always worked for us.
__label__neg	And the wipes fall out all the time
__label__pos	Now, when I change my daughter, there are no more tears and no more washing the changing table pad either!
__label__pos	Moms and dads you need this swing!!
__label__neg	"""I am still on the search for the perfect baby carrier..."""
__label__pos	It's perfect!
__label__neg	First, we read the directions and we follwed them
__label__pos	Love the new style of bottles.
__label__pos	"""It's lightweight, so if they hit their head toppling over, it doesn't hurt because it's hollow."""
__label__neu	I now have the Essentials Bag.
__label__neu	If this cost $[...] i may consider buying it.
__label__pos	"""Love it."""
__label__neg	Save your money
__label__neu	He slides around too much in the regular tub, and this keeps him more under control, and it uses much less water than filling up the whole tub.
__label__neu	I'll admit that I was skeptical 
__label__neg	 It still stinks
__label__pos	The big fluffy pillow is perfect for those babies that are still wobbly but sitting up.
__label__neg	 I would recommend to keep looking
__label__pos	"""the extra steps are worth it to me."""
__label__neu	Second,  it didn't provide enough support for my head and I needed another pillow.
__label__neu	The lights are also a bit annoying b/c they will only continue to play if the baby grabs the fishes hanging
__label__neg	"No matter how hard I pressed on the middle ""locking"" device water always leaked out onto the counter and floor"
__label__neg	"""Overall, I wish I'd kept the box because I am so dissatisfied with this toy that I would return it if I could."""
__label__neg	After just a month or so of use,  the spoon color started to fade and bleed and change to a brownish yellow stain on each one
__label__neg	I'm only 51 and already have very bad arthritis pain in my knees hips foot and sometimes back.
__label__neg	I bought these because I wanted very badly to breastfeed my daughter but we were having latch-on problems
__label__neg	 For some reason it leaks out of the spary part
__label__neu	I have used it for 7 months now and had to go buy a different one. 
__label__neg	I wish they would have made the spout larger.
__label__pos	fun for the whole family
__label__neg	 I compared the old with the new and it is different
__label__pos	This bottle is by far the best bottle I have ever used.
__label__neg	Eventually,  on all 3 that I went through,  the milk builds up in the piece that attaches to the bottle (only takes a few pumps to fill this up) and you have to break suction for it to filter through
__label__pos	"""The adapter is easily attached and detached from the stroller for times when you want to put on the other Uppababy parts like the bassinet or seat."""
__label__pos	"""The tub has been great since she was a newborn, and weighed in at 7 lbs."""
__label__neg	 Also, the music is really low as the speaker is on the bottom and it gets muffled
__label__neg	And the label doesn't tell you what kind of plastic,  at a time when parents want to know what kind of plastic is in their baby's products
__label__pos	"""My baby loved this when she first sat in it."""
__label__neu	I went to the Avent website and they said that I was overtightening the bottles and that was causing the leak
__label__neu	(...)When your child outgrows the infant bath (between two and six months, depending on size and activeness), get a bigger baby bath. 
__label__neg	Second,  it doesn't move very long or fast on carpet
__label__neu	She didn't like room temp wipes at first but now she expects them at room temp and doesn't mind diaper changes at all!
__label__neg	instructions were vague
__label__neu	I wanted a snap- n- go type stroller for our Chicco Keyfit carseat.
__label__pos	The door is secure and safe.  
__label__neg	 I would also recommend getting through (
__label__neu	(&quot;Attica, Attica!&quot;) 
__label__pos	"""3)  Lightweight, so you can move it around the house without even having to take it apart"""
__label__neu	"Warmers stated ""will not yellow the wipes"""
__label__pos	It works and there is not any feedback and we're in a small place. 
__label__neu	I ended up buying this one. 
__label__neg	 I wouldn't recommend this potty for larger children
__label__pos	She can be entertained indefinitely with this.
__label__neg	We're awake while our baby is peacefully sleeping.
__label__neu	Even 5 year olds still cannot open it.
__label__neu	The toy was designed for children.  
__label__pos	this bib is a lifesaver, and an outfit saver.
__label__neg	When we use unwarmed wipes my baby gets more upset at changes.
__label__neg	 It is now put away and I will never put it up again. 
__label__pos	I got this from our shower and even though I never nursed, I still found this boppy very helpful.
__label__neu	We got this product a little late, my son was 2 months old... 
__label__neu	 If you are pumping full time, you will be storing alot more than 4 bottles at a time. 
__label__neu	Unfortunatly there does not seem to be any other choices so I still use the covers,  but I also lay a waterproof multi-use pad over the top.
__label__neg	Though the music played,  the mobile didn't go around as it was supposed to
__label__pos	"It was easy to assemble.When it arrived our son ""helped"" with assembling and transitioned from crib to bed without any tears."
__label__neu	I have used NOTHING from it
__label__pos	"""would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a convertible car seat or even a regular carseat."""
__label__neg	Sigh.
__label__neg	I was very disappointed and returned this bottle
__label__neu	More bad news... I purchased the Ultimate Wipes Warmer,  which will not fit on top of the depot while it is hanging on the side of the changing table.
__label__neg	I would rather just empty the trash can once a day then mess with this thing
__label__neg	 If motivated, you could probably make your own sturdier mobile--the patterns are available online
__label__neu	When our Fisher-Price 900 MHZ monitor (bought in 2002) finally died this year,  we decided to read the latest reviews before selecting a new one.
__label__neu	"""Instead to make the plastic where she lays a little comfier we put in a hand towel to lay on."""
__label__pos	My 6 month old rides in it with no trouble, and it will easily accomodate her growing little body for well over a year.
__label__neu	 We decided to try it without the ring and it was a little challenging holding him in place while washing him, but we managed. 
__label__pos	The bottles do not leak,  like I have read in the other reviews.
__label__neg	She had some of the clear pacifiers and they were so hard to find if they fell or got misplaced.
__label__neu	I might have to try out my sisters in person before I decide if I will reorder the Ocean Wonders.
__label__neu	"""I have a 3 month old and have basically used the plastic tub a total of 3 times."""
__label__pos	"""Since we just change to this hands free gate, we are so relieved."""
__label__neu	It reminds me a bit of burt's bees lip gloss.
__label__neu	Sometimes we will put socks on her and keep her feet out
__label__neu	Frustrating...A very bad experience with a product that worked very poorly for me.
__label__neu	Also know that most toilet seat and lids have a little white plastic cover that goes over the screws that attach the lid to the toilet
__label__neg	it just rolls and if you want to leave it on the table for a second (cos moms do need all of thier limbs all the time) forget it
__label__neg	Beyond yucky
__label__neu	"""We have 2 toddlers and have bought many gates."""
__label__neg	 It was ripping in the corners, and no matter how gentle I was, the hole got bigger
__label__neg	DO NOT WASTER YOUR MONEY ON THIS TUB
__label__pos	"""Money well spent!!!!!!"""
__label__neg	 Right now, this toy is in storage
__label__neu	Anyone with a newborn knows that is precious, precious time for you to do something else, while keeping an eye on the baby, of course.  
__label__neg	" You cannot warm it with the ""sleeve"" (well, you could, it'd take forever), but you cannot warm it nipple-down without the milk leaking out"
__label__pos	It folds compactly with one hand (wonders when you're holding a chunky squirmer), turns on a dime, and the handles are comfortable for extended walks.
__label__neu	After a month,  however,  both my babies started getting their hands and/or fingers trapped and pinched in the two sides with spinning wood blocks.
__label__pos	Very good booster
__label__pos	"""He's very comfortable in it since it cradles him & I love the idea that it can be used for so long."""
__label__neg	 Good way to ruin an otherwise good product
__label__neu	 I bought the tie on cloth cover for the front rail of the crib, and decided to try to save some money on a cover for the side rails
__label__pos	The handles offer added security for early potty use
__label__neu	He is 30 inches tall and about to outgrow the medium, so we have a large ready for him.
__label__neg	 I received this as a shower gift and tried using it the first few days when he came home, but he really didn't like feeling constrained
__label__neg	 They get very gross on the inside and I cant seem to ever get them clean
__label__pos	A top 5 I couldn't live without
__label__pos	Whenever we are out and he gets upset, I pull or swing the bugs and he stops.
__label__pos	I would get a couple sizes so you can continue to use them as you little one grows.
__label__neu	It is probably always helpful to test for leaks (when you test the temp of the milk) BEFORE you give it to the baby, just to make sure.
__label__pos	They are easily to hold (thanks to the curve) and I really like the wide mouth of the bottles which make them easy to clean.
__label__neg	Just wish we never registered for this product
__label__neu	I can't see if they are real close or far away or not there at all.
__label__pos	"""It is very slim so it is not very distracting and easy to use."""
__label__pos	I would recommend it to any active mom!
__label__neg	 It would have made more sense to have it unplug directly from the case
__label__neu	My son is 5 weeks old and I stopped using this 3 1/2 weeks ago
__label__neu	I think she could probably get it off if she wanted to but she doesn't even try anymore.
__label__neu	Don't get the plus, and get the old model
__label__pos	It is great for when I have to shop alone, because I don't have to worry about putting his infant car seat into a shopping cart, which gives me extra room for purchases.
__label__neg	"""They are not sold separately."""
__label__pos	I like that this garment is flame resistant, that it is spacious and sleeveless, but that's about it.
__label__pos	This mobile is calming & soothing.
__label__pos	I was amazed.
__label__neu	My daughter took the Avent for about two weeks
__label__neu	"""I've returned 4 of them immediately after seeing how the design of the seat would not work for our son (I would have a little Bellagio Fountain spraying on my floor instead of the toilet)."""
__label__neu	This particular bottle is NOT BPA FREE!  
__label__neu	These are the exact caps that came with my pump, so I have no complaints other than I wish Ameda made them a bit sturdier.
__label__neg	 Even if she had liked it, I would have worried that I would hurt her head with my chin
__label__neu	First,  I don't think it speaks english
__label__pos	The whole family can sit at the table to eat and when I need my hands for myself, my son has the Baby Safe Feeder and jsut about any juicy food I want to put in it.
__label__neg	It was just not needed
__label__pos	 The padding is sufficient and I love that it flips over to convert to a stool... 
__label__pos	"""She loves her new big girl seat & my husband and I love how safe it is & the fact that it converts so she can use it until she's about 8 years old."""
__label__pos	The only one that is safe and works.
__label__pos	"""My husband can even bath him and he looks really comfy in it."""
__label__neg	The wood is very weak and breaks very easily.  
__label__neg	Put the twenty bucks in your kid's college fund instead.
__label__neu	one with and wiltout handles
__label__neg	Unless your child has a lot of trouble picking things up from any other plate or bowl, though, I see no reason to buy this plate. 
__label__pos	"""Well worth the money!"""
__label__neu	One of my nipples is still sore but that's because of how I am putting him on I think because my other one I can barely feel now when he's on and he's almost 2 weeks old.  
__label__pos	Don't wait to get it though, you'll be sorry.
__label__pos	It is so great keeps baby busy and entertained and smiling so big that even though you want to put them in it to get some dishes done you are held captivated at their happiness we dont get much done these days but to sit and watch her be happy always worth it!
__label__neu	One other issue is and at the same time it's a positive I guess is that because these pads are kind of like a diaper in the sense of being absorbent and having that extra layer,  you don't always know until you happen to touch one of the pads that it's completely soaked through for who knows how long
__label__neg	If you don't turn it inside out, the sleeves have a hard time drying on the inside where the absorbent fabric is.
__label__pos	"""The wipes fit perfectly on one side of the caddy, and we always have diapers and other items on the other side and in the drawer."""
__label__pos	It's very soft and very comfy for little ones the blanket that comes with it is great and my son loved the vibrate motion!
__label__neg	 I purchased the Sounds and Light Monitor instead 
__label__neu	I bought this chair for my 5 month old to go out to dinner with
__label__pos	The best part is that the sponge is less than $4 and you can use it anywhere- the kitchen sink,  tub,  etc
__label__neg	Very dissappointed
__label__neg	- leak all over everything if baby tips the bottle over on its side if he tips it upside down FORGET ANY CHANCE THAT IT MIGHT NOT LEAK
__label__neg	So unless you like a smelly house and have 3 arms to change a bag dont buy!!
__label__neu	 I will probably buy another one just so she can distinguish the difference. 
__label__neg	There was one bottle that for whatever reason leaked when I shook the bottle to mix it.
__label__pos	"""I was actually able to get them to work on stairs without adaptor plates but it takes some creativity."""
__label__neg	"""What were these manufacturers thinking?!"""
__label__pos	"""She was fascinated by the spinning starfish and the bubbles."""
__label__pos	I got this from my sister for my baby shower and we love love love it!
__label__pos	Very convenient.
__label__pos	Update at 4.5 months age:  I stand by my statement above in that this is a great product - IF you use it.  
__label__pos	I've inflated this within a couple of minutes with no problem.
__label__neg	They curve outward instead of following the natural curve of the breast, making them visible under any type of shirt or sweater.
__label__neg	Don't buy it
__label__neu	My newborn is a very aggressive sucker, and would gulp her bottles down as quickly as she could, choking and coughing so frequently that it made ME anxious every time I had to feed her. 
__label__neg	Brown's bottles but the combination didn't work for us
__label__pos	I loved this chair and if I had seen them earlier would have bought one for our house instead of a regular bouncy seat and may still get one when she outgrows the bouncy (it has a vibrating function like the bouncy which has always helped her take naps better
__label__neg	I have read other reviews and I know other people have had the same problem. 
__label__pos	This is the perfect gift for new mommies It even has a lanyard so you dont have to carry it around or have to wear a belt.
__label__neg	I used it for a few days until I realized it was so much easier to use my dishwasher.
__label__neg	I bought this despite hearing that it is too hard, and now I wish I would have listened
__label__neu	And I read all the instructions before attempting to play with it so I could do it correctly
__label__pos	Yeah Kiddopotamus!
__label__pos	The only positive thing I can say is that when you do cut the links loose they are easy to dispose of in the outside garbage.
__label__neg	Beware!
__label__neg	I feel that this is a safety issue, if you have this swing or get this swing please don't ever take your eyes off of your baby, I was in the same room just with my back to him. 
__label__pos	They have great tooth for grabbing the poo. 
__label__neu	Finally I tried the Miracle Blanket
__label__pos	You will have to drill in you cupboard doors but your little one(s) will be protected.
__label__pos	He is eight months old and I wish I had tried it sooner.
__label__neg	), and was doing a mess, with milk dripping everywhere
__label__neg	 In the recommended time it was hot enough to leave blisters on my wrist when I tested it
__label__pos	It is great if they want to hold it or keep it on the charger,  it doesn't get hot.
__label__neg	 There were so many bubbles in the bottle that I could hear them
__label__pos	Then she goes crazy!
__label__neu	Sure my hand got a little tired but its not bad plus its good exercise.  
__label__neg	 It would take both my husband and I pulling on it to get them to budge and even then we could not get them tight enough to really be considered safe. 
__label__pos	But for keeping them awake and entertained these are great.
__label__neu	We started with the Diaper Genie as most new parents do.
__label__pos	But I bought one anyway and quickly realized that this is not only the best teether on the market, it's also one of the best toys in general for 4-6 month olds.  
__label__pos	"""It looks like an expensive bag and when you open it , it is a big blanket which is very soft inside and waterproof outside."""
__label__pos	"""I love that the seat is more upright than laid back."""
__label__pos	They are great to put snacks in and toss in the diaper bag.
__label__neg	Piece of junk
__label__neg	I absolutely hate these cups! 
__label__neu	I have a 2 month old and I just do not feel comfortable using this carrier.
__label__neu	The seat tilted to one side, which was fine until he started getting too big. 
__label__neg	 I touched the mirror and it wasn't fog
__label__neg	 We returned it and bought the Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer
__label__pos	It says that it holds about 20 diapers, but when your baby is little, and using diapers through size 2, you can turn them sideways so that you can actually fit in twice as many in two rows instead of just one.
__label__pos	Another cool feature is that you can have the handles on, or not.
__label__pos	I cannot imagine learning to breastfeed without a Boppy.
__label__neu	NOW I JUST USE WIPES THAT ARE NOT LINKED AND LIFT THE LID.
__label__neu	It's kind of a pain to reshape;(which is why it got 4 stars) but once you have it together it's pretty sturdy.
__label__neg	 In fact, I call it awful
__label__neu	I had this in an older version (didn't have the radio feature) for my 2 sons.
__label__neg	This was a waste of money.
__label__neu	I may as well recycle it,  because it's been collecting dust ever since.
__label__pos	There's a fish mobile that spins, a light that changes colors (very cool) and your choice of noises that range from music to waves and it swings on top of that!
__label__pos	If you ever need to lay your baby down somewhere secure and don't have time to prep it,  this bath pad makes a handy pad that keeps your child in position.
__label__pos	Buy this monitor!
__label__neg	I bought this because of the excellent reviews, so I felt it necessary to add my review that is not as positive
__label__neu	Wipes are not cheap and wasting a wipe is for that purpose is silly.
__label__neg	We have had much better luck in public toilets using theKalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Blue
__label__pos	"a ""must have"" for the BOB stroller"
__label__neu	We can put it in our Suburban.
__label__neu	Pros
__label__pos	"""4.  The base seems much more sturdy."""
__label__neu	This is the only bottle warmer I have ever used so I really have nothing to compare it to
__label__neg	 Then he managed to stuff one of the long legs deep into his mouth and started to gag
__label__neu	For side sleeping it keeps my knees from having to touch which causes great pain quickly.
__label__neg	If you aren't super-skinny,  you will never get that pillow around your waist
__label__pos	I used the Playtex bottles w/ the disposable liner and it made my life much easier
__label__pos	Very cheap and durable. 
__label__neg	You can get the water to almost boiling.
__label__neu	I name all of my DD's toys but I think this is this toy's actual name: Patty Panda.
__label__neu	The right latch (when facing forward) did NOT latch tight compared to the left one.
__label__pos	They can be thrown in the washing machine when they get too dusty and hold up well.
__label__neg	My baby does not have 5+ mins to wait...nor do I! 
__label__neu	I kept thinking she just needed to get used to the nipple flow, so I stuck with it.
__label__pos	"""I also like that you can open the gate & walk through."""
__label__neg	 I think I used them once and sold them
__label__pos	"""Perfect!"""
__label__neg	We really need a footed sleep sack for our baby now that the temps are getting colder but I have no options because this comes in only size L or XL, the large saying 12-18 months which should fit my son but it is the hugest thing. 
__label__pos	"""It was very easy for us to set up (although I think it would be quite difficult for just one person to do)."""
__label__pos	(We've just avoided putting banana in it which I hear is the worst culprit for sticking to the mesh  It's been used so far with cantaloupe watermelon and apricots without trouble.
__label__neu	I bought this for a 12 hour road trip with my 19 month old son.  
__label__neg	I am so unhappy and fustrated with these monitors
__label__pos	This is sturdy, easy to use, easy to find things in (versus the hanging stroller bags).  
__label__neu	Very difficult to clean by hand (take something else on vacation!) and not all that convenient even when you do have a dishwasher at hand.
__label__pos	The drop-in refills are very inexpensive and are more than worth the money in the time it saves.
__label__pos	We felt like overprotective first time parents when we purchased this monitor, but are so happy that we did.  
__label__neu	 Of course, we use glass bottles so there is more weight on the parts than if we used plastic, but the top part is where we put the bottle tops, nipples, etc. 
__label__neg	don't bother with these
__label__pos	My pro is I can see my son at all times
__label__pos	It was a Godsend,  and takes up very little space
__label__pos	Great stackability
__label__pos	"""She is very comfortable in this exersaucer."""
__label__neu	Also,  keep in mind your wash loads
__label__pos	The sterilizer works great, simply, and fast!
__label__neg	"""So if you ever plan on using your cellphone while your baby is sleeping, this isn't the monitor for you."""
__label__pos	"""It works fine but cleaning the tubes and getting it set up is a hassle."""
__label__pos	Plus when it was on our daughter seemed to be drawn to it
__label__pos	This really beats having to boil bottles on the stove like we did for my first two children and saves us a lot of time and energy.
__label__neu	 She told me she should have listened to me and just used the kitchen sink w/ the sprayer. 
__label__neu	He uses it more to throw at things than to chew on.
__label__pos	A huge hit around here, highly recommend especially if you can find it for a reasonable price like we did.
__label__neg	 But the smell was noxious
__label__pos	It's lightweight, so carrying my sleeping infant in it to or from the car is easy.
__label__neu	I would test the bottle before giving it to baby
__label__neg	After buying ten packs(on top of the ones that came with the bottles) of the nipples for these bottles,  we gave up and used our Advent bottles that we didn't want to use
__label__pos	Any plastic shopping bag will work in this diaper pail. 
__label__pos	 However, I stopped using it after a couple of weeks and realized my son took the bottle just fine without the need to warm up the bottle
__label__neg	"""If you do buy it, good luck and I hope you have better luck than we did."""
__label__neg	Maybe its just me, but I think this pump is so overrated. 
__label__pos	Because it is so trim it makes it a great choice for diaper bags too.
__label__neu	However, as some reviewers pointed it does not adjust in the front, you have to mess with the metal buckles in the back. 
__label__pos	My son ABSOLUTELY LOVES this jumperoo.
__label__neg	"""You really have to push & pull hard to get it to move at all."""
__label__neg	If anything, this product is more of a toy than a barrier.
__label__pos	A little pricey for having to replace every three months,  but if this is all I have to replace it is well worth it
__label__neg	The tray sits up to high for baby! 
__label__pos	I use it on our Bugaboo Bee and its a perfect fit.
__label__neu	I have tried 4 other brands and these are the worst.
__label__neg	The only minor problem is the water goes through, but I put a big towel underneath it so it cathes the water. 
__label__neu	Does the kid really appreciate the duck and recognize it?
__label__neu	I bought this mirror because it was far larger than the adjustable suction-cup mirror I had on the rear windshield of my car. 
__label__neg	 The U-shape isn't especially comfortable to me. 
__label__pos	I can't wait to put baby in it.
__label__pos	It's worth it!
__label__neg	I would still find him with his head bobbed to the side and looking uncomfortable.
__label__pos	Avent bottles are one of the best out there.
__label__neu	However, after a couple of months, we moved our daughter into a bigger tub so that she could kick her feet & move around more. 
__label__neg	You only get one 8oz bottle.
__label__pos	Enjoy!
__label__neg	"""When we returned it, my husband told the cashier at babies r us that Six Flags should buy the rights to this swing, and that it tried to kill our son."""
__label__neu	These cups are made of polycarbonate plastic,  which is a known toxic plastic,  especially unsafe in food/drink storage.
__label__pos	"""Even when he's fussy - I put him in this and he calms down."""
__label__neu	The nipples is big and hard(she was breastfed for the first three months and only took the bottle sometimes at first,  now she is on all bottles).
__label__neu	My daughter had silicone nipples that never tore and she has had teeth since she was 3 months old!
__label__neg	This was about the only option BRU had and it was a waste of money
__label__neu	Last night was the second of two 6-hour nights.
__label__neu	He is almost too big for it now, and we'll be looking at those bath seats.
__label__pos	The ONLY one our daughter (now two - she used it for about 3 months) and now our 2 month old son does not break out of is the Miracle Blanket.
__label__pos	The mesh fabric stays dry and cool even on the hottest days, there's plenty of leg room even in the rear-facing position, and this whole seat fits (albeit snuggly) in the backseat of my 2004 Saturn LW300 (a very small backseat!).  
__label__pos	"""We couldn't be happier."""
__label__neu	This swing goes side to side and front to back.
__label__neu	It's too soft in the middle and my baby boy was struggling while nursing.
__label__pos	Def a must have for little snackers
__label__pos	My son loooooves this - he could stare at it for hours and smile at it
__label__pos	I've tried a few different brands of pacifiers and these were hands down the best.
__label__neu	It fell apart,  and I pumped and pumped and I got less than 1/2 ounce.
__label__neu	I decided to try myself instead of taking it back to the fire company and I was able to install it.
__label__neu	Indeed these bring a little more breast into the cylinder which has resulted in slightly more milk being expressed.
__label__neu	Stylish but big
__label__neg	 They leak
__label__pos	That said,  I still use the seat I just won't be able to use it for as long as I would have liked.
__label__neg	I dread when it needs batteries though given what a hassle it is to remove from the crib rail!
__label__pos	When we first plugged it in it worked ok
__label__neu	We attached him onto her carseat so  she can play with him while we travel.
__label__pos	"""she rarely slept in her old carseat, but in this one she always falls asleep, and it looks so comfortable too (soft, padded and with armrest)."""
__label__neu	I attempted to use this bottle warmer with Born Free bottles...
__label__neu	Overall a good product, I just think it should be a little bigger.
__label__neu	I bought these after we moved because our new house had knobs on the front instead of on the counter surface
__label__pos	These covers were the only ones that I could find that would fit my changing pad (LA Baby 4-sided changing pad)
__label__neu	Worthless!
__label__neg	I'll keep trying because this product seems like a great idea and it was not cheap, but perhaps it's just a little too much work for a newer baby.If this company or any other consumer, has any ideas on how to improve my situation with this sling,I would love to hear from them.
__label__neu	Just a tip!!
__label__pos	"We use a new washcloth at each bathing so this is really all we need to hold.What I liked most about this product was that it ""grows"" with your child so they can use it as a stepstool as they get older."
__label__neu	It also came with the base for the car and seatbelt hookup.
__label__neu	I also use on on the floor under her activity gym (Sparkling Symphony Gym)since it doesn't include a mat.
__label__neu	This bottle is so effective that on the occasions he has used different bottles, he didn't know to let go to let air fill up the bottom of the bottle. 
__label__neg	The product doesn't work well on straight knobs that don't have anything to hang on to.
__label__pos	I like it that much.
__label__neg	"I am 5'8"" and it just does not work well"
__label__neg	 It doesn't leave much room for an infant once you secure the car seat to the stroller
__label__pos	It is a terry like covering that fits perfectly over the top of Baby Bjorn.
__label__neu	My pantry was a mess before I got this.It was a little tricky at first to put it together (the instructions don't specify that you should twist the shelves to lock into place).
__label__pos	"""The seat is very cuddly and washing the cover is a breeze."""
__label__neu	I bought this because my daughter has hated the pack n play from day one.
__label__pos	The food fits from the freezer trays right into this dish, so every night I popped them out of the trays and into the travel dish and put them in the refrigerator.
__label__neu	I took our toy apart and lined the spinners with felt so they would not wobble which was creating a noise even without the balls on them.
__label__neg	So I bought these to try and she hated them. 
__label__neg	I can't believe all the great reviews. 
__label__neu	"""Ack."""
__label__neg	The switch will not work most of the time on the a/c power and I can only get the light to turn on under the battery setting side. 
__label__neu	The pillow is now even more important to me as my belly needs support as I turn from one side to the other; I lift the side I am moving to up to the belly and finally down to rest.
__label__neu	Hes almost 8 months now and we had to sell his fisher price swing when he was 6 months cause he was just too big for it.
__label__pos	This bag is functional, stylish, and easy to carry.  
__label__neu	 I was having difficulty getting comfortable and sleeping at night so I decided to try the Snoogle
__label__pos	The handles are soft and long enough even for tall people. 
__label__neg	STAY AWAY FROM THE DIAPER GENIE.
__label__neg	You are much better off just getting a simple boom box that play's cd's
__label__pos	Some of the toys rattle, and the bright primary colors easily attract a baby's attention.
__label__pos	He was fortunately big enough to be carried around it in from day 1 but your child must be 21 inches to start using it.
__label__pos	It's much better with older babies (when they can hold their head up at least) and I really prefer the Active Carrier (with the lumbar back support) as I'm petite & this carrier does not have the support,  so it would always hurt my back after awhile.
__label__neg	What a blow to the postpartum ego.
__label__pos	They are quality plastic and last a long time.
__label__neu	I had to redo the strap & secure it
__label__neu	We prefered a basic blanket
__label__pos	"""Lots of different colors and textures."""
__label__pos	My daughter fell out the right leg side,  and hit the floor.
__label__neg	It takes a while to get it on, wrapped, and cinched where its comfortable, so slinging it on and off is not only not an option, you tend to dread the idea.Another point I will add is I used this right after having my baby, so I still had that 6 month pregnant-looking belly.
__label__pos	It's entertaining for our daughter, inexpensive, and well made.  
__label__neu	Also,  I'm a short person (barely over 5 feet tall
__label__pos	Our son's room smells clean with no poopy odors, and we save money by using our own tall kitchen bags.
__label__neg	You cannot let go of the baby for one second beacause they will slide
__label__pos	My son loves this carrier.  
__label__pos	"""I wasn't good about keeping it updated, but it's a great keepsake if you do."""
__label__neu	We started using the regular trash can and emptied it nightly until we got the diaper champ.
__label__neg	Some don't fit the crib mattress correctly and the kids are able to pull them off in no time (2 year old)... 
__label__pos	Perfect for little ones
__label__pos	The bear is quite cute and the white provides a nice contrast for easy eye focus  my little one will track it with his eyes whenever I hold it in front of him.The head crinkles quite nicely.
__label__neg	A day or so after my daughter's birth, one of my nipples became cracked, which caused a lot of pain every time I tried to nurse on that side.
__label__neg	Niether of my boys liked these bottles/nipples.
__label__neu	We have hardwood floors and we bought some foam mats to put under,  and it just slides all the time.
__label__neu	We have tried the Swaddle Me, the Swaddle Blanket, and the Miracle Blanket.
__label__neu	My son is 20 months old and we got these cups well over a year ago.
__label__neg	I also noticed that the wipes at the top were a bit dried out and soapy feeling. 
__label__neu	Because this car seat perches on top of a base,  you must fill in the gap between the base and seatback with either a rolled-up towel,  which shifts,  or a waternoodle,  which gets squished down over time.
__label__neu	I'd like to start by saying that this is not a stroller for young babies. 
__label__neg	 Also, once they did start to come off, I noticed it was leaving that sticky residue behind on my coffee table
__label__neg	 Okay, it doesn't gush, but it definitely drips enough and to me, dripping milk or even water all over the house is not okay. 
__label__pos	Now my son is about to turn one and his size four diapers are a perfect fit,  we still use this item every day
__label__neu	My 2 year old daughter is still not able to keep blankets on herself while she sleeps
__label__neg	"""My husband named it ""Leroy"" because it often was like having a 3rd person in the bed . . ."""
__label__neg	Then we tried the blue swivel seat, The whole thing flipped over with her in it and our tub was not textured, all she was doing was kicking her feet.
__label__pos	The sound difference is amazing.
__label__neu	It doesn't happen very often,  but when it does,  I just change to the other channel and the problem goes away
__label__neg	Furthermore, this thing is really a gimmick
__label__pos	This chair is a lifesaver!
__label__neu	Generally I turned the little bag part inside out and put them in the top rack of my dishwasher.
__label__neu	Audio does this nicely.
__label__pos	My daughter loves this gym!
__label__neg	"""And it really squishes up the back of her diaper because all her weight is pressing down right there - ew!"""
__label__neu	However the handle broke on it just 2 weeks ago.
__label__neg	much to my horror he was hanging sideways out of the swing! 
__label__neu	One time use then you have to pull out a pot and boil the thing,  then lay it to cool
__label__neu	My son would just pull these off the table.
__label__neu	Also,  I tried both the Playtex bags and Wal-mart brand.
__label__neg	 don't let it fool you, the sides and back are cheap particle board
__label__pos	"""After doing extensive research I originally was going to buy a different model but I took my daughter to the store and she hated my 1st choice."""
__label__pos	I love this oven lock!  
__label__neg	Second, it's a long blanket that wraps--there are no closures (velcro, snaps, etc), so he tends to slip down into the blanket, and the arm flaps bunch up in his armpits (uncomfortable).
__label__neu	Just make sure when you're installing it backwards to keep the level line horizontal and it will help you install easier; if the line's not level the seat will be moving around way too much.
__label__neg	I guess I am just not a fan of ring slings
__label__pos	I wish I had had this car seat 12 years ago for my oldest son!  
__label__pos	"""We got the Healthy Care Booster Seat after both of my sisters-in-law told us how much they liked and used theirs."""
__label__neu	I do hand wash so I think they last longer than if washed in a dishwasher.
__label__neg	The insulating bag rips!
__label__neg	My Husband and I would awaken in the middle of the night to this wretched static noise
__label__pos	"""As long as you don't plan on using it as your nighttime ""mobile"" then it is awesome!"""
__label__neu	However, it doesn't seem to bother my husband as much.  
__label__neu	I got this as a shower gift.
__label__neg	However,   if you think you'd like to use this on an occasional overnight trip away from home,   forget it
__label__pos	My 4.5 month-old daughter LOVES her exersaucer!
__label__neg	 I almost considered buying another, but at $15 (that's with shipping) it's too much money for something that isn't going to last long
__label__neu	"""I bought one used from a coworker."""
__label__neu	If I could get down on the floor and bathe my son in the big tub with this tub inside it would probably be easier (but I don't think my knees would appreciate it.
__label__pos	"""Like other reviewers, I agree that it is extremely easy to clean - just wipe the main chair with a cloth, and the tray is just 2 pieces which are also easy to wipe, or wash in the sink."""
__label__neu	You also don't have to worry about water dripping off the liner and getting on baby because of the plastic they are made of, the water does not stick to the liner.
__label__pos	It doesn't need the gentle treatment of it's more expensive silk cousins so it can handle spit- up diaper explosions. and be passed around the neighborhood.
__label__neu	Purchased two in case one got lost. 
__label__pos	It's got great colors and shapes and overall is just terrific.  
__label__neg	My son won't suck for more than a few minutes. 
__label__neu	Plus, my own cousin said it hurt her daughter as well....
__label__neg	I suppose it does offer a tiny bit of resistance, but I'd say it is maybe 10% less likely to be thrown on the floor than any other lightweight plastic plate. 
__label__neu	It was akward to put on and I couldnt see over it!
__label__neu	Even though she has been able to sit by herself for quite some time now, it's reassuring to know that her back is well supported, and there is still enough room for her to play in the water.
__label__neg	Furthermore, our DVD player is on a small shelf and we cannot remove the guard without removing the DVD player from the shelf first.
__label__neg	 After a while though, it began drying out too quickly and literally burning the wipes on the bottom
__label__pos	 Height adjust is super easy, especially in New England weather
__label__pos	"""Highly recommended!"""
__label__pos	Fits 20-100lbs so you wont have to purchase another seat after this one!
__label__neg	"""The baby cannot enjoy the adorable face."""
__label__pos	It takes AA that only with last 4 hours.
__label__pos	I really like this monitor. 
__label__neu	The music will drive you crazy after awhile so thank goodness for volume control!
__label__neg	Maybe these bags work for supermoms,  but they didn't work well for busy,  sloppy me
__label__neg	But then the collars and nipples were really too big to work with this rack.
__label__neu	The less expense models (even the Wal-Mart brand) will.
__label__neg	 My daughter does like the music but it doesn't play long enough and it is irritating to have to continue to activate (she isn't able to)
__label__pos	I hate changing fitted sheets and the zipper makes this a complete breeze.
__label__neu	I had recieved this as a promotional item at Babiesrus so I didn't have to pay anything for it
__label__neg	&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;BUT if you still decide to get this, check it in the store first, because when I got mine home it was USED- it had obvisiously been returned (someone else thought it was useless too I guess) with milk residue on the bottles- yuck
__label__neu	"""I had trouble with my first monitor which was the Summer Video Monitor."""
__label__pos	"""I recommend the medela nipple shield, I used it for latch on problems and immediately my son nurses just fine, its for temporary use but I have been using it non stop sense my son was born.."""
__label__pos	I like the hook on the top so it's easy to hang up to air dry over the shower head. 
__label__neu	Brown's
__label__pos	It worked great for us to wheel around our toddler in the airport,  easy to take apart during the security search,  and great to carry around in your purse/diaper bag until landing where you'll have to do it all over again until you get to the car
__label__pos	"""Fits very snug on my table and nicely padded."""
__label__neg	 We have received other taggies products (soft books and a board book) and she does not play with them either
__label__pos	The reading was very quick and easy to read.
__label__neu	But really,  each button plays exactly the same notes except with a different instrument.
__label__neg	 On top of all of that, you can't purchase covers for it, so I was stuck trying to deal with a standard pillow case cover over the top which just got tangled and fell off every night
__label__neu	Interesting that the description for the product reads for one-year olds,  but there is a warning for choking hazards on the Amazon page,  stating not for children under three.
__label__pos	I love the tempurature feature, we heat with a pellet stove and it makes it easy for me to monitor at night that the kids rooms are warm enough.
__label__pos	I would recommend it to anyone.
__label__pos	We do notice less burping when using these as compared to others.
__label__neg	First,  I am small framed and the sling kept sliding down so the ring was too low
__label__pos	"""This is our third one and I couldnt be happier."""
__label__pos	I could think of a few improvements like the ability to pump into storage bags, etc, however, for the price and quality I give it 5 bright stars.
__label__pos	It's in the right places and with the right amount of it too!
__label__neu	It has the slit-type hole,  and the baby has to be squeezing the very tip if anything's going to come out
__label__neg	 my child just thought it was a game to try to get the snacks out of the cup
__label__neg	I bought 4 of these bottles for my son I tried a couple of different bottles for my son
__label__pos	This is portable and light.
__label__pos	I love this pitcher so much that I bought two.  
__label__neg	The straps hang on my a tiny hole,  and at the right angle can be pulled out,  which I find dangerous for baby
__label__pos	"""I thought cleaning them was no more difficult than any other bottles..."""
__label__pos	"""I didn't want her to swallow it or inhale it so I sent it back."""
__label__pos	"""The only thing I would change is the travel discs that are inserted so there's no leakage, either make the cap seal off the nipple, or put a little handle on the disc, they can get stuck up in the cap sometimes."""
__label__pos	The first 5 minutes she is in it she just stares at everything there is to do in amazement.
__label__neu	I also don't recommend buying many 4oz bottles, my son drank less than four ounces for only about 6 weeks and he was up to 5 ounces, and it is a pain to have to fix two bottles.
__label__neu	The first time I used it came apart during use.
__label__pos	"""I was really excited about getting this swing for my baby shower."""
__label__neu	I received this shade for free when I bought other products from Babies R US.
__label__neu	I jumped out of bed and was ready to run into the baby's room when I heard the guy talking to a girl in what appeared to be a cell phone conversation from who knows where. 
__label__neg	The only draw back is they do have a lot of pieces with six parts as compared to most bottles four.  
__label__neu	I am VERY disappointed with this product.
__label__pos	What a terrific invention!
__label__neu	Uses much less water and energy than running the dishwasher
__label__neu	I was a die-hard Avent user. 
__label__pos	"""I strap this onto the handle & she calms down immediately!"""
__label__pos	"""I read a lot of the other reviews and read how other buyers complained about the straps but really, there aren't that many and it's super easy to adjust."""
__label__neg	SAVE YOUR MONEY -- DON'T BUY THIS ITEM
__label__pos	The nipple never had a chance to heal because I was breastfeeding every few hours.
__label__pos	Altogether this swing has no drawbacks or fine print.
__label__neg	 Once we got the hang of it, we realized it's pretty useless. 
__label__neg	 I agree that the canopy does absolutely nothing to shield infants from the sun
__label__neg	These pads are definitely due for some revamping.
__label__pos	It is pleasant sounding and the button is easy to press and the handle makes it easy for my one year old to grip
__label__neu	I can fit one diaper and the wipe case and changing pad, but I need more than one diaper in it. 
__label__neu	Put 7 oz of water and pop it in the microwave for 4 minutes and your done! 
__label__pos	Maybe because the carpeting in our apartment stabalizes it, but it's perfect.
__label__pos	love it!
__label__pos	"""This is a great monitor, don't be fooled because it is cheap that it isn't good."""
__label__pos	The adjustable- length strap makes it a breeze to navigate all sorts of needs in terms of anchor points.4)  Doesn't take off the paint!
__label__pos	Definitely worth the money.
__label__neg	For the price there are MUCH better toys out there!
__label__neg	This product definitely does not follow modern technology. 
__label__pos	But it is great in that I can keep the kids away from the spout and the kids are able to clean up their own toys and it gives me storage for their bath products.  
__label__neu	Meanwhile,  my baby is screaming because he's hungry and wants that bottle!! The microwave only takes 30 seconds and it's the same temperature EVERY time.
__label__neu	The nipples with the correct Collar will fit * ANY* Medila bottle.
__label__neg	 You can only fit 4 bottles in there at a time
__label__neg	"""I think it could use something to make it slip a little less."""
__label__pos	I would tell others to get this booster, over others that are not as nice or entertaining, overall a great value, worth every penny.
__label__neg	The outer nipple is designed to feel like a breast, but when my 3 month old gets it into her mouth it collapses onto itself, then the suction from trying to drink from it and the milk gathered in the nipple seem to create some kind of vacuum and make it hard for her to drink. 
__label__pos	The bottles are great because you can easily pour them into the liners.
__label__pos	The best aspect, however, is that the nipples do not fall out when the compartment is opened.
__label__neg	 The way that it is angled, you need to mount it on the wall above the crib, or have it sitting on a tall piece of funiture that can overlook the crib
__label__neg	I love this bottle brush, because it is so convenient to have the two brushes in one, and unlike the Munchkin bottle brush it doesn't swivel (the swiveling makes it impossible to get the brush on the sides of the bottle, pump horns, etc) but this brush broke after only 8 weeks of use
__label__neu	meaning we ALL sleep better! 
__label__pos	That's what the exersaucer made for both of my sons.
__label__neg	These are more expensive than buying the Medela or other brand storage bags - but those bags are such a pain IMO.
__label__neu	Even before we had our baby I told my wife that I wanted this baby carrier as my first Father's Day gift. 
__label__pos	Everyone says that all car seats are the same I think this one is worth the extra money.
__label__neu	Quick cleanup, quick fill up.  
__label__neu	I used it every night from the day I got it to the a week or so after I delivered.
__label__neu	 Didn't really see the need for this-a much better buy that my mother insisted on was the harness pillow for support.
__label__pos	I was thrilled to find that Amazon had these glass ones in stock.
__label__neg	not only when the baby is sucking on it,  but afterwards,  trying to clean it is a nightmare
__label__pos	He just really can relax in it
__label__pos	this is just SO EASY snap,  snap,  snap and you're done
__label__neu	This was fine for the first couple weeks, then I realized that it actually didn't do much help.  
__label__neu	I got this pump,  because my electric one was a little noisy and I didn't like waking up my daughter in the middle of the night
__label__pos	We've had this for a few months now and am very pleased with this purchase
__label__pos	"""The Podee has been a lifesaver for us."""
__label__neg	I usually use them for nighttimes with my baby anyway,  so I don't mind the bulk of the full sized insert.
__label__neg	I decided to pump but when my baby was fussy I couldn't pump every 3-4 hours like I needed to so my supply dropped.
__label__neg	I think not. 
__label__neu	lid,  bottle,  outside straw,  middle straw,  and bottom straw
__label__neu	When I washed this item,  it ended up being deformed.
__label__pos	I really love my diaper genie it holds about one week of diapers with no smell.
__label__pos	It's winter now,  and I was worried that as it got warmer,  it would make me and my husband too hot.
__label__pos	"""This potty rocks!"""
__label__neu	Avent bottles have more BPA than any other leading brand.
__label__neg	 You can't put a bedding change in it with anything else in there, it just doesn't have enough room and the frame is very cheaply made I was afraid it would break. 
__label__pos	I like the terry cloth on the inside.
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	Before we could leave the music on continuously and he would watch contently for as long as we needed.
__label__neu	"""Of course, he's strapped into it for obvious safety reasons."""
__label__neg	The only change I would make would be an smaller attachment system.
__label__pos	We highly recommend this to all moms and dads' cars as well as grandmas and grandpas too!
__label__pos	I really liked the idea of this.
__label__neg	 BUY THE DIAPER CHAMP
__label__neg	 Well this is the only good feature. 
__label__pos	These were a huge help getting started on my first baby.
__label__neu	I took the Busy Zoo away,  of course.
__label__neu	This product does not adhere well.
__label__neu	"""I am all about ease of clean, and this cover while very easy to clean it is not optimal to place it in the drier (even on low)."""
__label__neg	Blankets don't work well, and are constantly slipping, plus you can't see the baby very easily.This nursing cover fixes all those problems.
__label__neu	These bottles were a gift at our baby shower
__label__neg	This thing is cheap and flimsy. 
__label__pos	Great Color and Great Set
__label__pos	My daughter received it as a gift when she was 1,  and she and my nephew would constantly fight to play with it.
__label__pos	Getting a fresh bag is quick and easy to do.  
__label__neu	Looks like the thread used to seal the strap into the base broke free
__label__neg	*  NO VELCRO - The velcro on the Swaddle Me kept waking our daughter up!
__label__neg	Doesn't come with a case which is $20 and all in all I think just knowing I am sleeping on a $40 pillow makes me uncomfortable!  
__label__neg	Also when you twist the lid open or closed,  it is hard to get a good grip because the gripping area is very thin
__label__neu	Once they're a little bigger you can do away with the hammock and they get to submerge a little more in the water while still sitting up.
__label__neu	 So my husband foud this Snuggle Nest & bought it
__label__pos	I love the pocket to hold burp rags (or TV remotes
__label__pos	The Sony 27 channel monitor worked perfectly!
__label__pos	It would be perfect for bedtime TV watching too.
__label__pos	I also appreciate how easy it is to clean with no nooks and crevices to get food permanently stuck in.
__label__pos	However once there he is as happy as can be.
__label__pos	Lots of extra folders for additional items.
__label__neu	There are just so many parts!
__label__pos	I also appreciate the two tiers and it doesn't take up too much room on the counter.  
__label__neu	They catch EVERYTHING that drops---applesauce to bread crumbs. 
__label__neg	We got this as a second hoping to use it upstairs at night.
__label__pos	This one keeps her very warm in the colder weather over her terry sleeper.
__label__neg	It's a good size, but poor quality, someone didn't think the design through
__label__neu	ERRR
__label__pos	If nothing else makes her happy her swing will.  
__label__neg	 I don't know about you, but with the amount of stuff I have in the diaper bag, the last thing I need is this thing weighing me down
__label__neg	Especially if we are out for a big event and the boys are dressed nicely.
__label__neg	The miracle middle is nothing special, so if you are a plus size mom on the larger side of plus, don't buy this thinking the pillow will stretch and wrap around you
__label__pos	"""Don't spend the extra money, buy this one and save."""
__label__pos	It's durable and educational.
__label__neu	Can't they make the cheap one and a higher end sheet for those who don't mind spending money for better quality
__label__pos	She loved this toy for many months (until she learned to crawl).
__label__pos	my son is almost 7 months and we're still using it (although with supervision)this is NOT like a regular nursing boppy,  it's a big pillow that nestles your babywhy i love it
__label__pos	It's brightly colored and easy to assemble.
__label__neg	 I got the Kiddipotamus CozyUp Black/Red or BLue/Ivory Kiddopotamus CozyUp Carrier Covers instead because it goes over the top of the car seat only and it worked really well
__label__pos	They need to improve this tub.
__label__neg	 Brown's bottles (8-9 oz size) to be very cumbersome, especially when storing them in the fridge or in a diaper bag
__label__neu	"""The changing table is a nice reddish oak, while the crib was very blonde."""
__label__neu	I got this because I knew eventually I'd have to warm bottles even though I am breastfeeding.
__label__pos	This is one of only a few products my husband and I would buy again with no hesitation.
__label__pos	"""I love that she is non toxic, no BPA or other bad chemicals."""
__label__neu	I wasn't expecting much, but it was something for the time being, till I could find something I felt would be sturdier. 
__label__pos	"""I love the fact that you can play music, water sounds, and wave sounds."""
__label__pos	Mom and dad can use it (we actually bought it for grandma who loves to bathe our daughter but has an ackward time doing it in our tub) and then our daughter can use it to brush her teeth or to stand in the kitchen.The maximum weight on this product is 200 pounds so I think its a good product for adults as well who maybe need a little extra help reaching that top shelf in the kitchen!
__label__pos	The lights with the little moving butterflies mesmerize my daughter.
__label__neg	I was walking in the mall one afternoon and 2 screws just fell off
__label__neg	"""I used it more as a place to set him while I did a quick chore or two around the house."""
__label__neg	I don't have a dishwasher, so I have to hand wash each piece.
__label__pos	It is absolutely perfect!  
__label__neu	3. Double nipple system means double washing (which we expected going into it).
__label__neu	It sounds like it's french or maybe spanish
__label__neg	We figured it was just because the tile was old.
__label__neu	It's unstable,  has a sharp edge which cuts into the baby's bottom -- I can't understand how anyone would be expected to sit on this... especially a potty-training child?
__label__neu	Very noisy.
__label__pos	This mattress pad is waterproof.
__label__neg	 I have two and they both looked old, faded and worn after the first wash
__label__neu	We've had ours for several years.
__label__pos	A comfy baby is a happy baby- a happy baby is a happy parent! =)
__label__neg	I only use these bottle with my pump and even then they are a pain in the butt,  because they don't want to stay screwed to the pump
__label__neg	I bought this, put it on the crib, took one look at it, took it off, and returned it.
__label__pos	This is a quality rack that holds a lot, fits in a small space, and rotates for easy access.
__label__neu	Two weeks after receiving the gym I opened it, put batteries in the musical star, and arranged all the  toys on the bar according to the directions.
__label__neg	What I am disappointed with is the durability
__label__neu	I like it a lot, but its cumbersome to put on
__label__pos	It's light weight and super easy to attach.
__label__neu	Once he was about 4-5 weeks old, we switched to using the 'motion' mode, meaning he had to hit or kick the toys or bars to get the music and lights to play. 
__label__pos	Haven't had any issues with the pre-printed labels on the bottles though.
__label__pos	I love our wipe warmer!
__label__pos	So every time we wanted him to do the dirty deed, we just put him there and almost invariably he would move his bowels as he played with the toys or sucked on his fingers.  
__label__pos	It's the only way she like to travel.
__label__neu	I've read that baby overheating can lead to SIDS.  
__label__neu	And regardless of brand ANY diaper pail still needs to be emptied on a regular basis.
__label__pos	My baby boy is just beginning to understand cause and effect and this seems to help a little (crinkle the head, make a sound, get a smile.
__label__neg	BUT,  it DOES NOT hold what it says it does
__label__neg	I think this is a waste of money
__label__neu	 (They're like 4x4 now!)
__label__pos	I love it already...
__label__neu	It will support baby on a slight incline and will keep her from rolling off either side or down. 
__label__neg	I also found that I did not like these bottles for feeding because they do nothing to prevent air from entering baby's belly and the result is gas or worse, colic. 
__label__neg	The nail clippers are too difficult to see what you are doing and so I end up cutting my daughter's fingers - the nail scissors are too dull to cut her nails
__label__neg	 Then just today, April 25, 07 the motor conked out AGAIN
__label__neu	When my hand-me-down Diaper Genie broke,  I bought a Diaper Champ.
__label__pos	My newborn loved the napper, and we removed it at about 5 weeks to allow him to sleep on the flat surface of the bassinet insert.
__label__neg	 I ended up tossing it. 
__label__pos	I can't imagine going through winter without it.
__label__neg	Whenever I used these, I kept having to stop my son from eating to make sure he was not just sucking air. 
__label__neu	Maybe I just picked up a bad one.
__label__neu	remote didnt work and the music was grainy
__label__pos	It is very durable and washes well, which comes in handy for spit up and diaper leaks.
__label__neu	I think I'm going to get the Diaper Champ to keep downstairs where we do the majority of our changes and keep the Genie in the nursery
__label__neu	to the grandparents' house.
__label__pos	And I love that you can play the music or sounds without having the swing turned on.
__label__pos	He loves them!
__label__neu	We originally purchased the yard to wrap around our stone wall/fireplace. 
__label__pos	This was our life saver for our sons first 9 months.
__label__neu	i have 2yo twins who love using chopsticks but as a wohm i don't have the time to endlessly wrap rubber bands around disposable chopsticks to help them.
__label__pos	I still use them because I have them, and they do serve their purpose
__label__neg	Our baby's umbilical cord stump fell of when she was just a few days old, so we bathed her in this tub.
__label__neu	Two stars.
__label__neg	 Caution to those
__label__neu	The two-piece design is terrific for trapping urine in the little grooves and also the cushy ring often slips off when this is hung up in the bathroom since you have to hang it by one of the little handles
__label__pos	I wanted this breastpump because I am a huge Avent customer
__label__pos	But it was an amazing asset for us for months, so I'd still consider buying it again...
__label__pos	 But does do the job. 
__label__neg	I got so aggravated, I just gave up and kept the mobile off.
__label__pos	My son LOVES it still and I wouldn't replace this purchase for anything.
__label__pos	Enjoy!
__label__neu	I use it in the bottom of the bathtub
__label__pos	Higher than all Maclarens, more stable than other umbrella strollers plus it reclines automaticly without belt udjustments. 
__label__pos	go with a Diaper Champ
__label__pos	The quaker on the duck's bill still wokrs and it has a handy suction cup so we stick it to the back of the tub wall when done.
__label__neu	My newest technique is simply to use tap water already at my baby's favorite temperature and put it in a thermos.
__label__pos	I love that you can change swinging directions.
__label__neg	The purpose of a baby monitor is to free you up for household chores while still allowing you to know that junior is safe and sound
__label__neu	"""My suggestion, don't put it in the drier and it stays perfect (learned with the 2nd one we bought)."""
__label__neg	Not really.
__label__pos	"""It is big, soft, cushiony, and looks nice."""
__label__pos	 When my husband and I saw this product at a local toy store we could not wait to buy it and watch her with it
__label__neu	The concept of this pitcher is to keep the mixing blades below the surface of the liquid to keep air to a minimum.
__label__neu	Although you can breastfeed in it I think it is easier to remove the baby from the sling before nursing (but i have to admit that I feel the same way about the Bjorn and also feel pretty comfortable nursing in public).
__label__neg	I received this as a gift and didn't check the reviews before using I should have.
__label__pos	They also fit right into Avent bottle warmer, which we also have.
__label__pos	I bought this mobile for our little girl to hang over her changing table.
__label__pos	Baby has enjoyed this consistently from age 2mo. to 6mo. 
__label__neu	In order to get it to close,  we had to scoot her down and then fold over the extra fabric at the neck.
__label__pos	"""It rolls up easily and neatly for travel."""
__label__neu	While these are thin they definitely are * not* the same as using tissue.
__label__neu	 Once we finish bathing her, we slide the entire unit forward just enough so that the drain hangs over the edge of the sink and let the water drain
__label__pos	"""I went on reviews when I bought this and it is so easy to use, better than any plastic tub out there."""
__label__neg	This brings me to another point: I only uncovered the #7 sign when I was poking around wondering why my pump had lost suction after only a few months of occasional use (several other reviews here noted the same thing)
__label__neu	3
__label__neu	The only complaint that i have is that the shelves are basically hard cardboard, but dont let that discourage you b/c they really are sturdy and as i mentioned i've got baskets on the shelves so you really dont notice.
__label__neu	I bought this because I was worried about waxy things on the diaper.
__label__pos	"""Great for 4oz to 11oz bottles."""
__label__neu	"""I get a brown residue on the bottom, but I attribute that to the water quality, because I get it on my steam sterlizer, which is a different brand."""
__label__pos	This adorable little turtle (so cute my kids fought over it) does not keep an accurate temperature
__label__pos	The best part is that at the end of the day you can just toss the whole thing in the dishwasher.  
__label__neg	But by then they want to move-on to something they can sit-up in anyway.
__label__neu	Not only did it not help the reflux,  but I don't feel it was safe and it didn't hold up in the washing machine.
__label__neu	"""These locks took some time to install, however when you follow the instructions it goes very smoothly."""
__label__neg	Another issue we had was that the nipples all colapsed!
__label__pos	It fits any type of bottle.
__label__pos	"""I've never had a problem with Medela Pump & Save and would recommend these above all."""
__label__pos	It has a suction control which helps when I am sore and need a lower setting. 
__label__neg	They would nave even worked nicely as little toy baskets, but I will not use them. 
__label__pos	We can check to see his position (I am always nervous about him smooshing his face into the mattress when he rolls around) his breathing and the geographic locale of his pacifier!
__label__neu	And it doesn't hold a lot of diapers.
__label__pos	"""We love it."""
__label__neu	And I do wish they made handles to attach so it would be easier for my boys to learn to hold their bottles.These are still by far my boys favorite bottle.
__label__pos	i love the colors, its a unisex bag, whicj i like , so i can use it with next baby.
__label__pos	It was incredible how quickly she has developed since we bought ours a week ago.
__label__neu	My recommendation?
__label__neu	Up until my daughter was 2 months old, I used the infant insert that comes with the tub to hold her.  
__label__neg	 It's very cheap flimsy plastic
__label__neg	It is made of plastic and it does not seem at all durable.
__label__pos	It's ALL GOOD!
__label__pos	Then, when my daughter was about 8-months-old, I found a pack on super clearance.
__label__pos	"""Do yourself a favor and get these Playtex bottles to begin with."""
__label__neg	)- Really, really leaks!
__label__neu	This pump lasted a week before it lost its suction on me.
__label__neg	The caps leak frequently and waste the formula that should be ingested by my baby.
__label__neu	They also work as burp cloths for those using disposable diapers.
__label__neg	 I dont really know how well it warmes up as I haven't been able to use it
__label__neu	Another bag thing about these Medela bags are that they are more expensive than the others.
__label__pos	"""It looks beautiful with the rest of the baby furniture and was easy to put together."""
__label__neg	For me it's a hassle and barely fits in the basket in my stroller.
__label__neu	My husband and I picked out this diaper pail when I was pregnant with my son because friends told us to get one that uses regular garbage bags.
__label__neg	Now there are MANY better and much cheaper options.
__label__neg	"""If your baby is hungry they want to eat now and don't want to wait for a bottle to warm up in this thing."""
__label__neu	She's now 2,  fully pt,  but will still not go near it.
__label__neu	My daughter is 9 months old now and still uses this tub.  
__label__pos	Our baby started out with the Flutter & Chime bouncy chair (love this chair also) but at 3 months she started to pull her head up and I worried she would soon tip it over.
__label__pos	 Even Gerber's one-use disposable nipples are way better.
__label__neu	When my daughter was under 3 months old, it was a little bit big for her (her head flopped way back in a very uncomfortable position. 
__label__neg	Unfortunately, lots of formulas float and need a lot of agitation to mix properly.
__label__pos	"""The pump, while a bit nerve-wracking to first aseemble all the pieces, hoses and containers, was very easy to use."""
__label__neg	A little disappointed I forced open the first one only to find that it was all rusted out from water via hand washing
__label__neu	Some stars show on the wall and some on the ceiling.
__label__neg	The first time I threw it away after 2 uses, realizing that after all my efforts some food had stayed around the ring.
__label__neu	 We went through the whole container of bubble mix in less ten a week. 
__label__neg	 You would think the makers of this would know that every item that is going to touch a baby is going to be washed
__label__neu	One thing I liked about this mirror was the bright colors,  shapes and animals along the border.
__label__neu	I think they were trying to play twinkle twinkle little star but the notes were off in some areas.
__label__neg	 I do not know why Graco is still circulating car seats that has the extremely impractical and inconvenient model
__label__neu	These sheets are ridiculously expensive - especially considering how low the thread count feels on them.
__label__pos	"""She LOVES it."""
__label__neu	!
__label__neg	I BOUGHT THIS FOR TEN DOLLARS AND WHEN I INSTALLED IT,  I REALIZED THAT IF I JUST BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE CHEAP PLASTIC PICTURE FRAMES THAT STAND ON THEIR OWN,  IT WOULD DO THE SAME THING
__label__pos	Safe Safe Safe!
__label__neu	They also hold lots of goldfish!  
__label__pos	Plus side: The fence itself is robust and basically indestructable. 
__label__pos	He's only 4 days old and the insert is just perfect for his little body
__label__pos	It is without a doubt one of the best on the market currently.  
__label__pos	The seat is cushioned, the ride is smooth.
__label__neu	The concern with BPA seems to be heightened when the bottles are washed with hot water or sterilized at hot temperatures.
__label__neu	The tub doesn't really fit in either single or double sinks,  we've tried both.
__label__neu	 Oh well, I am online shopping for a replacement now. 
__label__neu	Snoogle's supportive secret is in its cover because when left without,  it's basically a flat blob of cheap batting that stores body heat like an extra-lumpy camel and then spits it back at you during the night.
__label__neg	I don't feel that this carrier is very safe and it's very difficult to get baby in and out.
__label__neu	The basin on these spoons is so shallow that you can hardly get any food on them.
__label__pos	This is such a great find. 
__label__neg	However, we began using these again with our second child
__label__neu	At least that doesn't break.
__label__pos	They really limit the gas intake and we never had an issue with leaking bottles, like so many other brands.
__label__neg	It is not convenient when you are out and about.  
__label__pos	Love It!!!
__label__neu	Jacques comes complete with a mirror, a squeaker, taggies, lots of textures and colors, and a link so he can tag along.
__label__neg	" I'm 5'4"" and about 125 pounds and it just kept slipping to the side and didn't hold still"
__label__pos	Anyhow, it is very convenient for at home use.  
__label__neu	Skip the swaddleme and get an Amazing Miracle Blanket.
__label__neg	One thing I will say about this, is that it's really heavy for a baby.  
__label__neg	 You might have better luck with it but it just didn't work for us
__label__pos	It keeps the area clear or clutter and we use it every couple of hours, so I can't complain.
__label__pos	But to be honest I didn't try any other type of a bottle since this one works so well.
__label__pos	Very Pleased!!
__label__neg	which is NOT what I wanted. 
__label__pos	"""I bought this way b4 my little one was born because I fell in love with the design and concept..."""
__label__pos	Once I got the hang of it, I found this pump to be lifechanging.
__label__neg	While we are still using it (my son is 6 months old but has the size of a one year old child) we had to remove the toy bar when he was about 3-4 months old since he managed to grab both ends end remove it himself almost injuring his eyes.
__label__neu	"""My girlfriend had her baby 11 days before me and she had purchased a different kind of tub."""
__label__pos	"""I still think it was a great buy!"""
__label__neg	It was a disaster (think screaming, cold, baby).
__label__neg	 Brown's was not the answer
__label__neu	I can't take off too many stars for my son's personal preference but just because a baby likes one natural nipple doesn't mean he will like another
__label__neu	The silicone is the wrong texture too - nothing like the real thing.If you really like the look of Avent and think you want to use them, buy just one bottle and nipple to start until you are sure they work.In my opinion, a much better starter system is the Playtex (I use the Drop-Ins) - it comes with several different nipple shapes to try, including latex, which has a more realistic texture.I foolishly bought the Avent starter set because someone somewhere told me that they were the most breastfeeder friendly and that companies that make bottles AND formula only want to sabatoge your brreastfeeding efforts - - what a silly and paranoid accusation that turned out to be!
__label__neg	Good seat but not for infants
__label__neg	the spring on this thing is so stiff that there's no way that my baby could make it jump
__label__neg	 I tried these and the Dr
__label__pos	I would definately recommend this product!
__label__pos	Babies deserve to be pampered &amp; this is an easy way to make sure the diaper changing experience is comfy!
__label__pos	"""Quality-wise, it is just about as good as my $600 custom made Dutalier glider that's in my daughter's nursery."""
__label__pos	It makes for an excellent baby shower gift.
__label__neu	So now we're stuck with it
__label__neu	This one was surprisingly one of the cheapest and also had all the features I was looking for. 
__label__neg	The new spouts are NOT like the old spouts, I just bought new cups and they don't let enough air into the cup, so the nipple inverts into the cup when the child is sucking liquid from it.
__label__pos	Now that he is older, he is really enjoying watching the leaves and birds rotate and watching himself in the relective mirror above.
__label__pos	I see you can get up to XL so I guess I will be using these for a while!
__label__neg	I found it to be an incredible nusance,  so I borrowed a friend's Medela electric pump
__label__neg	The sides of the ramp are hard and if they move there head to quickly they could hurt themselves
__label__neu	*there is a mp3 speaker/hookup though it is rather poor quality as far as sound goes* the large tires and pivot front wheel make for great steering* the width of the stroller is not a challenge.  
__label__pos	"""My 6 month old baby has been using this since he was only a few days old and there is no problem!"""
__label__pos	"""All in all a great product and i have and will continue to recomend it to anyone who will listen!!!"""
__label__neg	 So now we are stuck with 20 leaking bottles that require a sharpie every few weeks
__label__neg	"""It would be just as easy to put him in our full size bath tub."""
__label__pos	I give this a 5 start plus.My 6 month old Grandbaby was put in this playpen yesterday for his first time.
__label__pos	"""This carrier definitely is easy on the back and shoulders!!"""
__label__neu	The original arm's reach sheets are thin and rough...
__label__neu	However, there are times when I just feel like sitting down and not having to manually pump.
__label__neu	What a waste of money.
__label__pos	From just a couple of weeks old we used this toy to distract her if she was having a meltdown (of course she couldn't hold it then) and she still loves this toy!
__label__neu	I bought these because my daughter was a spitter. 
__label__pos	I bought this kit excited that I could use the adapter and just pump straight into the Playtex drop-ins.
__label__pos	The reception is so clear that I can hear my son breathing in his crib.  
__label__neg	I bought this thinking that it was the answer to my swaddling prayers
__label__neu	Our bed + mattress is pretty high and I needed the extensions to raise the cosleeper to my level.
__label__pos	I also found it more colorful and more to do then many other models.
__label__pos	I bought this for our infant son after reading the glowing reviews on this site.
__label__pos	She enjoys the soft music bubbles vibration and fish.
__label__neg	 And it still doesn't have anough suction to completly empty my breasts
__label__pos	perfect for nervous new parents!  
__label__neu	Overall, it the same toy with minor differences.  
__label__pos	It seems a little fast, but my daughter loved it.
__label__neg	Unfortunately it did not work in my very unusual doorway.
__label__neu	That's what you will end up doing anyway, I promise!
__label__pos	Ash used the reclining part until she was about 6 months old and able to sit pretty well straight up.
__label__pos	It always works fine with us!
__label__pos	I got this for my baby shower and I LOVE-Love-Love it.
__label__neu	 What she means is that her feet are tingling and going to sleep. 
__label__pos	"""Thanks Medela for once again, making an outstanding product..."""
__label__neu	 I had a manual Medella pump when my daughter was born and did not want to go manual again
__label__neg	You can't understand the spanish and quite frankly it is boring.  
__label__neg	 Who wants to buy that
__label__neu	They mix how ever much formula you need quickly and easily.  
__label__neu	I don't blame her.
__label__pos	"""baby would not nap without it for the first couple months."""
__label__pos	"""Peace of mind without breaking the bank is what this provides you."""
__label__neu	Also purchased an additional camera, so that I could monitor both of the children's rooms.
__label__neg	The main thing that annoys me and maybe this only happens with boys,  but it occasionally leaks underneath between the bowl and where it slides in
__label__neg	Ive hand and dishwashered it more than 20 times!
__label__neg	The button needed a lot of pressure to make it work and then it gets stuck.
__label__neu	Piece of junk.
__label__pos	"""And despite being so light, it's really sturdy."""
__label__neu	We have purchased the green with beige trim
__label__pos	I can also attest to it's duability since my three year old has tested it out on more than one occassion!
__label__neu	I only have one of the ties down so far.
__label__pos	I think this product should come in the box with the Baby Bjorn  it's essential!
__label__neu	is reduced
__label__pos	I love this car seat.
__label__pos	it takes half the time, which is very important when you have a baby to take care of.
__label__neu	The difference was astounding.
__label__neu	I love the durability of the design,  but I don't see how this bib could fit a baby for very long,  especially not one with any chub.
__label__pos	A great product!
__label__neg	If you want true clarity with this device you may have to keep it on battery or use a power filter in front of each plug.
__label__pos	We then decided to buy this tub because my little girl could be submerged in the water keeping her warm.
__label__neu	We've had these locks on both our toilets since the baby was just over a year old.
__label__neu	I throw them in the dishwasher or just rinse them off sometimes during the day. 
__label__neu	Read on
__label__neg	We had this cup sitting in the cup holder in his stroller and 5 minutes of movement from the stroller (at the zoo) caused it to leak out a puddle of milk into the cup holder.
__label__neg	The cotton is not pre-shrunk, so when you wash it the first time and it shrinks, the zipper ends up being too long, which causes the fabric to gather/bunch up.
__label__pos	"""Great Price too!!!"""
__label__neu	If you follow the instruction you can only fit 4 bottles, but I have been able to fit 5.
__label__neu	It's been so bad that we haven't used it yet.
__label__pos	These bottles definitely help to reduce colic.
__label__neu	"""The attempt was to get and keep the temperature just right and to serve as a cutsie-poo toy that might interest the baby."""
__label__pos	First, the pros to this seat:1. 
__label__pos	This is definitely one of our favorite purchases!
__label__neg	Poor quality to have it break 5 mins out of the box
__label__pos	"""These bottles are great but are very pricey."""
__label__neu	We have a Graco Snugride carseat and my 7 week old baby is 11 lbs
__label__neg	If you rely on that, it will take forever to drain.  
__label__neg	It does create pretty stars on the walls,  NOT on the ceiling.
__label__neu	How we made it work for us:Clothes pin that we just clip on over the sensor to turn the warmer on.
__label__pos	I like that I can also detach it from the plug and walk around with it on from room to room as it works on the backup battery - very helpful when your trying to get a quick shower.
__label__neu	I was also going to be returning to work and needed to pump for when I am gone.
__label__pos	My 2 month old loves to look at lights, although these lights are quite bright for a small toy.
__label__neu	While I always have my hands on her while she is in the tub it would be nice to have the sling make her more secure in the torso area so I could have more freedom to actually bathe her.
__label__neg	The cool tent feature makes the babies outgrow it so much more quickly than a regular open bouncy seat
__label__neg	I am having the hardest time installing the darned things.
__label__neu	"""We would have to push it by hand every so often to give the swing a slower pace."""
__label__neg	When the swing is folded flat the legs do not lock into place so they swing out as you are walking or trying to lay it flat in your car.
__label__pos	With the Ergo, nothing ever touches the ground so I knew I had to have one once the rainy season started to hit.  
__label__neu	"""So far, he's shown no interest in the toy aspect, but it has worked well with the temperature part."""
__label__neg	 Terribly
__label__pos	Easy to clean, dishwasher safe.
__label__neg	 I'd stay away from it
__label__neg	We have the same reviews as everyone else.
__label__pos	This mirror works when I thought it wouldn't.
__label__pos	Very pleased
__label__neg	This one is VERY difficult to put together and the screw don't work well with the metal frame
__label__neg	 Just my opinion though
__label__neg	Something in my diaper bag punctured the plastic liner and the formula got all over my brand new diaper bag.  
__label__neu	I bought this toy because we had something similar that I bought 8 years ago for my first child.
__label__neu	but that's about it
__label__pos	"""I really like the plastic pouch inside."""
__label__pos	I like this toy because my almost 6-month old son can easily grab and hold on to it.
__label__pos	I had to wash it recently for the first time b/c my son spit up all over it and it held up great in the wash.  
__label__neg	I just know this one needs to be redesigned. 
__label__neg	I'm not happy with it at all.
__label__pos	My son loves using the potty with this seat!
__label__pos	I was amazed how fast she learnt how to control her hands there.
__label__neu	I don't know about the projectile thing.
__label__neu	Save your money and find something else.
__label__pos	We just love Freddie and this is his only toy so far that if it was lost I would buy another really quick!
__label__neg	If you search Amazon.
__label__pos	We do get static when it's placed by a cell phone but if it's moved or the cell is,  it's fine
__label__neg	 I would not recommend this product to anyone
__label__neg	Yes you can use any bag for it but it doesn't hide the smell and the lid slams down on its own almost catching my fingers while I'm changing the bag.
__label__pos	"""This is a great carrier!"""
__label__pos	SO BEAUTIFUL!
__label__pos	"""As another reviewer pointed out, it doesn't look like cheap plastic."""
__label__pos	I bought this for our 8 month old and she likes it a lot.
__label__neg	) On top of that, this cover is too short for any of our spigots
__label__neu	Sure enough, I did and I did!
__label__neu	 I have read that it is not good for baby to be facing out (difficult or impossible for them to block out all of the stimulation, unable to see parent's face to help them interpret situations). 
__label__neu	If there weren't bubbles then a vacuum would develop behind the milk making it harder and harder to suck the milk out.
__label__pos	I do it,  b/c my daughter loves the lights
__label__neu	"Perhaps if they improve upon the actual tub design,  or make a better ""shower"" we could have the best of both worlds."
__label__neu	It is not that big of a deal unless you're doing a 2.30 am feeding and trying to fill the bottle up without being able to see the markings.
__label__pos	I've been using bag #2 for two kids for a year now and it's great.
__label__pos	I have to say I love this.
__label__neg	They also look very unflattering under clothing. 
__label__neg	I brought the car seat with the Bundle Me installed to my local fire department for inspection of proper installation.
__label__pos	"""So much so we bought two sets."""
__label__pos	We are grateful that Ergo came out with this new insert as we were hearing that their previous insert was not really working with newborns
__label__neu	So even though this has many Pro's I would recommend getting something else if you are wanting to have something to last more than a year w/out any problems. 
__label__neg	 I assume that they make it completely uncomfortable to help prevent SIDS (your baby might has well be laying on the floor because it is not padded very well at all). 
__label__pos	This is a wonderful gate when you have your hands full as I often do.
__label__neg	They just can't hold up to regular use.
__label__neg	 Hope this helps you decide
__label__pos	I love sleeping with this body pillow.
__label__neu	For one you can't use a bottle warmer (the water seeps up into bottle).
__label__neg	It's okay to use at night because it is thick and it prevents leaks especially around morning time.
__label__neg	If your baby does chew when teething I can see how it would be a winner, but it's not the magical teether it's made out to be. 
__label__pos	 I was even getting out 5-6oz of milk from each breast
__label__neg	I thought I was all prepared before she was born by having this thing to help out,  but it was more of a pain to try to use
__label__neg	Medela is a cool brand, i liked the cream for nipples by Medela and some other products but i am ready to throw this pump away in a dumpster.
__label__neu	 So I tried it again when he was 4 1/2 months
__label__pos	We discovered that Evenflo and Avent bottles work just as well and are cheaper.
__label__pos	Otherwise, highly recommended!
__label__neg	I tried this a few nights before it got ole' heave-ho!
__label__neu	Yup,  it leaks.
__label__neg	And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used.As she entered into toddlerhood we started having some bad diapers just becasue of her cutting teeth and diet changes.
__label__pos	She loves to stare at his bold colors.
__label__pos	you can't go wrong with this toy!
__label__neg	and even putting them in 1/3 doesn't help. 
__label__neg	NOT for tall parents!
__label__pos	It's very easy to collapse and set up with one hand.
__label__pos	It hardly seems like they are wearing a cloth diaper!
__label__neg	These were terrible
__label__pos	I highly recommend it to everyone with a toddler.
__label__neg	This pump is terrible
__label__pos	I have taken many good pictures of my little one as a baby, held her perfect.
__label__neu	I tend to take negative reviews with a grain of salt and was excited about this product
__label__pos	"""The mattress already has its plastic cover, I don't need yet more plastic!"""
__label__neg	As mentioned,  I didn't and wouldn't buy this again
__label__pos	It fits the chair very snugly, feels soft and nice, and looks classy.
__label__pos	This is one of the best I have come across so far.
__label__neu	I was not a big fan of these bottles and neither was my daughter.
__label__neg	 I recommend anything else that requires regular trash bags instead of expensive refills!! 
__label__neu	 They pull off very easily even though they were a perfect fit on the rail
__label__neg	Plus if it did this to me then what about when I am washing my child
__label__neu	I have tried both monitors and all the plugs in the house. 
__label__pos	"""My daughter has used this for 3 months and loves it, very easy for her to hold."""
__label__neu	It funny because now she talks to her feet.
__label__pos	so they can be used on a regular basis even after your child is no longer interested in playing with them.
__label__pos	This is the best umbrella stroller and the most comfortable from all others that I saw including Maclaren. 
__label__neg	 We couldn't return it, and couldn't repair it
__label__neg	I am returning it because it's too expensive for so many headaches
__label__neu	We have had minimal problems with static and the sound/picture quality is great - even the night vision feature!
__label__neu	I don't know if that actually works
__label__neu	You can use it in a tub or sink, but the other infant tub works best for me.
__label__neg	 My baby is now 4 months old and we have done fine without a product like this.
__label__neu	And that's just if you're in the next room
__label__neg	"""I don't believe this product is ment to withstand the test of time."""
__label__pos	Handy and easy to clean. 
__label__neu	We have debated about tossing this monitor altogether and replacing it with the FP because we've been so disappointed.
__label__neu	I have three
__label__neu	(my grandson likes to stand on it to peek out the window).
__label__neu	I would say try to buy at a store so you can take it for a test-run and see if your baby will tolerate it
__label__neg	Until then,  mine is getting returned
__label__neg	 In fact in really messy diaper and you'll most likely want to shift the bag down some
__label__pos	I bought this swing used and it has done the job so far
__label__neu	net
__label__neg	I'm a nursing mother and it killed me to watch my milk leaking from those bottles all the time.
__label__pos	I look forward to using this throughout the rest of the winter. 
__label__neu	After reviewing many online reviews for tubs, I chose this one for my registry.
__label__neg	 I wouldnt recommend this to ANYONE
__label__neu	I wish they would do one for cabinets!
__label__pos	Great Product!
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	I like that you can exchange the tips, and it comes with a handy fever reference guide
__label__pos	 The seat is very soft and padded well
__label__neu	I do prefer using bottles to store milk and have found the Mother's Milk Mate storage bottles to be a great cheap alternative for storage bottles
__label__pos	At nine months, she seems to have exhausted all of the activities provided, but it is a great place to put her when I jump into the shower because I know she is happy and safe!
__label__pos	This is THE best way to sterilize bottles, bottle pieces, pacifiers, and breastpump parts.
__label__pos	It's easy for him to hold and easy for me to clean. 
__label__neg	BASKET IS HARD TO GET TO & ITEM IS HARD TO UNFOLD SOMETIMES
__label__neg	 the drawers are really cheap balsa wood too
__label__pos	Playtex will never leave you scrubbing milk/juice stains out of your carpet- or your kids' clothes!
__label__neg	That is when I stopped using it.
__label__neg	Two drawbacks - the sunshade doesn't extend out very far, offering limited protection at best.
__label__pos	"Also, especially if it is a ""big boy"", like ours, having him on it makes it easier to hold him."
__label__neg	After reading reviews we bought this thinking it would be more economical, since you don't need the special bags
__label__pos	I would recommend to all
__label__neg	It's such a hassle to poor the milk from the flabby plastic bag into a bottle without spilling some and nearly impossible if you are stuck with your infant in one arm and need to do this one-handed
__label__pos	Also a great price!
__label__pos	I like this walker very much.
__label__pos	A must have for nursing moms
__label__neu	But the mesh is super thick and large.
__label__neu	This thing is going to be torn apart and put out with the trash.
__label__pos	I purchased this when my baby was one month old and wished I had it sooner.
__label__pos	THE BEST BOUNCER!
__label__pos	"""This is multifunctional..."""
__label__pos	I was very pleased w/ the pump I used while in the hospital and am looking very seriously at buying the Ameda Purely Yours breastpump (as low as $140 in online searches.)
__label__pos	It is much easier for those middle of the night diaper mishaps, to just go in and unsnap the top sheet and put baby back to bed.
__label__pos	"""6.  There is many different modes for interaction, unlike the KnP which only has 2 options."""
__label__pos	I am happy with it.
__label__neu	The worst thing about the bag is that they have leaked a few times that my caregiver was warming up the milk.
__label__neu	I've had this diaper pail for 3 years now, and it's been through 2 kids (both in diapers for 18 months of that!).
__label__neu	My son used this until he refused to sit in the basket anymore.
__label__pos	"""She's still in the bassinet, but in the middle of the night or just when she's cranky, I can put her in the crib, turn on the mobile, and she stops crying."""
__label__neu	It seems it worked for some wonderfully and not so great for others or not at all.  
__label__pos	I used it every day until he could sit unassisted.
__label__pos	I have a basket full of age appropriate toys for him but this is by far his favorite and very portable at that!
__label__neg	I can hardly do it without busting an eardrum.
__label__pos	The pump is easy to use, has a comfy grip, and small to carry around. 
__label__pos	you can toss it in the washer when it gets dirty.
__label__neg	 For our particular situation, Dr
__label__pos	i have yet to see even a tiny drip come from these. 
__label__neg	I got this as a gift at my baby shower ( bought from my baby registry)My 2 month old son seems to like the vibration feature.
__label__neu	I received this as a shower gift and have used it three times so far.
__label__neg	First I tried the original sticker-thing that came with it.
__label__pos	Fortunately, there's no need!
__label__neg	It is very hard to get the cover back on once you take it off
__label__neg	"""As with most tubs, this holds maybe a quart of water, which means, only babies bum is wet, how fun is that."""
__label__pos	It also comes with a nice sized changing pad.
__label__neu	I would pick her up, feed her and place her back to sleep without ever leaving my bed.
__label__neu	"""I found this blanket on a babycenter store and decided to purchase it from here because of the free shipping."""
__label__neu	The lotion is good smelling but you can't beat Johnsons and johnstons pink stuff also include a bottle of that and you will havev a very happy mom- to be!
__label__neu	I almost have to cut it up perfectly so it's snug and baby can get to it easier.
__label__neu	It isn't very useful to lull her to sleep but I use it to entertain her in the morning when I getting ready.
__label__neu	 I'm just more mindful not to get too close to anything on the side with my drink, and try to use only bottles with caps. 
__label__pos	My son loved this toy on his carrier. 
__label__neu	The nipples on the Platex are much softer and shorter.
__label__pos	This monitor is fine.
__label__neu	"I don't use the ""petal attachment"" as I found that I didn't need it.  "
__label__pos	this is probably good up until baby can sit up and move around on their own
__label__pos	I've always been scared to use a thermometer rectally but I wasn't nervous with this one at all.
__label__pos	It is large enough that all three of us can comforatbly lay on it.
__label__neg	The only issue I have is that it is hard for me to get the nipple into the collar without pulling the nipple through with my fingers and,  if you don't get the lid on just right,  it will leak
__label__neu	"""But like I said, we've only used it a handful of times."""
__label__pos	My baby really enjoys this and can stay in it for quite some time entertaining herself.
__label__neg	Then you are faced with the leaking problem
__label__neg	We don't even turn on the lights for our baby because they distract him
__label__neu	Buy the Diaper Champ instead.
__label__neu	We found this wasn't the best thing to use in the bath regularly.
__label__neg	 They also hold less liquid than the others
__label__pos	Great restraint!
__label__neg	Now we just use an ittby bitty garbage can that holds about 5 diapers and we empty it out every day that's the only way to keep the diaper smell out of the house.
__label__neu	She does not have a lot of hair.
__label__neg	 They don't sell just that one little piece so I had to buy the actual pump again as a part. 
__label__neg	"""The smell would leak out."""
__label__neu	(1) cleaner (2) adjustable size.
__label__neu	I own a ring sling, Moby, Babyhawk Mei Tai, and an Ergo.  
__label__neg	My guys ripped them off the sides of the tables the second we put them up. 
__label__pos	It installs like a dream and fits small babies very well.  
__label__neu	It was easy to set up and is very sturdy,  but it doesn't actually swing open.
__label__neu	I was so disappointed because my son really like the music, and especially pushing the beads back and fourth, and making them rattle. 
__label__pos	love it, light up automatically in water, react quickly to a change of temp and alert you by a little bip if water is to low or high.
__label__neu	I really liked the blanket that is shown in the customer photos, but the blanket does not come with this model. 
__label__neu	I bought this breast pump after a mother of 3 recommended buying a medela pump and after buying the manual medela harmony pump. 
__label__pos	Bottom line, my son has enjoyed his Bright Starts Around We go for three times as long and counting.
__label__neg	It is obvious they are not in the water(not a problem on the older model), it would make better bubbles too. 
__label__neu	These are almost just like a bottle nipple,  except the nipple is flat at the tip.
__label__pos	They help get my milk started because they apply a light pressure which also helps extent the nipple.
__label__pos	We've used our first one for four years and have just given both (the first and second) away to the Women's Shelter were they were very welcome.
__label__neu	He is now 6 weeks old and weighs a little over 9 pounds, he can't hold his head up for extended periods of time and he isn't incredible active. 
__label__neu	Does it give me a place to put her when we are out running errands on the weekend.
__label__neu	we use that for our elongated seats,  and this ring for the tiny toilet that's in the hallway
__label__neu	My wife bought a bunch of these and matching bottles in the big BPA scare last year.
__label__pos	For some reason, she loves to be swaddled and we have been swaddling her since she was a week or so old.  
__label__neg	 Don't be lulled into a false sense of security believing that using this won't interfere with early breastfeeding
__label__neg	 I mean if it's the only one you have then it's fine because you can still hear your child, but the amount of static is annoying and kind of distracting if you are trying to do work
__label__neg	The PUL lining is virtually gone in both of my bags despite line drying them.
__label__pos	"The songs and stories are so sweet, especially the ""What Does the World Look Like"" story. "
__label__pos	We bought this monitor because so many reviews said they had no to little problems with static with this monitor. 
__label__pos	This is a great little pump.
__label__pos	The perfect kit!
__label__pos	"""When the car seat adapter is connected, you will have plenty of room to get to the under carriage basket."""
__label__neg	Instead,  the cup has to be lifted right over the child's head in order for them to get any liquid out
__label__pos	"""When she cried all the lights glowed."""
__label__neg	"When you turn up the volumne,  even if the monitor and hand units are in separate rooms,  they will make a horrible sound as though they are still ""too close"",  so you have to turn down the volumne thus making it nearly impossible to hear the sounds of your baby- especially over all the static"
__label__neg	perhaps when he's older he can handle the rate of flow for the stage 2 nipple
__label__neu	I bought this potty seat for my son thinking it looked great and fisher-price ALMOST ALWAYS makes great things,  but I was wrong with this one.
__label__neu	We used the sling when he was a newborn, and now my 12-month old is still using the bath on the toddler side.  
__label__pos	He doesn't know how to play with such toys but he is always happy to see his train and likes when I show it to him.
__label__neu	I live in a condo and have cordless phones and wireless internet.
__label__neg	I finally managed to rig something up though but after just a short time the mirror surface was fogging and unclear
__label__pos	No smells at all!
__label__pos	I'd never buy another brand!
__label__pos	At 5'2 it's just perfect for me.
__label__neg	First it was too big
__label__pos	I use this sheet for my baby's arm's reach co-sleeper; it fits perfectly and doesn't bunch up at all. 
__label__neg	Then I discovered what a waste of money it was.
__label__pos	I got it for my 2 month old who likes melodies and he was enthralled with it!
__label__neu	The thrid and final straw,  and what made me throw this money wasted apperattus away was that when I got the bottom of the stack of wipes,  I noticed that the wipe on the bottom was brown.
__label__neg	The only other disadvantage of this potty is that the seat area is a little small, and you have to be careful that boys don't scrape their weenies when sitting or getting up from this chair.
__label__pos	It's QUITE a necessity.
__label__neg	 If your spigot has a flat-top shower pull-up or it can be unscrewed, then perhaps you can make this work
__label__neu	I so wanted to like this for my son,  it is well-designed,  a one-piece teether that is very easy to keep clean and best of all it is one that he really enjoys.
__label__pos	And because the bottle is lightweight and has a hollow bottom, my baby can easily hold the bottle to drink by herself.
__label__pos	We recommend this to all new parents.
__label__pos	They also do well in the washer/dryer
__label__neu	My husband and I originally tried the Avent bottles after several recommendations from previous users and after doing some research on our own.
__label__neu	I ended up putting a thin blanket in the packnplay and tucking it into the sides instead
__label__pos	"""I love how this has music and a spinning action above her."""
__label__neg	5 months old, and already I need to buy a new stroller, since the daughter in the rear can't be strapped in anymore or her feet will be pinched between the seats
__label__neu	"""I then went without a carrier, but my daughter had bad gas when she was younger so we would get tired of holding her."""
__label__neg	My only problem is that now that he is almost 20 pounds it really weighs down on my shoulders and if I carry him in it for too long I am really sore.  
__label__neg	I wouldn't want to put anything of my sons in them for fear paint chips would get on his things. 
__label__neu	Shake the heck out of it to mix, then a few hours later the bubbles have settled.
__label__pos	We could get away with dressing the baby in a onesie and then relied on these for extra warmth if there was a breeze.
__label__neg	I just wrote the company today and am waiting for a response.
__label__neg	Save your $$ and/or those of your friends/family who get it for you!
__label__neu	"""I don't know that they did anything about it, but I felt better."""
__label__neg	first of all, they fall off the windows constantly
__label__neu	She is now two and uses just the big potty but every now and then she still asks for this!
__label__neg	 and I did
__label__pos	"""I liked them so much that I bought some recently for my daughter (4) and son (11 months) and we do the same thing with them at home on the tile - race them."""
__label__pos	The hangings are great for the nursery with interesting characters, great colors, and a mixture of fabrics for depth and texture.
__label__pos	The good points of this product are that it tilts so that one can TRY to find a space for the lights to project and you have 4 choices of music to choose from. 
__label__neu	I bought it for her when she was 4 mos old.  
__label__pos	"""Four sounds, light, etc. - you will be glad you bought it."""
__label__neu	Why
__label__neu	Our little one is a bit over 5 months old and has been using this since she was first born. 
__label__pos	And it's nice that it's natural rubber.
__label__pos	But hey if you want to drill holes somewhere and hang with screws then it should do the trick
__label__pos	For a newborn it is awesome - other carriers can feel awkward but this carrier adjusts to the size.
__label__pos	When we push it toward him, he squeals with laughter and joy.  
__label__pos	They are super easy to use stains easily sunned out of this diaper and they wash beautifully.
__label__pos	 I still can't stand the boppy for nursing, but I really love it for a cushion when they are sitting up!
__label__pos	"""I would buy these again and would recommend them to a friend."""
__label__pos	It's been great for my twins.
__label__pos	This gate saved me money...
__label__neg	I thought my baby would be mesmerized and fascinated by the lighted musical waterfall
__label__neg	 In the instructions it says that there is no way to replace the batteries 
__label__pos	Don't hesitate !
__label__neg	 I found this carrier to be incredibly uncomfortable- hurt my back and shoulders after 10 minutes of use. 
__label__neu	IT IS SO SOFT AND WARM
__label__neu	After suffering with repeatedly having to retie the knot to start the sausages over we finally took it to the dumster.
__label__neg	Be careful to always buckle baby in or else she slides downwards pretty easily and quickly.
__label__neu	Because of that,  I was hesitant to purchase the 2 oz cubes,  but I gave them a try anyway
__label__pos	And just like the other mom said, put them in this with the Baby Einstein on and you've got yourself one life saving baby cocktail!
__label__neu	I wanted something that would make my life easier with two car seats.  
__label__pos	I can not compare to other brands but I can tell you that she doesn't spit up, which may be her naturally, but I wouldn't switch from these bottles just in case. 
__label__pos	It took a couple of weeks for him to adjust to it, but now he loves it and goes right to sleep when we put it on him and set him in the crib.
__label__neg	 There is no way I will be able to tolerate the motor to put my baby to sleep
__label__neg	Babies often can't wait that long.
__label__neg	This is the Boppy Bounce in Comfort Bouncer, however, the description on Amazon is for the Boppy Cradle in Comfort Bouncer
__label__neu	"We use them as a deterant and NOT as a ""babysitter."" "
__label__pos	Excellent item and well priced.
__label__pos	We just finished up a Disneyworld vacation and this bag was SO EASY to carry, and fits enough supplies for 2 feedings, 5 diaper changes and 2 outfit changes (4 month old).  
__label__pos	BY FAR THE BEST BABY ITEM!!
__label__neg	I have been searching for a way to keep my 3-year-old out of her closet,  and so I was thrilled when I found this product.
__label__pos	"""My only complaint is that the front doesn't fold down."""
__label__pos	This sheet is so soft
__label__neu	The store I bought it from has since stopped stocking this model.
__label__neu	"""So as a result, they gave her a bottle in the nursery."""
__label__pos	Since she was born in the winter, I gave her a bath in the bathroom so that I could get it really warm.
__label__neu	Dont know.
__label__neg	"""My back cannot really support this weight for very long..."""
__label__pos	"""You soak right through them."""
__label__neg	 I only used this pillow for 3-4 months before using one of my regular pillows with a waterproof pad under because it was cumbersome and already losing shape
__label__pos	It keeps the baby warm and secure, and has a nice snug fit. 
__label__neu	Gary Peterson
__label__neu	Also you are able to nurse hands free and discreetly
__label__neu	The lids do not stay on after being screwed on.
__label__pos	I don't always use the entertainment bar, but when I do, he loves it!  
__label__neu	 yes and with only 4 oz to show
__label__neg	It came in a box with numerous pieces of wood and a bag full of 100 different screws and brackets.
__label__pos	It holds so much and is very durable.
__label__pos	 However, I really like the laugh 'n learn because it had more activities
__label__neg	I am very disappointed how rough they feel after being washed
__label__neu	"""Thus, I really didn't have a need for this."""
__label__neu	This item is serviceable and probably something you could buy to use to basically get ruined without stressing about it. 
__label__neg	I packed it back up and will be returning it for sure
__label__pos	 It is tall, and allows better use of space. 
__label__neg	We have to leave the drawer open so the rail can't fall all the way down
__label__neg	For some reason,  no matter which store purchased at,  every nipple (Stage 1 and Stage 2) seemed to not be opened to allow milk to come out
__label__pos	Oslo, the dog is her new favorite chew thing.
__label__pos	It is this feature that I also enjoy since in the event of a black out,  we have one light that will automatically come on.
__label__pos	It seems pretty easy to clean (I've wiped it down and mildly cleaned it - nothing too serious as it hasn't gotten that dirty).
__label__neu	We tried shutting that monitor off,  and plugging the second in the kitchen outlet - the entire length of the house away.
__label__pos	It did,  as long as I was sitting down
__label__neg	 The pump squeaked sometimes and I couldn't quite figure out why
__label__pos	The biggest plus is it's faster to prepare.
__label__neu	You can try again since it only takes seconds.
__label__pos	Our baby is 12 months old now and can stillswing in it.
__label__neu	I didn't use it until my daughter was 5 months.
__label__pos	Now that baby is around, I love putting him in the carrier and taking him around, not just because I can free up both my hands, but mostly because we get to spend quality time very close together, and the movement when I walk seems to soothe him (unless he's hungry, of course!)
__label__pos	it looks intimidating at first,  but then you get the hang of it
__label__pos	Really like that it swings sideways as well as back and forth.
__label__neu	Yes it is soft but look at others.
__label__neu	This is the sort of thing that can be quickly and cheaply done at the factory
__label__pos	10X Better than Boppy, easy to clean, use it standing up!
__label__pos	Worth the price for peace of mind re: safety.
__label__pos	The quality is great as with any Chicco product the colors are appealing and my baby loves it.
__label__neg	I feel bad that I purchased this product only to throw it in a landfill...regrets. 
__label__neg	I wish i had talked to other SUV owners before i bought this one to see what else they recommended
__label__neu	 My only comlaint is that they don't have handles and are a little big
__label__neu	The only reason I give it 4 stars is that I wish it had a little padding around the edge where the child leans over.  
__label__neu	The curved edges of the tub don't allow the basket to sit entirely on the edge, and I have the basket extended to it's largest size.  
__label__neu	You're going back to work- Your milk supply is medium to low- You plan to pump more than two or three times per month- You are opposed to giving your baby any formula,  ever (with a higher quality pump you could build up reserve breastmilk to have in case of an emergency)Also,  it's worth noting that most of the more expensive models can be safely re-used by other people so could be sold to someone else when you're done (unlike this one
__label__neg	Then, even with the little sleeves, my 16 month old managed to pull it off right away, so unless you can watch your kid like a hawk when he's eating, I'd look elsewhere.
__label__pos	The pocket is perfectly placed and the shoulders are wide enough to protect her sleeves.
__label__pos	I love the color cause it matches our travel system(Graco Quattro-Mocha) and the head support fits inside the bundle me so she still has head support. 
__label__neu	Also, it picks up on our cellphones as well as the house phone. 
__label__neg	I have not noticed any less gas,  either,  and the nipples flow way too fast for him,  even though I purchased the smallest size
__label__neu	so maybe for 4-6 month olds
__label__neg	"This monitor is ""staticky"""
__label__pos	 However, as a pillow to prop your baby for tummy time or to sit up I give this pillow a 4 star rating. 
__label__pos	"Our first gate made it through a cross-country move with ""Break and Dent Van Lines"" with no issues..."
__label__pos	"""It is plastic but still it hurts!"""
__label__neu	I used these for storing milk in the beginning.
__label__neg	 Actually, nothing comes out unless you milk the nipple, or more obviously, if the baby is sucking on it
__label__neg	"""The slow-flow is not slow enough for a baby who is accustomed to breast feeding and having to work at gettimg milk out."""
__label__neg	It turns off for maybe 5 minutes then it comes on by itself.
__label__pos	It was really the onlt blanket I used to cover/wrap her.
__label__pos	"I bought one for each of my two triplet boys.Pro: Color stays well, nice deeper pockets, not a ""just barely fits the mattress"" style.Con: A little loose."
__label__neg	 The problem with having to strap the car seat down is that the strap goes OVER the baby's chubby legs and/or belly
__label__neu	Boy was I wrong.
__label__neg	 My milk supply in time grew (not soon enough) I am still nursing and again the manuel pump and I did NOT have a good relationship
__label__pos	I like them though.
__label__neu	 This one and a deluxe version
__label__pos	Boons Let it Flo seemed like an awesome idea
__label__pos	It's long enough to cover his lap beyond the highchair tray (if you don't use a tray, part of the legs will still be exposed for spills).
__label__neg	 Only it was defective
__label__neu	Currently we are using one gate to block off the bottom of the stairs and one at the top (we're in a rental home and cannot bolt the sturdier ones to the wall). 
__label__neu	Especially,  when the other brands are holding up just fine after the same number of washes.
__label__neg	These pads don't absorb much at all.
__label__neu	I read a book and two before making the transition from the bottle to the sippy cup, right before my son's 1st b-day! 
__label__pos	At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth.
__label__neg	My son's room smelled as if we threw the dirty diapers in an open garbage.
__label__neu	In hindsight though, we could just fill up the bottom of the sink with hot water.
__label__neg	There is room for 2 large bottles, but i think it would be better to just buy a lunch bag and use it with removable freezer packs that take up less space.
__label__neu	The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is beause I wish it was bigger
__label__neg	 For the longest time I couldn't figure out why my son screamed every time I laid him on the Safer Bather, and then one day I felt the cold water coming up out of it as I was bathing him
__label__neu	Is that really saving money??
__label__pos	Sippy Cup easy for baby to drink from
__label__pos	I'm so happy I took a chance on this product!
__label__neg	:(
__label__neu	Totally distorted,  useless.
__label__neu	We wanted something her feet touched the floor in and some reviewers said their smaller babies did touch
__label__neu	"And,  although it's a great idea,  when I tried out this tub at girlfriend's,  I didn't find it to be as designed to hold the baby as well as others (which I've found to be SO much more important then a ""shower"")My daughter was 4 months at the time,  and was too big for the ""net"" (her legs had no where to fit) but without it,  there is no recline option,  just plain basin tub,  which was difficult because she could not yet sit."
__label__neg	Boppy Flowers and Chocolate Slipcover PinkIt is a bummer in the middle of the night if your baby spits- up or has a blow- through diaper.
__label__neu	She tried it,  made an awful face and refused to put it near her face again.
__label__neg	yuck, makes me squeemish.
__label__pos	"""It's her favorite car toy."""
__label__pos	"""When I work in there I play with them with the little ones and we race them."""
__label__pos	It is never pulled tight or twisted.
__label__pos	Worth EVERY penny.
__label__pos	"""And practically speaking, stratch another item off that long baby shopping list--with this you can forget the diaper pail refills and just use the good old kitchen garbage bags that are sitting under your sink."""
__label__pos	He is now 14 months and it is still perfect.
__label__pos	The Miracle Blanket was easy to use and our little guy couldn't break out of it.
__label__neu	This is one of those rare occasions.
__label__neg	There is nothing going on with it, nothing happening, nothing exciting.
__label__pos	The very first moment she saw Sophie, she smiled. 
__label__pos	It's also very easy to change--no confusing bag twisting.
__label__neg	 She is strapped in and correctly positioned, but the straps do not hold a baby in place to where she can't fling herself over the side. 
__label__pos	The silicone massage cushion works wonders and makes the pump very effective.
__label__neg	 This is just one of several packaging problems I've had with amazon over the last month (amazon has not been packaging my items carefully, leading to damaged items)
__label__neu	We ordered this for my wife because she was a little uncomfortable with breastfeeding in public, mainly because of having to expose her midriff with most shirts.
__label__neu	The brush and comb are okay
__label__neg	 Born Free, Medela, Avent, Nuby, etc
__label__pos	"""This placemat works very well; it catches most of the food that doesn't quite make it into our one-year-old little guy's mouth."""
__label__neu	I've never had a problem with those leaking or ruining my milk.
__label__pos	Super good for taking on the road to clean faces and hands with a little water or camomile/jojoba oil mix  (wipes can cause allergy and often contain perfume and should really never be used on baby's face).
__label__pos	Would highly recommend.
__label__pos	I love that it doesn't matter what end you set it on.
__label__neg	She is impatient when it comes to waiting so I thought this little unit would do the trick.
__label__neu	I have completely replaced all of our Avent bottles with the Playtex Nursers. 
__label__pos	It's crystal clear and we live in housing on an Air Force base where there is a lot of other monitors and cordless phones close by.
__label__pos	Great product!
__label__neg	 I cut one up and used it as a template to make my own changing pad covers out of old towels, that was the only good thing it did for me
__label__pos	The tub itself is a nice size and comes with the sling which helps a lot.  
__label__pos	It also has a feature for responding to your baby.
__label__neg	What a waste of money.
__label__pos	They washed up pretty nice.
__label__neg	Putting it back together feels like you are building a model airplane (if you can manage to keep track of all the parts
__label__pos	"""A little of everything."""
__label__neg	I thought I had found the gate.
__label__neg	 Brown's (standard nipple), I found that Dr
__label__pos	which is adorable! 
__label__pos	The star is detatachable and made many trips to Grandma's house with us to place in her pack and play.
__label__pos	"""Both helped my baby sleep better and longer."""
__label__pos	So pleased with this stroller!!!!
__label__neg	I never even used the music part of it so i cannot review that but i think that it is useless. 
__label__neu	ours secured to the tether at the top of the headrest, but if we get into that bad of a crash, I'm sure window glass, or something, would be more of a hazard.
__label__pos	There are alot of settings for different sounds and I like that it has a 1 hour timer feature.
__label__pos	We didn't get much use out of the potty book that comes with it, but it's a cute idea.
__label__pos	So easy to use, it's the only one I ever used!
__label__pos	Handy, Cute, Entertaining
__label__pos	i have tried many sippy cups with my now 3 year old and none have compared to this one. 
__label__neu	I expect and HOPE it does the same for my new son.
__label__neu	IT IS ALSO IN MANY DAYCARES/ PRESCHOOLS.
__label__pos	If you follow the directions with the package, your wipe warmer will be fine!
__label__pos	"""It's well constructed."""
__label__pos	I can turn it down low so I can barely hear the music.  
__label__neu	 I have thought about buying a better tub, but since we are so close to graduating him to the big tub, I don't want to spend the money. 
__label__pos	I like these the best.
__label__neu	I registered for this product and received it at my baby shower
__label__pos	"""We are extremely happy with this tub and would have rated it five stars, except for the fact that it is HUGE."""
__label__neg	Yet this seemed too short for me too
__label__pos	We've had great luck with this tub. 
__label__pos	 For gas, I recommend Hyland's Colic Tablets over anything else (and we've tried everything-having 2 gassy, gassy babies
__label__neu	When I went to use it, I was very surprised to see that it activated itself.  
__label__pos	Since then,  my baby eats better,  sleeps better,  cries less
__label__pos	The cusions also wash and wear beautifully.
__label__pos	It's nice to have insetead of a playard because you can sit in there with the kid and hang out with him.
__label__neg	 Too bad it isn't made as well as Sophie. 
__label__pos	So far I like these better.
__label__pos	We bought as an extra base for our other car and makes it easier for us to use whichever car to take our daughter without having to move car seat base.  
__label__neu	I just cannot decide about this sling!
__label__neg	 I think that for the price, it should have lasted longer than two months
__label__neu	I use the Skip Hop pacifier pod to keep it clean and free of lint in my bag.
__label__neu	we would press the red foot,  and it would say yellow
__label__neg	After going through a box of Dr
__label__pos	Along with the swing, the bouncer and a few other pieces of gear, it will not only make your first few parenting weeks easier to deal with but it will reward you time and again with unforgettable moments with your baby!
__label__neu	The directions say to wet the rim to prevent leaking
__label__neu	After some research, we decided to buy the Britax Marathon for our daughter.
__label__neg	OK so this doesnt fold compact like the new saucers advertise to do but I don't mind b/c I happen to like this type of entertainer much better so that may be the one and only downside.
__label__pos	You won't regret it!
__label__pos	i like the khaki just in case of any stains/spills/spit up it camoflauges wonderfully!
__label__pos	expensive, but one of the items i use at least every other day.
__label__pos	I give not 1 but 2 stars because it is a good quality, strong, VERY easy to use baby carrier, BUT invest more money in it and buyBabyBj&ouml;rn Baby Carrier Synergy - BlackIt has that magic back support!
__label__neu	just trust me,  please don't buy this,  because I regret so much for buying this.
__label__pos	She says to tell you that it does a good job and has held up wonderfully over the past 6 months.
__label__pos	"""we take one bowl to restaurants and it's perfect for serving whatever we are eating."""
__label__neg	She cannot sit up on her own yet which means the tub is absolutely useless. 
__label__neg	They suggested the Evenflo classic bottles which are like these except plastic with the clear nipple.
__label__neu	We use Nestle Good Start with Active cultures which can sometimes have lumps.  
__label__neg	Wrong answer, I cracked the kneeler portion.
__label__pos	The pad wipes down well and if i'm going to have my daughter in there for a long time I use a waterproof pad under her. 
__label__neg	If you hate washing dishes,  this ain't for ya
__label__neu	""" It's not great to start potty training with a painful experience"
__label__pos	Great product to go with Superyard XT
__label__neg	 I have all the time in the world now compared to when baby arrives, so I hope that this problem resolves itself
__label__neu	Our handle for our stroller flips down to bring the stroller up to you when sitting.
__label__pos	I thought this mobile was very entertaining to my boy.
__label__pos	The toys easily remove so you can also attach them to a carseat or crib.
__label__pos	"""Other than that, they are very easy to care for."""
__label__neg	And the tweezers are very flimsy
__label__pos	"""It is the easiest car seat I've installed."""
__label__neu	"""We don't use it at the crib except during naps but I usually keep it hanging over the changing table."""
__label__neg	 The seat area was almost too small for him, so he was always uncomfortable
__label__neu	If you buy the Gerber baby food that comes in plastic tubs, it won't work on this organizer.
__label__neg	So we put it away until after the remodel.
__label__neg	My baby is 4
__label__neu	I knew a bassinet would only last so long and was told to not waste my money by more experienced moms. 
__label__neu	And the obvious change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.
__label__pos	I ended up with a snoogle and LOVE it
__label__pos	We completed the look with the mobile hamper  lamp and wall hangings and our son's nursery is really nice and comfortable.
__label__neg	I recommend the First Years Clean & Simple,  valve free!
__label__neu	So you have to adjust for the suitcase
__label__neu	 I'll be looking for a new gate now!
__label__neu	I bought a 2 pack of 4 oz bottles and regret doing so.
__label__neg	The main problem is with the flimsy and thin velcro that attaches the holder to the stroller won't keep anything upright so any liquid you put in the holder will spill.
__label__neu	all over the hardwood floors
__label__neu	My daughter was born prematurely and never really got the hang of breastfeeding
__label__neg	I did not believe myself to have large nipples but I was frustrated at how little milk I was getting with the standard size breastshield even with a hospital- grade pump (the Symphony).
__label__neg	 (It was not a pleasant task to retrieve it, either
__label__pos	I switched to these from Avent with no problems.
__label__neu	 First, she was too small, so I swaddled her using a traditional blanket
__label__neu	"""I drilled mine to the door posts because I didn't want to take any chances with my little one."""
__label__neu	My son very quickly learned to hold these upside down and press the soft spout against any flat surface.
__label__pos	Our daughter has used this tub since her first day home at 4 pounds and the tub has made bathing her very easy even that small!
__label__pos	You get what you pay for if you are going back to work you might want to invest in an electric Breast pump, I bought the Playtex Embrace double breast pump and it works wonderfully. 
__label__neu	There is the bottle itself,  handles,  screw cap,  mouth piece,  valve,  and finally the cap.
__label__pos	In our large 4500 square foot home, sound quality functions at every place and also in the garden everywhere outside without high-class loss. 
__label__neg	all I can say is the smell is horrible
__label__pos	It's not flimsy to me at all.
__label__pos	"""these bowls are awesome."""
__label__neu	We bought this without doing any research....we really wanted a 2nd one of the Evenflo Expressions that we love, but the store ran out,  so this was the next affordable choice.
__label__neu	I hate this tub!!! It leaks everywhere.
__label__neg	Do not buy this Swing
__label__pos	AWESOME.
__label__pos	"""You can put your baby in it from birth and it seems very comfortable."""
__label__neu	Alternate product recommendation - Sure Comfort Tub by The First Years.... now THAT is a good baby bathtub!!!
__label__neg	The only thing I have problems with is at speed 6 it bumps a little on each end and kinda jars him.
__label__pos	"""I put mine in my office and I can work but still be with my baby at the same time."""
__label__neg	Waste of money.
__label__neu	my home has a mix of elongated/round seats,  and i found that the baby bjorn rung is the best for the larger bowls
__label__pos	 Now in the car she hits the button and plays the music over and over again
__label__pos	We've been using it for almost 15 months now and still love it!
__label__neu	Don't you think those back straps will pull your shoulders forward?
__label__pos	"""For my first baby I had the maya ring sling and I decided to try this one with my second child and boy am I glad I did!"""
__label__neg	Save your money & buy the cheap $10 one that's one piece.
__label__neu	"""I have a 2.5 month old and 22 month old."""
__label__neg	 The water it soaks up makes it very heavy
__label__pos	When she is really cranky and we just can't walk with her anymore, we can put it in her and bounce her with our hands or feet to make her happy.
__label__neg	At first we didn't think our little one liked this, but with persistance, we have been successful.
__label__neg	Don't Start with a Starter Set!
__label__neu	I leave it on the counter and throw in pacifiers,  WASHED bottles,  etc all day then throw in the microwave when full
__label__pos	"""Now that she's older (8 mo), we use it at feedings and to keep her occupied for a little bit when we are doing something around the house."""
__label__neu	 And I searched for santoprene and it's apparently made by ExxonMobil Chemical co.!! 
__label__pos	I am using the Playtex Premium Nurser now and it's much better
__label__pos	then of course, you'll love these!  
__label__neg	 at birth and we tried it then
__label__neu	 and change its worth your sanity, sleep, time, energy and appreciation for the bond with the baby
__label__neg	Also the refills are expensive and it doesn't hold enough diapers IMO.
__label__neu	It's wide enough that I can just tuck the ends under the Cozy Wedge crib bumber and she has room to roll around in her sleep without it bunching up beneath her.  
__label__neg	They are still very cute from a distance, just be forewarned about the quality!
__label__neg	 We bought about 20 bottles
__label__neu	Moreso than anywhere else.
__label__pos	"""5)  Good door lock - don't think even older toddlers (under 3) could unlock it"""
__label__pos	"""I have never changed the batteries but I use it one time a day at the most."""
__label__pos	"""But if you don't have the time or really need the bottles to be extra safe/clean, then I suppose giving them a quick wash and popping them in this container for the microwave could be helpful."""
__label__pos	She's gotten positive reviews in several parenting magazines in the last few months.
__label__pos	Definitely worth getting!
__label__neu	I might give it a try.
__label__neg	one is not present
__label__neg	It would have been nice if you could take the napper off and use it somewhere else. 
__label__pos	You could just use your own cloth or towel but I like this product because it doesn't budge and is not bulky.
__label__pos	"""My little one had it all over her hands."""
__label__pos	 I still get some use out of it though
__label__neu	or press the white foot and it would say purple
__label__pos	The trundle drawer is somewhat silly (it would be better if it were connected to the crib), but may come in handy for storing extra blankets. 
__label__neu	It's meant to be a safe place you can put baby where s/he can play with toys and bounce a bit and keep them occupied while mom and dad do what they have to do
__label__neu	WOW!
__label__pos	"""i love the 3 different sizes."""
__label__pos	However if you don't have a dishwasher this is pretty nifty for the price.
__label__neg	"These plugs just slip in to the socket and there is nothing to keep them in there like the ""dual release"" plugs (which we have and work"
__label__neu	Starting as a newborn, my son would just lie on his back and stare at this thing, batting it around occasionally, for almost an hour at a time.  
__label__pos	"""This teether is not only safe (free of chemicals, etc) but it serves the purpose better than any other teether out there!"""
__label__neg	There is no way to attach it. 
__label__neg	"One minor complaint--the breastshields were not one-piece items (sold individually,  they are one-piece),  which makes it somewhat more difficult to clean,  as you need to break the pieces down,  and it's harder to see how your milk flow is going,  since the ""seam"" blocks your view a bit (plus,  the breastshields are more translucent than clear)"
__label__pos	This bottle is specifically designed to help babies latch on better and learn to breastfeed better.
__label__neg	Not as wide as the ComfortSportDoes not have EPS energy absorbing foamDoes not have GracoPedic luxury foam cushioned seatThe crotch buckle doesn't have enough slots for adjusting
__label__neg	Once you think you get it on, it just keeps falling off.
__label__neg	 We're going to get the Baby Bjorn instead upon recommendation from other parents
__label__neg	 My husband and I coudln't solve the leaking issue. 
__label__neg	lol I could see the suction was working, but not particularly strong & it didn't do a thing.I read the other reviews & I guess it depends on the person as some people obviously have no problems & others can't get the darn thing to work at all.
__label__neg	First of all, the item pictures shows twice as many as you really get
__label__pos	"""Also nice that instructions are printed on inside of carrier."""
__label__neg	If they're both loose.. Than geez I don't know.
__label__pos	It seems to be sturdy and well built and we've had no trouble at all with it.
__label__pos	~*DARN GOOD PRODUCT!
__label__neg	Obviously,  this isn't teaching our daughter anything
__label__neg	It's not that attractive, however.
__label__neu	Then,  they spent another hour trying to figure out how they were going to rig it up so it would work with our stairs
__label__neg	I saw one reviewer's pic with the grandson in this thing with a rolled up towel in between him and the edges- it is WAY big there
__label__neg	Still a hassle to remove the
__label__neg	 In addition to the leakage I noticed that my son was extremely gassy and would cry so much after eating
__label__neu	We use it if we go take the dog out or to do yard work while she's sleeping. 
__label__neg	It is a HASSLE to assemble the straps,  and once they are assembled,  they don't securely lock into place
__label__neg	 It's also difficult to get a good grip on the smooth, teeny handles that you need to twist to lock/set it. 
__label__neu	We got it when he was 3mos old...
__label__pos	"""Since just about every other item used for a baby takes batteries, it was nice to finally see a product with an A/C adapter."""
__label__neg	By the way it looked online, i thought it was a small one day diaper bag, but it was bigger.
__label__pos	This is a good tub for transition between newborn to toddler
__label__neg	:-(  It just simply sticks out too far and isn't secure enough, though it is nice that it folds against the side when not in use (or you can just take it off completely). 
__label__neu	Maybe for older kids it may work
__label__pos	So rarely can you find everyone you need all in one product.
__label__pos	This Pack N Play has so many cool things, Vibration, Music and lights, mobile, shade, Changing Table, bassinet.
__label__pos	"""She loved to be in it and it was not painful on our backs at all!"""
__label__neu	on the floor on the chair and best of all on the go!
__label__neu	Our PeekaBoo Clutch Cube looks a bit different than this one...
__label__neu	Invest in better quality wipes rather than this wipe warmer.
__label__neg	I've had this pillow for 3 weeks and I am still not convinced.it does kind of help but I still find myself laying on the other side.
__label__pos	"""This product isn't that bad..."""
__label__neu	Plugged in it's still great,  but it's a hassle to have to lug the plug around the house during the day.
__label__neu	He is comfortable and there is enough water around him to keep him warm and for him to splash.
__label__pos	I love this potty seat. 
__label__neg	 The motor isn't particularly powerful, the music isn't very soothing, and I don't think she feels secure being so close to the floor
__label__neg	He starts crying 5 min after listening to them.
__label__neg	 Buy Dr
__label__pos	"""I'd give it 4 stars from our experience."""
__label__pos	This is a great carrier that is well worth the extra money it costs.  
__label__pos	After my husband figured out how to place it, we realized this was a great product! 
__label__pos	 I would recommend this swing to anyone
__label__neg	Kind of like a taco!
__label__neu	I had to switch to breastfeeding exclusively,  with no bottles,  to stimulate my milk supply back,  but now my daughter refuses to take a bottle what so ever
__label__neu	YES they will.
__label__neg	"""Among other things, we were never able to figure out how to get this thing to work."""
__label__pos	So much easier to find the exact food I am looking for.
__label__neu	I bought one of these bottles because i likes the idea of being more like the breast,  and i wanted to breast feed
__label__neg	I don't trust that no damage is going to occur.
__label__neg	When it came down to it I couldn't make myself spend the extra money for something that needed expensive refills.
__label__pos	That is all I need.
__label__neg	Another bad thing is they aren't biodegradable, maybe they should change that
__label__neu	The only thing is that sometimes it's just easier to note the time if you don't have the Itzbeen with you.
__label__pos	"""This Eurobath is wonderful."""
__label__pos	I love this bouncer.
__label__neu	This product is a great concept,  BUT it has a critical flaw for me.
__label__neg	 That left a residue at the bottom of the warmer which would emit a weird odor that might make you think something is burning
__label__neg	My son is 6 months old and can barely reach the floor. 
__label__neg	 It's these idiotic bottles
__label__neg	I honestly bled almost every time
__label__neg	"""I definately don't think this tub is appropriate for small babies."""
__label__pos	It works great for this!
__label__neu	It has a hanger that is attached so you just hang it to let it dry. 
__label__neu	However,  everything clogged in them and it never worked well for me at all.
__label__pos	"""Something about it absolutely mesmerized him."""
__label__neu	Our baby wasn't interested at all in sucking on anything in it.
__label__pos	It is basically for design now and to match my son's bedding
__label__neg	 No lights, no music, I could have just purchased a $1
__label__neg	I have a hard time putting these against my skin so it pains me knowing that my precious little one with his sensitive skin is sleeping on these.
__label__neg	 I wanted mainly for a sling, so that in public I could nurse without attracting to much attention, but it was too long and too much of a hassle to put it on so we returned it
__label__pos	Our daughter loves this playmat!
__label__neu	Go with a Jolly Jumper or Joovy Organizer instead.
__label__neu	I rather prepare a few carrots, a few apples and oranges, and other small recipes, than have a whole lot of one thing.
__label__neu	The parent unit can easily clip onto your pants,  or you can put it in your back or shirt pocket
__label__pos	this will keep you from having to hold the baby while bathing her, just lean her back into the cushion and wash with BOTH HANDS!
__label__pos	This is GREAT if you have an infant and toddler!
__label__neg	 Do not buy it
__label__neu	I am not a huge person,  but a little larger than average,  and this pillow just DID NOT work for me.
__label__neu	I received this gym at my baby shower so my baby (who is 7 months old now) has been playing with it for awhile now.
__label__neu	The venting also seems to work as she doesn't swallow a lot of air - doesn't burp or get gas a lot
__label__neg	I hate these bottles and plan to switch!!!
__label__neu	"Our daughter is always supervised, but it's nice to have a ""split second accident preventer."" "
__label__pos	She is now 11 months and they have held up great.
__label__pos	Easy to Use
__label__neu	i did get the baskets from PBK to store stuff neatly on the shelves.
__label__neu	Plus,  when you realize how many cycles the hospital pumps go through to get however much milk,  that's a lot of squeezing,  which is also not relaxing.
__label__pos	My little baby girl loves this chair.  
__label__pos	 I prefer the Munchkin brand of dishwasher basket. 
__label__neu	Who pays for that?
__label__neg	The most frustrating thing for me though is that after using it for a little over a month the little white disk would pop out of place, just when I would get a really strong suction going.
__label__neu	I have tried to play with how I screw on the lids,  or how tight they are (or are not) but the formula just pours out the side of the bottle.
__label__neu	Since we bought the dekor plus it is bigger, but since the smell keeps getting out we have never even allowed more than a day's diapers -5- to stay in there.
__label__neu	"""of course if your toddler keeps yanking at it then it will come off."""
__label__neg	The only thing I would change - make the hook removeable.  
__label__pos	The end result is a very tight but comfortable looking coocoon that works!
__label__pos	I would recommend this.
__label__neg	 I think it's a flaw in the motor
__label__neu	This is one of those products that can be terrific for some people and bad for others.
__label__neg	The only con lies with the issue of portability.  
__label__neg	We bought this cup for our 6 month old and from the very beginning it leaked. 
__label__neu	"I was initially dissapointed I did not buy one of the new tubs with a ""shower"" like this one."
__label__pos	"""Overall, this is a great monitor and a very great price."""
__label__pos	It has held up well and is easy to clean. 
__label__pos	This has worked so much better than rolled up towels which are constantly moving.
__label__neg	I tried to eat an apple slice through it.
__label__neg	 it wasn't hot enough
__label__neg	"""It's not that great for nursing--the brest friend works better."""
__label__pos	"""It makes life so much easier being able to take the baby car seat out of the car and just click it on to the stroller."""
__label__neu	Although it was easy to get it in there that didn't mean it was CORRECTLY installed.
__label__neu	Just go buy a normal body pillow.  
__label__pos	It's so much more effective and easy to use than the Diaper Genie, and you use your own tall kitchen garbage bags.
__label__neu	But I'm planning to sand it down a bit, which will probably resolve things - and THAT will be our preferred new and improved Genie.
__label__neu	I currently put her on the safer bather (read my review) or put her in the tub alone.
__label__pos	This was also easy to take to parks, etc. and the cloth cover is easy to take off for washing.  
__label__pos	It's great for travel, and the items are well made and attractive in appearance.
__label__neu	"I tried twisting the top of the nipple to ""open"" the hole and tried again"
__label__neg	In the beginning the musical star startled him and we left it off.
__label__neg	- measurements are WAY off (8 oz bottles will NOT hold 8 oz)- extremely hard to read the off measurements when baby has drank a couple ounces
__label__neg	 Very noisy
__label__pos	"""This swing is excellent."""
__label__pos	And the back support is a life saver since my 5 month old is already 18 lbs.So...take my advice.
__label__pos	My daughter is 1 year old now and we've only had to buy maybe 4 refills so far.
__label__pos	It is very safe as it comes with a kickstand to prevent falling forward.
__label__neu	You can't help but get milk on it sometimes...or spit up.
__label__pos	Works great for collecting leaked breastmilk and thereby minimizing waste; ventilated shells are great relief for injured nipples; appearance drastically improves if worn with a lightly padded braProduct comes with two soft bases (rings fitting around nipple) and two sets of covers.
__label__pos	my baby likes to hang one foot off the side and dip it in the warm water.
__label__pos	In addition, the design allows you to use the set through your child's toddlers year.
__label__neu	I contacted customer service and they were very helpful offering suggestions,  though they did not offer a refund since it had been several months since the purchase
__label__neg	I had nothing but leakage problems with these bottles
__label__neg	"I was hesitant to buy too since the ""sheet"" is expensive and hardly a ""sheet"" at all."
__label__pos	Six months later this sterilizer has done very well under heavy use (6+x/day) I quickly learned to use oven mitts to remove it from the microwave.
__label__neg	This makes the cup virtually useless for me because I bought it so my son could carry it around the house without spilling all over the place! 
__label__neg	for 24 hours
__label__pos	I just open the plug and wait for the water to leave (holding the plug open with one finger speeds the process).
__label__pos	Since this is the only monitor I have had experience with, I can only rate it based on how it has worked for me.I have been very happy with this monitor.
__label__pos	The fit is great and texture is great too.
__label__neu	Maybe if they had a thinner mesh??
__label__neu	I have to readjust my position to avoid that.
__label__pos	It pumped better for me than the Symphony did in the hospital.
__label__pos	I would rather throw the diapers on our kitchen trash can.
__label__neu	 I was in pain for days after I gave birth,irritable because of the lost of sleep and trying to conform to the babies temporary sleeping pattern
__label__neu	But it does make it seem safer.
__label__neu	"""to remove, just use the tip of your finger."""
__label__neu	It's great to have a clean surface on which to put our babies food and not to have to carry dishes with us when we travel.
__label__neg	There is tons of static and extra noise
__label__neu	I did not,  however,  have peeling paint,  as others have.
__label__pos	I love it and have taken it to concerts in the park, picnics, festivals, wineries - basically any place where we might want to relax outdoors and not worry about finding provided seating.
__label__neu	It was a difficult first baby shots day and he was hurting on both legs.
__label__neg	 I would suggest that parents shop around before purchasing an item that is cheaper
__label__pos	"""This is great for babies learning to crawl and beyond."""
__label__neg	The little Elmos are the only pieces that are made of no-slip rubber.
__label__neu	 Might as well save myself the frustration and get my windows tinted
__label__pos	I liked the idea of taking it from room to room like others have said, but I'm finding that in reality, with a baby in one arm, I just can't.
__label__pos	This pump works better for me then the one from the hospital!
__label__neu	His feet either have a bell in them or are crinkly sounding; as is his scarf.  
__label__neu	While I was happy about being able to use regular trash bags,  that was all that really impressed me with the Diaper Champ.
__label__neg	Related: With this seat, you either suspend the baby *above* the water or waste dozens of gallons getting the water line high enough to *reach* the baby. 
__label__pos	it's worth the money and freedom your arms get *especially with a fussy baby always needing to be held*.
__label__neg	"""This diaper stacker is a joke."""
__label__pos	After holding a baby for so long, your arm gets numb so I used this pillow to just hold my baby and still rest my arms.
__label__neu	Currently my little one is 5 months old and I have only just started putting him in the back position.
__label__neu	I have a hand wash,  line dry car seat cover and this just doesn't cut it at all.
__label__pos	I took both out of my car.
__label__neu	Please,  I have it,  my daughter is 9mths old and ask me how many times have I used it
__label__pos	The inflatable tub works well.
__label__neu	Here's some tricks for this Champ.1.
__label__neu	ADDITIONAL INFO
__label__pos	The contoured seat in the Space Saver High Chair helps to prevent that.
__label__pos	we liked it for the first few time he got a bath.
__label__pos	It's very comfortable and convenient to use.
__label__neu	** AGAIN- These collars on these bottles WILL fit ANY Midela bottle Assuming you match the right nipple with the right collar.
__label__neu	I thought that I just had to have this bottle warmer.
__label__neg	I don't know how this chair has passed so many safety standards.
__label__pos	"""This product is a must have for all moms!"""
__label__pos	We were so grateful to receive this at a baby shower- it was something we really wanted.  
__label__neu	Impractical execution,  though.
__label__neu	Most of the cheaper ones are too small for when the baby grows past a few months.  
__label__neu	Secondly,  you have to push it WITH the diaper - and you can imagine that you might get your hands dirty doing that
__label__neg	 I know there are not many hygeia pumpers out there but just in case, save yourself the time and the money and don't buy it as it does not convert for the hygeia threading. 
__label__neu	The crotch strap would not budge,  and the whole seat was very flimsy with tons of straps.
__label__pos	And this bouncy seat/rocker has been one of my favorites!
__label__neu	"""my husband and I decided it was time to at least let him go to bed earlier than we did so that we could have some alone time."""
__label__neg	 I then bought the Ergo carrier and my son and I are comfortable and happy and we can continue to comfortably use it until he is 50 lbs (not that I will
__label__neu	the shower is extremely weak and the water flow is so slow that i stopped using it few minutes after the first time i tried this product.
__label__neu	I can't imagine going home from the hospital without being able to see our newborn along the way.
__label__neg	Gets the counter soaking wet because it leaks
__label__pos	My six week old loves it too.
__label__neg	Surprised at the hassle and the warmer now serves limited purpose
__label__pos	(I cleaned and dried it immediately, and never had any problems.)
__label__pos	He loves to shake it and listen to the snackies inside, then he just reaches in that cute little hand and grabs a snack and just grins. 
__label__neu	It's all part of the joy of having a baby boy
__label__neu	I even searched for information about Recalls on this warmer but found nothing.
__label__pos	We ended up buying the Primo Eurobath and it's perfect!
__label__pos	I got this as a registry gift (and added it from a recommendation from a friend), and I am so happy we have it.  
__label__neu	There are several different materials on the quilt, which adds texture.
__label__pos	These were so cute when I got them in the mail.
__label__neu	I ended up returning it to BRU
__label__neg	finally gave up. 
__label__neg	"""The design leaves MANY crevices where mold develops (under the flip top, the spout area, in and around the inside..)."""
__label__neu	Hope this helps!
__label__pos	I ended up buying a used Pump-in-Style online and love it. 
__label__neu	Evenflo has removable and REPLACABLE toys
__label__neu	I thought it would keep his drinks cold in the summer and be easy for him to use.
__label__neg	 It would shift and semi-collapse in use if my son squirmed and all in all made potty trips a bad experience
__label__neg	 He hates them
__label__neu	I bought it because it was cheaper than baby bjorn and I thought that it would be the same,  but I just do not feel that it is that sturdy.
__label__pos	"""I call this the best $40 I ever spent since it is so versatile."""
__label__pos	my son has loved this toy since he was 5months old (i have posted pics). 
__label__neu	We registered and recieved the Baby Einstein Center thinking that we were getting the most edicational product for our child--atleast for stationary entertainers.  
__label__neu	Whatever it is,  I (and others,  clearly) found this product wildly disappointing.
__label__neg	It's very floppy / flimsy and really doesn't provide any support for the babies head (which is why we thought it would be good to have)Plus you only use it for about a month or two.
__label__neg	 I have returned mine and indicated to Amazon the incorrect descriptor on the website
__label__neg	I've got two in diapers now and there is no way I can continue with this one any more.
__label__neg	It is very uncomfortable for my daughter.
__label__neg	I really don't see the big deal about this toy,  and neither does my 10 month old
__label__pos	We finally found two places where the static isn't THAT bad and we now leave the monitors there,  plugged in and turned on ALL the time
__label__neu	I am able to get a 4-6 oz.
__label__neu	The view in this is very clear though small.
__label__neu	It ended up being very difficult to hold her upright at all times while trying to wash.
__label__neu	We actually have to Genies, one of the earlier model and one of the purportedly new and improved Diaper Genie. 
__label__neg	 We only have motor issues
__label__neg	These diaper doublers are paper thin
__label__pos	THey fit my oven knobs very loosely so my son likes to make them spin around and around
__label__neu	I expected great things from this blanket since Baby Bargains raved about it.
__label__neu	We absolutely hated the diaper genie.
__label__neg	Strangest thing I have ever seen.
__label__pos	This product exceeded my expectations.
__label__pos	We both appreciated the removable cover as we could easily freshen it up now and then.
__label__neu	I constantly get comments and questions about this stroller when I am out. 
__label__neg	No go,  as the seats are not individual
__label__neg	They are a disaster
__label__neu	 This shell does not have a foam insert, and is hard plastic.
__label__neu	 As the months go by, I realized that there are some things I could have done without
__label__pos	"""Her face lights up when she sees it because she knows she is headed out on the town!"""
__label__neu	I have a Munchkin car bottle warmer but it doesn't work on these bottles because of the liners.
__label__neg	My daughter liked the nipple but got to much air
__label__neu	We had a couple of these that were the Snack Trap brand that we had lost around town (they are probably underfoot at Target somewhere).  
__label__neg	The lids are so hard to screw on straight
__label__pos	This is a great concept, but... 
__label__neg	 It's so cheaply made, especially for the price
__label__neu	i had these and i tried it b/c my son wouldn't take the bottle after i breastfed for a month... 
__label__pos	"""I read the reviews of these bottles and purchsed one to try it out and it worked like a charm."""
__label__neu	The light shuts off when done, but if you leave the warmer on, it will heat through another cycle.  
__label__neg	I would have liked to see it be a little deeper as far as size goes,  my boys had a little trouble squeezing in when the protector was on
__label__neg	"""We also had trouble finding the replacement parts for the wide neck bottles."""
__label__neg	They are cute and a great idea,  but just not worth the money
__label__neg	 Our first son slept in it for 2 months and then refused to sleep in it. 
__label__neg	My 6 month old has fallen headfirst onto the cube and has cut her forehead and chin and jaw on the hard(!) unpadded edges. 
__label__pos	The stage 1 nipple on the Vent Aire is slow, but my baby keeps all her formula down now.
__label__pos	This is awesome!  
__label__neu	The adjustable height was useful for raising the tray to just above our table level so we could slide the whole chair underneath when not in use.
__label__neu	Our baby hated the bottle and wouldn't take the nipple.
__label__pos	I would actually consider using this as a daily pump at work!
__label__neu	I don't have a whole lot to say about this booster,  but wanted to note to other buyers that there is a potential tipping hazard with the seat
__label__pos	I love our papasan. 
__label__neg	 My son seemed interested in the toy, but grew frustrated after a while because the effect of hitting the red key with the setting on Spanish with one knob turned to the picture of the metronome with the other knob turned to the picture of the violin was completely different from the day before when he hit the red key with the setting on French with one knob turned to the picture of the keyboard and the other knob set to the picture of the clarinet
__label__neg	"""It takes too long."""
__label__neu	No screeching,  but it sounded like someone speaking from inside a tin can.
__label__neg	"""This was not a very wise purchase on my part."""
__label__pos	Great for little hands
__label__neg	 He doesn't even try anymore
__label__pos	"""I loved this!"""
__label__neu	The Dr. Brown's bottles do fit the Medela pump connectors.
__label__neg	It has drawbacks though.
__label__pos	Just kidding SMILEY.
__label__neu	Well I did and I am completly satisfied.
__label__neu	Hopefully, it will still work when the diapers get REALLY smelly! 
__label__neu	This thing has a few  major flaws
__label__neu	So if you ignore that feature it's a great design.
__label__neg	"""if you want to continue using the carrier past 3 months, I would suggest looking at the more expensive Baby Bjorn for comfort..."""
__label__pos	Plus, unlike a bottle warmer appliance, there are no moving part or electrical components to wear out or break, so we expect we'll be using ours for years/babies to come.
__label__neg	Turned out to be a 20 buck paperweight for me.
__label__neg	When it works it is fine, but the stupid inner funnel ring has broken and had to be replaced 3 times already. 
__label__pos	"""It was very easy to install."""
__label__pos	ventilated shells protect irritated or damaged nipples from contact with clothing reducing irritation and allowing healing without blocking air from the skin- ventilated shells can collect a couple ounces of milk (if you're mindful of the holes at the top)- solid (no hole) shells can collect 2-3 ounces of milk and have convenient pouring spouts- base is shaped pointing out which is desirable for flat nipplesCons.
__label__neu	There I was trying to get ready for my baby -- due any day -- and I'm dealing with a box sent with zero padding,  and a seller who told me that if I opened it,  they wouldn't take it back.
__label__neg	I would have returned it if I didn't need it right away as a back up crib sheet.
__label__neg	 Overall, this was just OK as an infant tub, but no good for bigger babies
__label__pos	We brought our baby home from the hospital yesterday and hooked up the monitors - they worked great
__label__pos	Definitely a cute toy that I'm sure that he'll enjoy more when he's a bit older.
__label__neu	The mirror is the only part he seems interested in and it only entertains him for a few minutes.
__label__neu	"""My husband still could use it till the babies hit about 15lbs, but this time around, we just went for the baby bjorn."""
__label__neu	).
__label__neg	 It's so not worth it
__label__neu	"""These are a 1 for 1 replacement of the parts that came with the pump."""
__label__pos	Our son absolutely LOVES this play gym.
__label__pos	I highly recommend this for babies learning to use sippy cup.
__label__pos	I like this video monitor, it has good sound and good video.
__label__pos	We love this.
__label__neg	I REGRET of spending my money in this
__label__neg	 It is not worth $200.
__label__neg	"""I don't know about you, but it's a bit annoying to have to go over to the swing all the time to hit the button repeatedly..."""
__label__pos	Also great for bad backs as it really distributes the weight.
__label__neu	The remote did not work unless it was within a few inches of the mirror.
__label__pos	It is definitely the best swing on the market with all of its bells and whistles, stability, versatility, and even looks.
__label__neg	This bumper has not even been used since it never was able to hold in air due to it being defective
__label__neu	It is horrible.
__label__neu	Bad idea!
__label__neg	Young babies need more support than this model can give.
__label__neg	 the one she bought is a piece of crap, after trying to put it up for 10 minutes, and it still isnt secure
__label__pos	I found the pumping mechanism very comfortable even when my nipples were very sore from initial breastfeeding.
__label__neg	until you get used to it)  It didn't contain the smell well at all
__label__neu	Yes these pads are thicker than most.
__label__neu	I've had it for about 3 months and I haven't had any problems so far
__label__pos	 this folding seat may be appealing to little ones because it comes decorated with familiar characters (e
__label__neu	Made of sturdy plastic and mesh, with strong suction cups.  
__label__pos	"""The flip action is so easy to use that even your toddler (or your foot) can do it to make diapers and smell disapper."""
__label__pos	Great functionality!
__label__pos	But for just using this soother on the crib its great.
__label__neg	 But it still is falling apart. 
__label__pos	"I like that the pump itself is very small and you can put it in any bag, though this bag is nice and doesn't scream ""BREASTPUMP!!!"""
__label__neu	Reading the other reviews I guess I was not the only one with the same problem
__label__pos	When I got it I was very pleased with the colors.
__label__pos	"""The sling feature is wonderful for when your little one is still a little one."""
__label__pos	We are really pleased with this cute toy.
__label__neu	I thought that he would have to turn sideways to get through the door and would not like it once used on a regular basis.
__label__neu	A cup or washcloth will do the trick.
__label__neu	Plus, your hands are free when you don't have to hold them.
__label__neu	"""You may reduce interference if your monitor lets you switch to a different channel within its frequency band."""
__label__neg	 Just last week I looked over at her and her head was hanging over the side while her feet were still on the bouncer. 
__label__neu	A video monitor would have suited us more to see if she has squirmed herself into the corner of the crib or just protesting sleep.
__label__neg	Not happy but didn't want the hassle of an exchange
__label__neu	Secondly, there is a weird contour of the pillow that pokes right at your stomach. 
__label__pos	"""Other than that this is definitely a great product; it holds an entire carton of gerber's stage 2 bb food!"""
__label__neu	She wants one like mommies!
__label__pos	I was psyched when I saw this bib maybe I could keep this one on her?
__label__neg	Often times the fruit would be too small and it moves around in the net too much and hard for the baby to eat it or the fruit would be too large and it won't fit into the net.
__label__neu	Bought this for our daughter when she was four months old and in the 25th percentile for height and weight
__label__neg	 In the beginning, I would spend a lot of time trying to get the boppy comfortable around me and in place before someone handed me my daughter during feeding times. 
__label__neg	I purchased this item because I thought it would be better than the cheep drugstore bottle/sippy cup holders.
__label__pos	We kept using it & at 4 months, he said we didn't even need to worry about it anymore.
__label__neg	They are very hard to squeeze anyway so not much fun
__label__neu	It's a great idea, but just didn't pan out.
__label__neg	It's not very sturdy and the drop rail is a joke
__label__pos	It fits snugly onto the chair so I am not worried about it falling off or tipping over.
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	the wood is a dream to touch. 
__label__pos	We were so happy with this product that we purchased another package within the first few days that we used them.
__label__neg	 So, ultimately, I'm going to end up using these for water and buying more of the others for everything else
__label__pos	even at 2yo my boys are too old to use the stage #1 training bridge but they love using chopsticks just like mommy and daddy and have gotten quite good at feeding themselves bite- size bits of chicken and sticky rice.
__label__neu	 But neither has my Lansinoh bag.
__label__neg	 My daughter just turned 4 months and she is 15 pounds already
__label__pos	 These wrap around the edge of the table and cover more area than the previously reviewed brand
__label__pos	I love to look at it too!
__label__neg	 When the cover is on a spigot, the back of the cover won't meet the tile wall, which means it can't be caulked into place, which means it is easily bumped out of position, spewing water everywhere, or perhaps worse, falling off the spigot entirely
__label__pos	"""Most of all: NO SMELL."""
__label__neg	I would not buy it again, thats for sure.
__label__neg	So,  you still have the electrical hazard as well as a choking hazard
__label__neg	I wish I had gone with a more expensive diaper pail because I can't take the odor.
__label__neu	Something that fit the spout well (like this one does),  that stays clean inside (like this one),  that works with a shower diverter knob (like this one does
__label__neu	Well... 
__label__neg	I never wonder if enough time had passed since feeding or changing or napping--it doesn't matter how much time has passed when your baby lets you know he is wet or hungry or sleepy!
__label__neg	my poor nipples were purple even after few minutes of pumping.
__label__neg	Save your money.
__label__neg	 My advice is save your money and buy something your baby REALLY needs.
__label__neg	It leaves no room for fingers to get pinched either.
__label__neg	 Don't waste your money when other companies offer the same BPA free products for a fraction of the price
__label__neg	"""No static."""
__label__pos	i got this for a co-worker who was having a baby boy - she used it a lot for swaddling his first few months and really liked it. 
__label__neu	I loved this pillow while I was pregnant.
__label__neg	"She said it was a ""good little lightweight pump,  and affordable"" --- well,  I don't think [$$] for a manual plastic unit that hurts your wrist and breaks after 5 weeks of regular use should be considered ""good"
__label__pos	Let me just say it has been wonderful!! Ever since he was born, our baby has kept snuggly warm when being transported from car to house and anywhere else we brought him in the car seat. 
__label__neu	The diaper dekor plus now is oval and the inner lid is square.
__label__neg	Spend the money on a munchkin bottle brush ....
__label__neu	 I'm going to be replacing it with the Jolly Jumper caddy.
__label__pos	So - not just for kids :o)
__label__pos	"""Like all Lamaze toys, it's well designed and well made."""
__label__neg	 We had to put kidco locks on the top to keep the top from opening and another lock on the door, because when we would open it, it would come out of it's holders. 
__label__neu	Now she can throw it around and squish the flowers.
__label__pos	We're using the fleece at night in the winter, the quilt during the day in winter and we used the cotton one in the Fall.
__label__neu	Whenever baby is fussy and doesn't necessarily want to be held, I can put him in this, and he calms right down.  
__label__neg	My only complaint is that on even the lowest setting my daughter can't reach the floor with her feet right now
__label__neu	Snoogle's ONE cover opening is in a very awkward location.
__label__pos	That aside, the pack n play is great. 
__label__pos	I also have a formula dispenser that I got at WalMart (Parent's Choice brand), and that one works well also, but doesn't hold the full 8 oz.
__label__neg	"do not buy this potty chair simply for the ""bells and whistles""  they never seem to work at the right time - or at all half of the time"
__label__neg	Plus the bottom of the soother is not flat which is another stupid thing.
__label__pos	I bought this bib after a lot of recommendations. 
__label__neg	 This would be great for a quick outting to the super market but definitely not good for a long day out with the baby
__label__pos	Ears are a nice size for smaller mouths to nibble on. 
__label__neg	 Nope, same thing
__label__neg	My 10-month old always falls to the side of the chair and the tray is too high on her chest (she's average height and has been sitting up for months). 
__label__neu	The only time i was happy with it was once he was old enough to sit in the full tub which is when this isn't needed
__label__pos	Every kid that comes over hops on it and goes for a ride.
__label__pos	And it is oh so cute as well!
__label__neu	I freaked & ran to our local BRU that same day.
__label__neu	I then just used the trick that they did in the hospital and rolled up a couple of baby blankets and placed one on each side of him.  
__label__neg	He doesn't care
__label__neg	"""My son only used this a handful of times."""
__label__pos	It fits nicely in the kitchen sink as well.
__label__neu	We have the matching ocean wonders bathroom space saver as well.  
__label__neu	"Note: it only fits on the ""front"" of a changing table or play yard (the attachment arm/hook is not wide enough to hang from the sides)."
__label__pos	I can even pick my toddler up while the baby is in the wrap...
__label__neu	"""I use the Munchkin fold up drying rack too."""
__label__pos	"""I didn't want to blow off another $100 bucks on monitor so I tried this one for $29.99."""
__label__pos	 I got Sure Comfort Deluxe instead. 
__label__neu	Much less expense option and works the same as this system!
__label__pos	Its very adaptable with three different speeds (for different ages/stages), upright and laid back seating positions as well as three way turning.
__label__neu	Now we broke it in two pieces to fence off certain areas but in a few more weeks when she is strong enough to climb on it,  it will be completely useless.
__label__neu	"""Once the twins outgrew the play area, we used the fencing to wall off the entertainment center and shelves in the livingroom and kitchen so that they could play in the entire area and we could still keep them (and out stuff) safe."""
__label__neg	 It also ripped right on the inside of the curve where my shoulder hit it
__label__neu	This holds the soothie, but so will any other paci clip with a string loop at the end, like the booginhead one (nothing special there).
__label__pos	"""we lost our first one at the zoo and just bought a second."""
__label__pos	There are a number of colorful toys on it that my daughter really enjoys,  including the music and sounds
__label__neg	The worst thing is the horrible smell it gives off.
__label__neg	 I never complain about assembling toys, gadgets, playards, etc...but this thing is horrible. 
__label__neu	We ended up just buying small cd/radio players for each of their room because this is something they can both use for a long time.
__label__pos	If you have ever been somewhere with your child and didn't want to lug your entire diaper bag into a public bathroom stall this is the product for you!
__label__neu	I bought one of these and one of another brand and put one in each car.
__label__pos	Fortunately Babies R Us will allow you to exchange the damaged item if it has been 90 days or less.
__label__pos	This works great.
__label__neu	The bottles were either too hot or too cold.
__label__neu	That's right-- it's cute to look at for a little boy, which is why we put it on our registry. 
__label__pos	This tub is just the best! 
__label__pos	The chair is easy to clean and it looks cute attached to one of our dining chairs.
__label__neg	this didnt keep snacks from being all over the place
__label__neg	"""The only thing that I was disappointed about is that the changing pad has a stain on it (it's underneath the plastic)."""
__label__neg	Before it did,  I could only get an ounce out at a time if I was lucky.
__label__neg	- from using it three times I could tell it was going to breed some awful mildew & soap residue that was going to be a pain to clean- and while the bubble bath dispenser is a cool idea
__label__neu	I tried to use it for 3 months... 
__label__pos	I highly recommend this wonderful booster!
__label__neg	2. Nipple TOO soft & too long...
__label__pos	perfect
__label__neu	We have the carpet covered baseboards and then a chair-rail like trim
__label__neg	 I agree with one of the other comments regarding a slit for the safety strap
__label__pos	"""I used it when my son was a newborn to carry him around the house - it gave me back my mobility since I could carry him around and do things such as make my own breakfast and eat!"""
__label__pos	She's got beautiful eyes, a neat ring with little bugs to jiggle around and a handful of fun, crinkley flowers.
__label__neg	"""The Skip Hop diaper changing pad was a little too big and bulky to fit nicely in the outside pocket that I believe is made for that."""
__label__pos	It is comfortable enough to wear without the baby in too so you can put it on once for the day even if you put the baby in and out.
__label__pos	Overall I love this mobile.
__label__pos	Also fits on the Prince Lionheart diaper depot.
__label__pos	However, I would still not recommend any other tub but this one.
__label__neu	I am a RN and quite used to giving baths in different settings so it is not inexperience talking here.
__label__pos	If you have others to choose from don't pick another.
__label__neu	A lactation consultant suggested I try a larger breastshield.
__label__neg	Another issue is the magnet 'key' which I wouldn't have known to order had I not read it in a previous review.
__label__pos	During her first week she was really fussy and this chair calmed her down almost every time now she even sleeps in it for 2-3 hours.
__label__neg	This toy ois designed for a child who is ready to track and grab, but the toys are out of reach. 
__label__pos	"""It has different height adjustments which is a must since she is already 25 inches."""
__label__neu	I HATE IT!!!
__label__neu	It gives her the option to touch her feet down but still gives her the support to sit up on her own.
__label__neg	It requires some assembly.
__label__pos	"I prefer the ""real"" carriers though."
__label__pos	I think this gift along with the sleep sheep by the same company are wonderful!
__label__neg	It also does pathetically little to keep the smell down
__label__neu	Your story may be different.
__label__pos	Then I tried Lansanoh pads, both super absorbant & ultra thin, and loved them both.
__label__neg	Halo needs to get their sizing in line with standard clothing sizing for babies and they need to offer a smaller size in this item. 
__label__neu	every baby is different) and he has spit up only twice.
__label__pos	The basket inside is removeable and makes it easy to pull out 2.5 ounce baby food jars.  
__label__neu	These ones have NO BUBBLES!
__label__pos	I was recommended this by a fellow mom before we had our daughter and purchased it from Baby's R Us.
__label__neu	Nice night light3 color options (altho 1 doens't work)Has a timer so you don't have to worry about shutting off laterLooks cuteCons
__label__neu	Then I realized that the nipple doesn't just have a hole in it like other bottles do
__label__neu	I use platex nurser with the disposable liners,  and when I tried to heat it in the warmer sometimes it would be cold other times it would get so warm that the liner would leak.
__label__pos	My son didn't want to switch to the Stage 3 until he was almost 8 months old - so I'd try them out before I plunged.
__label__neg	I have been using this mirror for about a month and a half
__label__neu	I love that these are made with safer materials but beware that they absolutely leak! 
__label__neu	"""I don't breastfeed, so I really don't use it as much as other people probably do."""
__label__pos	Putting baby in teh car now takes about two seconds.
__label__pos	I love this item.
__label__pos	She can keep warm and see that her feet are still there.  
__label__neg	Hope Fisher Price reads these reviews.
__label__neu	The remote with very fresh batteries will turn the music on,  but you have to shut it off manually.
__label__pos	WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!
__label__pos	The vibration is a life saver because our daughter likes constant movement. 
__label__neu	LOVE IT!!!!!  From day one my son had a great time in his new (huge) tub.
__label__pos	It is quick and easy.
__label__pos	The Gerber bags with the zip lock design are much more economical and are leak proof.
__label__neu	I THINK MY DAUGHTER IS TOO SMALL
__label__neu	Then they said only half the MSRP with me paying shipping. 
__label__neu	This never happened with the other bags on the market.
__label__pos	The sling feature has really come in handy (especially for newborns) in giving my infant a bath.
__label__neg	 It's awful
__label__neu	We bought this frog pod and put it in our little girl's bathroom
__label__neg	 But this never seemed to work the same way twice
__label__pos	Great Animal Bedding
__label__neg	Unless you have 20 minutes to kill while your baby is screaming for a bottle,  you don't want this
__label__pos	These are so great especially at times of daddy-changing-the-baby-when-pooped.
__label__neu	then,  i was at babies r us and those yellow things cost as much as a fully assembled cone,  so i just bought the fully assembled cones
__label__neu	If the receiver is set for the video picture to remain on continuously,  the battery lasts for less than 10 minutes.
__label__neg	Sometimes it would slide up or down and just wasn't long enough for him (and my guy is a short guy!).  
__label__neu	My son is one big ball of gas.
__label__pos	With my first, I had to give her first baths (until her umbilical cord fell off) on her changing table- but with this tub, the hammock is great! 
__label__neu	shields are very soft. 
__label__neg	Even the newborn nipples are WAAAAAY too long for a newborn's mouth ( and my baby has a BIG mouth
__label__pos	The covers and pillows are washable although I haven't washed the pillow yet i have washed the covers several times and they are holding up great.
__label__pos	Although Im only 6 months pregnant I know this gate is going to work out great for our dogs when our baby is here.  
__label__neg	"""Also make sure not to overfill them or they will leak."""
__label__neg	Though you still will need warm hat and scarf too keep your baby warm.
__label__neg	 They're useless. 
__label__neg	I duck- taped it for a while but that makes it kind of hard to put the baby in or take it out!
__label__neg	!UPDATE:Discontinued use after calcium deposits and slight odor.
__label__neg	It pilled up with the wash and dry{tumble low}
__label__neg	 Pass on these
__label__pos	Good luck whatever you decide.
__label__neg	Also, I bought one of these for my son before I knew Nuby's abysmal BPA record and campaign of misinformation to consumers
__label__neu	Then, if you have a vaginal birth.
__label__neu	I'm taking it back & getting the Neat again!
__label__neu	I have contacted Sassy so hopefully they will do something about it
__label__neg	But there are 2 minor things I found.1.
__label__neu	It took me 2 months to fully recover.
__label__neu	I can't say enough about the Diaper Dekor Plus system.  
__label__neu	However, our son isn't extremely squirmy so we don't use the straps anyways. 
__label__neu	They want a crib number,  even though we know the crib name and can locate the crib on their web site by name and it has no number
__label__neu	We had a plastic mat underneath our high chair for the first two years for our daughter...  
__label__pos	I highly recommend freddie the firefly by lamaze instead.
__label__neu	Then I mixed it up with a spoon to make sure there are no cold spots, test it and put the liner into the bottle and feed my baby.
__label__neu	"""I absolutely love this chair."""
__label__neu	"""If you are using these with a breastfed baby, you don't need the Stage 2 nipples (breastmilk doesn't flow faster, so the nipples don't need to be changed)."""
__label__neu	 Dr
__label__pos	It has a clock, a light, a backlight to see the numbers in the dark, and even a little reminder at the bottom for which side you last breastfed from.
__label__pos	Two years later it has been used so many times I can't even count.
__label__pos	The canvas seems to wash up well.
__label__pos	I have been using those bottles and nipples ever since,  and she is doing great when i need to switch from breast to bottle
__label__neg	That being said I wish I had just paid a little less and got the model without the shower.
__label__pos	"""I am giving these as a gift along with the matching diapers - they look like really good covers."""
__label__neg	I bought initially for the carseat on the road,  (can't have the bar up while driving) but it wouldn't clip on to the carseat
__label__neg	"""Sweeter music would be better."""
__label__pos	This saved me!
__label__neu	We usually give her other/additional toys to play with and there is open tray space to set those on
__label__neu	We've had it for a week now and I still haven't found my little screwdriver to check out the electronic features.  
__label__neu	"""I bought this for my first son three years ago."""
__label__neg	 I talked to a lactation consultant and found that the Boppy was NEVER designed to be a nursing pillow. 
__label__neg	 Second of all it is not at all powerful
__label__neg	Or, the cow needs to have a face on both sides!
__label__neg	No thanks. 
__label__pos	But these Kidco Lock Set is so easy
__label__neg	Next time I will rather go than for a special backpack for normal backpack with all life warranty and buy changing pad for it.
__label__neu	 It has a wonderful voice activated only feature that allows perfect silence from the monitor unless baby is fussing (i
__label__neu	I ordered the larger one in the cotton version.
__label__pos	My baby loves this bouncer.  
__label__pos	My car sits in the hot sun all day at the train station, but the car seat is kept cool thanks to this shade.  
__label__pos	Fairly easy to put together.  
__label__pos	"""A great buy!"""
__label__pos	I bought this because it looked like a more comfortable version of the tub sponge that my mom recommended
__label__neg	This pump is NOT BPA-free
__label__pos	This is the ultimate play gym,  and I highly recommend it
__label__neu	You Avent users might like the wide neck Dr Browns also b/c they are easy to clean and pour milk into like the Avents,  there are more parts but so worth it to releive colic.
__label__neu	It barks when you push on the nose. 
__label__neg	 The boppy is collecting dust. 
__label__neg	Err!
__label__neg	Does NOT stay up on all kinds of tile
__label__neu	In truth,  in my 6 years of parenting,  I have found only 2 that have not leaked
__label__pos	"""I used a friends electric pump (don't remember what brand it was) and a piece broke so I decided that buying a manual pump was fine since I only pumped to have some milk on hand for a babysitter if we went on a date or left the baby with his grandparents for any amount of time."""
__label__neu	This is very misleading.
__label__pos	They're also great for attaching toys to the stroller, car seat, etc.
__label__neu	(**** You just have to have to correct collar/ nipple combination* ***) the yellow lids also only fit the old style nipples and collars.
__label__neu	First and foremost,  it is a pain in
__label__neg	"""I thought I had wasted my money on this thing."""
__label__pos	This isn't a necessary item, but it's definitely something worthwhile to have!
__label__neu	 There are 2 channels
__label__pos	Our son's gas IMMEDIATELY disappeared and he no longer suffered from nipple confusion.
__label__neg	This was one of three diaper pails I tried while my daughter was in diapers, and my least favorite of the three. 
__label__neg	I have been trying to like this thing for 7 months, but I have given up.
__label__neg	My 11 month old loves these (and has since she could first grab) but they do not work like they are designed
__label__pos	I was able to put it together :) must have a philps screwdriver.
__label__neu	In many ways I feel as though I am pregnant again
__label__neu	I would recommend that number
__label__neg	 Also the price they are charging here is too high
__label__neg	also you have to worry about the black mold/mildew that collects when you have bath toys like this
__label__pos	great sterilizer for everything!
__label__neu	And like another reviewer said
__label__neu	Wouldn't buy them again.
__label__neu	"And the extra storage just didn't provide much ""storage""."
__label__pos	it is larger than you think it would be. 
__label__neu	Its not worth the money spent,  in my opinion.
__label__neu	"""I put my sons pacifiers & spoons in the top tray."""
__label__neu	Anyway my now nearly 6 month old loves grabbing things and after a night episode where he wrapped the blanket around his face twice the next day I was at babiesrus to check the Halo sleepsacks out.
__label__neg	This is the worst thing ever
__label__neu	"""I received the GRACO dual receivers as a baby shower gift."""
__label__pos	"""This is a wonderful product."""
__label__pos	" We used them throughout her ""bottle-hood""--for over a year"
__label__neg	I thought it was very difficult to use
__label__neu	I'm sorry I didn't at least register for a pack of these when I was pregnant.
__label__neu	That opinion changed quickly after the first night I had to wake up to change diapers.
__label__pos	I am usually very sensitive about any bad smells, and so is my mom but even she couldnt smell any odors. 
__label__neg	It's vinyl and therefore is uncomfortable on his skin and is hot (we live in Florida).  
__label__neu	There are several models (though none via Amazon, that I see) that rock, including one we found that's inflatable - it holds thrice the water of the infant bath but still a small fraction of what's needed in the entire tub. 
__label__neg	" The fronts of the drawers measure almost 9"", but the insides are only 3-1/2"" deep"
__label__neu	My wife keeps buying Fisher-Price products for our infant.
__label__neu	My son was not comfortable in the carrier either.
__label__pos	This saves a lot of time.
__label__neg	However,  that causes him to slide down the sling and it's quite hard where the sling ends,  so he ends up with this red mark on his lower back.
__label__neu	I seriously considered comments and reviews when deciding which items I wanted, which I could live without, and what was an absolute must have.
__label__pos	My sons are at the age where we are transitioning them from sippy cups to regular cups and these are perfect for that in-between stage.
__label__neu	sexy, huh?
__label__neu	(We wanted the sage color to match our nursery decor.)
__label__pos	The handles are nice and wide to fit her chunky hands and they can handle the abuse she dishes out by banging it on every surface she can find.  
__label__neg	It looked very uncomfortable.
__label__pos	"""Even ordered an addiotional one for my grandparents house that we are going to in the next week in another state!"""
__label__pos	Its all great!
__label__pos	It is also more comfortable when sitting in a chair with arm rests.
__label__neu	If your child moves around in the bed and you don't have this positioned exactly where they are they will miss.  
__label__pos	:-)
__label__neg	Just frustrating that the travel case isn't holding up.
__label__neu	"""So many people are against that but as long as you shake up the bottle before you feed the baby there's no problem."""
__label__pos	"""She stood in it and played with the toys at each spot - learned to walk and then to run around it."""
__label__pos	My sister raves about her Ocean Wonders Cradle Swing.
__label__neu	"""other than that..."""
__label__pos	It's virtually odor free (though not always!) and sturdy.  
__label__neu	I couldn't get my baby to latch at all during first 24 hrs of birth. 
__label__neg	 And they are just as tricky to get apart
__label__pos	"""Machine washable, and dry quickly when hung."""
__label__neu	We bought this swing for our son when he was 2 months old.
__label__pos	I never had a problem sleeping.
__label__neg	However,  when we first started using it with baby,  we noticed that it began to say the wrong color associated with the wrong foot
__label__neg	 well 2 weeks into using them i threw them out the window
__label__neu	The product I received is not the one pictured. 
__label__neu	The Avent pads are thick and smaller and they show through your shirt.
__label__neu	My husband and I had to take a few minutes to get it down but after the first two or three times using it I didn't have to use the directions anymore.
__label__neu	I did not register for this but bought it after my son was born. 
__label__pos	I think this is even better than the original (2001) fisher price aquarium since the image on the ceiling is better and the birds are so cute.
__label__pos	I actually used this with my Pack N Play and loved the handy organizer features.
__label__pos	My baby falls asleep all the time on it.
__label__neg	I am throwing this out and buying something else. 
__label__neu	She's had this since birth and has just shown an interest in it in the past month or two.
__label__neu	 Trust the reviews. 
__label__pos	"""The manual suggests an arrangement that will hold 4 bottles, 4 nipples, 4 screw on collars, and 4 lids, and that works out well, even with Avent."""
__label__neg	" Our kids did like to mimic Mommy and Daddy using utensils, and they would practice ""eating"" with these, but they could have done just as well with a regular baby spoon"
__label__neu	The first time I used this warmer I was very careful how I placed it in my diaper bag and I was also very careful not to bump my diaper bag.  
__label__pos	It is definitely worth the price.
__label__neu	"I couldnt breastfeed but my son only really likes ""dome"" type nipples"
__label__neg	Many times I have been sprayed by an improperly fitting nipple.
__label__neu	My son has to actually do something with this toy rather than listen to it and watch some lights flash.
__label__neu	Also,  you need two hands to open the lock- one to push the button in and one to move the lock back
__label__pos	"""It doesn't leak!"""
__label__pos	"He does in fact like to be swaddled  basic 36""x36"" cotton flannel receiving blankets work much better for us.I will say this swaddler is easier to wrap than a blanket."
__label__neg	"""Anyways, after buying the Genie, I bought the champ and I am perfectly happy with it."""
__label__neu	If your dvd player is less than 2.
__label__neg	"""It is pretty much like a big tupperware container that you put bottles in and then put in the microwave to sterilize."""
__label__neu	its made out of partical board about 1/4 inch think
__label__neg	 I am using them but am not fussed on how long they last or what happens to them, I won't be buying any more though. 
__label__neg	 IT keeps doing this until the bag is too heavy and wont wrap at all
__label__pos	I own this one,  but my mom bought one for her house that has so many better features
__label__neg	 The space for the cord is so small, you have to be very precise about where you place the cord
__label__neg	The spots disappear in warm water about 70
__label__neu	I regret waiting at all.
__label__neg	 Here I go with the stupid MANUEL pump
__label__pos	 Get the cute little squirt duckies instead
__label__neu	One note, sometimes you have to adjust the cover a bit or the vibrating box rattles, and DO NOT try to move it once baby is in it - the wire frame is not balanced at all except when on the ground.
__label__pos	After he was old enough to pull it that they say to not have mobiles anymore, I took the whole toy apart and we played with all it's pieces and the music box separately for many months.
__label__neu	it's the supplier's issue.
__label__pos	Speedy way to sterilize
__label__neg	turns out,  this thing is a piece of junk
__label__pos	It's perfect; however, the amber lights are barely visible - even when the room is completely dark.
__label__neg	What a nuisance!
__label__pos	It's truly one of the best toys I've ever bought her, we're getting the smaller one for our 1 year old as well.
__label__pos	 It was a little cheaper in price and it has a lid lock that the other didn't have. 
__label__neg	I gave up after a few weeks and just took the unit off the organizer, and super-glued a regular wipe container on top of the organizer, that I just keep buying refills for.
__label__neg	 My husband and I are very happy with the safety and comfort features of the Eddie Bauer system
__label__pos	I like that it has a separate bowl and my daughter is so proud when she can take it out and flush it down the big potty.
__label__neg	"""Just be careful on cheap cabinets because you can drill through the entire door!"""
__label__neu	Additionally, if any of the Dr. Brown's bottles are not assembled correctly and the collar isn't on tight enough they will leak. 
__label__pos	The comforter is light but is quite warm, even for my daughter, whose bed is near a window.
__label__neu	Well,  my son got a lot of air with these bottles and did not like the nipples.
__label__neg	I use it only occasionally and it drives me crazy even than. 
__label__neu	Please be warned that if it even seems like your child can push off the table with this chair do not use it.
__label__neu	Diaper Champ vs.
__label__neu	At 2 months, our baby's head was getting awfully flat.
__label__neu	The last thing you need is to have to put everything down to check a bottle constantly
__label__neg	But I wish it were longer so it sat beneath the highchair tray.
__label__neg	First, the pocket is pretty much useless. 
__label__pos	I've used 2 of them for 2 months for cloth diapers and they are holding up well.
__label__pos	But it works perfectly now
__label__pos	"""Also the cushion looks very nice."""
__label__neu	A washcloth works better since it gets held on by his legs.  
__label__pos	"""Perfect for when baby starts to get tired of their hands and feet as toys!"""
__label__neg	"""Using any cellphone with 15 feet of either the monitor or the receiver creates a horrible interference noise."""
__label__pos	The best tip that I got when I was pregnant was to get a Boppy.
__label__neu	Our dining area is fairly small so using our existing dining chair does save space.
__label__neu	If we touch it, the static seems to decrease.
__label__neg	This would have been OK if you could buy replacement spouts as Its most likely a phase but I can't find them ANYWHERE so I had to buy entire replacement bottles.
__label__neg	"One thing--the ""toys"" are silly plastic junk, I threw them away immediately. "
__label__pos	The re-sealable bags for the Steribottles are easy to use and do help keep them clean.
__label__neg	I really didn't want something with a light in it, but didn't have a choice.
__label__neu	I found that the bottom wipe does turn brown but only when I keep adding the fresh wipes to the top and the bottom ones were older.
__label__neg	Only complain, baby outgrew it.
__label__neg	This swing does not recline,  so if your baby cannot completely sit up on their own,  they slump down or tip to the side
__label__neg	Just pushing her booster up to the table wasn't good enough.
__label__neu	Number that would make you sick: 1.
__label__neu	Like I said the idea of the VentAire is good but the bottles just aren't up to my expectations.
__label__neg	"""Do not buy this."""
__label__neu	"""also..."""
__label__pos	She laughs continously when I turn this on.
__label__pos	My one year old son and I share a shower/bathtub. 
__label__neg	I will definitely read the reviews first this time!!
__label__neu	We've had it over a month,  I highly recommend the Eurobath over this bath tub.
__label__neg	Not only do they turn yellow they dry out
__label__neg	The lock is necessary because in this model the odors linger if you don't lock it, hence it is not hands free as it is supposed to be.
__label__neu	00 less weighted down by cash,  and I was on my way with what was the most expensive non-video monitor available at the local Target.
__label__neg	I frequently just couldn't seem to get the bags to completely seal - and I had NEVER had this problem with the Gerber bags
__label__pos	Replace your outlet covers with this simple but effective child- proof plate - just slide to use.
__label__pos	But it isn't, and doesn't, and took literally seconds to snap onto the gate.
__label__pos	This is the greatest thing that you can get!
__label__neu	She sleeps from 10 pm until 5 or 6 am! I couldn't find it the other day and had to use Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe blanket I had and she wasn't too happy about it. 
__label__neg	)Also, the quality of the liners is pretty shabby... Expect the seams on the liners to be frayed, uneven, and single-stitched.
__label__neg	 I put my old car mirror back up & just gave up on this product. 
__label__neu	"""The valves get slippery when washing so I'd recommend a extra set of those as we've lost one down the disposal..."""
__label__pos	We love it!
__label__neu	In short,  a very good gate for keeping kids out of a certain room
__label__neu	I placed my daughter on the colorful mat with her feet on the bar.
__label__pos	There is also a line called Daisy Gear which offers a similar line of products as well as some as the same.. just to let anyone know.I LOVE THIS BACPACK!
__label__neg	 My daughter was used to the Dr
__label__neu	Keep searching for another set
__label__neg	 There is a hard plastic honey comb underneath it and hard plastic surrounding it that force you to put your elbows into two tiny areas or risk severe pain from the plastic. 
__label__neu	okay gate
__label__neg	The VentAire sounded great but I am very disappointed and caution everyone who decides to use them.
__label__neg	This was terrible. 
__label__neu	My girlfriend said she and her husband have taken it apart and tried everything to improve upon the shower,  but they have had little success with it too.
__label__pos	Even though my 1 year old likes it, my 4 year old loves it even more.  
__label__neu	Really.
__label__pos	If I had ten hands I'd give it (10) thumbs up
__label__neg	"One downfall - have plenty of size ""D"" batteries handy."
__label__pos	They work better as cloth wipes than they do as blankets.
__label__neg	 I have several and have been using them since my son was born four months ago
__label__neg	 About a week ago--the mirror started to (what I thought was)fog
__label__neg	The only reason I gave it two stars is because the pattern is very nice.
__label__neu	The springs have been popping off since about the first month.
__label__neg	She's not a big fan of her car seat, and despite being now 10 lbs and 24 inches, she's still a bit small to enjoy her Fisher Price vibrating chair/rocker--it reclines too much, and is a bit wide, so she slumps.
__label__neu	So if at all possible I would advise borrowing one from a friend to try out first to see if you can have any success before purchasing this pump.
__label__neg	I can't comment on how the item works since we weren't able to gain access to the battery compartment
__label__pos	Our son loves his bed.
__label__neu	It has lots of adjustment at the neckline.
__label__neu	If you're debating between the Sony and Fisher-Price monitors,  definitely opt for the Fisher-Price.
__label__pos	Originally, I had purchased a boppy covered in cotton patterned fabric.
__label__neg	The other person is right, it does not live up to the Boppy name.  
__label__pos	Try this and you will love it
__label__pos	I really wish we could have used this seat so hence the five stars.
__label__neg	I got these because of the one piece no leak lid.
__label__pos	"""We use it instead of a high chair (we put the straps around a chair we have at home) and feed our daughter in it."""
__label__pos	"""They fit little, chubby hands and keep my son's interest."""
__label__neu	The long flange of the plastic goes under the front legs of the DVD player and the short flange then covers the controls.
__label__pos	"""As a result I bring the Kooshies with me even on the go!"""
__label__neu	Works better in carseat than it does in our strollers (Kolcraft-due to straps in strollers), but it did keep our daughter super warm during Christmas in Park outing!
__label__pos	The picture and sound quality is decent on this camera.
__label__neu	they should have put one of those pads they have on the back part on the bottom also
__label__pos	These bottles worked great for us.
__label__pos	My milk supply was never huge so this was the only pump that allowed me to even get one bottle's worth of milk.I bought a cheaper one first but ended up wasting my money because it took forever to even get one ounce.
__label__pos	"""Now at 4 months old she's probably too big for it but we've been using it as a one-stop place for toys, diapers, ointments, burp cloths, etc."""
__label__neu	My boys are quite big for their age and they love to kick their legs and splash around.
__label__pos	I wanted something that didn't require batteries, but something that would require her attention and help develop her senses.She absolutely loves this mobile.
__label__neg	The idea behind the vent is great but what a pain to put together! 
__label__neu	I give them 3 stars for my son...
__label__neg	 We're switching to the diaper dekor, it actually works
__label__pos	A very good purchase...
__label__neg	I have to give two stars, though, since it was useless for us.
__label__neu	 Maybe the women who liked this pump had smaller nipples than I do
__label__neu	It might just be my protruding belly and waning strength though....
__label__pos	Easy to clean and basically I can put it anywhere.
__label__pos	"""It is great to have in the early days when you are dead tired and changing a poopy diaper every hour."""
__label__neu	"""For example, if you are going to put them in a bottle warmer, you MUST take the nipple off first or the liquid becomes piping hot and even explodes through the top."""
__label__neu	I figured I could use them when I was home.
__label__neg	It made my breasts hurt like they have never hurt before with any other pump Ive used in the past. 
__label__neg	my mother purchased this gate because she didnt want to put holes in the wall, and it is similar to the hardware mounted gate i own and love
__label__neg	so we are in an awkward transition phase
__label__neg	That is not the case. 
__label__neu	I cant imagine not being able to see my daughter at night if I hear her making noise.
__label__neg	Our little girl has the worst gas pains, but this waistband didn't help at all
__label__neu	Well, that figures.
__label__pos	"""thank you so much vulli!"""
__label__pos	I have a hard time getting my daughter out of the bath - she just loves being in there!
__label__neu	The gel gets super cold but the covering is very soft.
__label__pos	The headpiece needed a little adjustment but she doesn't slide in the chair and I feel really safe about letting her stay in it.
__label__neu	i'm taking mine out of the car today.
__label__neg	It was probably a great idea overall,  but I did not find any use for it
__label__pos	It's also so easy to operate that my baby figured out how to turn it on from about 3 months old.
__label__neg	The velcro that attaches to the mattress does keep the sheets snug, but getting the sheet off requires some force and can pull too [...] the seams of the bed.
__label__neg	 The blue spray nozzle doesn't really work
__label__pos	When our little one falls asleep in the car, it's easy to snap into the stroller, click her car seat on and go.
__label__pos	I bought 1 of these becasue my son used to use Avents
__label__neu	Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it would be nice to have a feature that allows the monitor to switch over to the room where noise is recognized.
__label__neg	1) Ridiculously expensive,  2) Fidgety extra parts that do nothing except require cleaning and slow you down when you try to fill it
__label__neg	Overall, a lot of fuss and we end up leaving them unlocked because they are a nuisance.
__label__neu	I am going to purchase the odor disks I just saw on amazon.
__label__neg	ALso, it takes SO MANY batteries, it's ridiculous.
__label__neg	Unstable and flimsy, this piece of plastic nonsense is such a disappointment
__label__pos	Excellent performance of the product, is fast, quiet, comfortable, spacious, included a number bottles and the pump all at once
__label__pos	"""The big velcro closures make it very easy to attach to the car seat, and to take it off as needed(good for this crazy weather we have!)"""
__label__neu	So, I buckled, and sent her daddy to by the Ultimate Wipes Warmer.
__label__neg	It continually splits from the wrong end, so every time the baby wakes up, she's come out of it.
__label__pos	This cover is so much easier to use than blankets. 
__label__pos	With all the others out there to choose from, this one is the best way to spend your $!
__label__neu	When my son is in bed, I will play music for him.  
__label__pos	"""Easy adjustable and have support for the baby head."""
__label__neu	The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are.
__label__pos	"""It's spacious and comfortable, he likes being in the water, other bathtubs have a seat out of the water."""
__label__neu	I recommend waiting to see if your little one wiggles out of the blanket and needs this before buying.
__label__neg	Like other reviewers have stated, the nipples on these bottles collapses and there are extra parts that seem useless, just more stuff to clean.
__label__neg	The plastic is thin and leaks in the freezer when frozen.
__label__pos	Well he's now 8- months old and he still loves it.
__label__pos	And she enjoyed it outside as well.
__label__pos	The size is perfect for toddler portions and storing bite-sized pieces of fruits and vegies, cereals, etc.
__label__neu	I felt it was worth it in the beginning to make sure my son didn't get collicky.
__label__neg	 This one literally STINKS
__label__neu	For additional [money] you get a few more extra items, all secured in elastic loops in a compact pouch.
__label__neu	Non-starter
__label__neg	 When it was all put together it didn't look like something I wanted to put my daughter on
__label__pos	Plus it's super easy to clean and has thermal properties.
__label__neu	My only complaint is that it is hard to get the pail open at first to change the bags but it gets easier over time as it loosens up and you get the hang of it!
__label__pos	The other cool thing is that all the toys are in one spot!
__label__neu	We use this toy all the time when we need to distract my son (ie in a doctor's office,  restaurant,  long car rides,  etc)
__label__neu	The other seven locks were installed in the kitchen and bathroom which have old cabinets. 
__label__neu	"""I first got BabyBjorn when my son was just a month."""
__label__neu	We just use the hottest water that comes out of the tap, and it is about 130 degrees F, the milk is warm in a few minutes even from frozen.
__label__neg	"""I was hesitant to use the bags because I was afraid they would leak so I found myself wanting to buy more bottles, but for $18.99 for 6, I needed to find another alternative."""
__label__neg	but now the person in the front passenger seat is too close to the dashboard
__label__neu	We bought our first set 7 years ago to use with our first child.
__label__neg	Stacking Medela bags in the freezer is difficult because of their shape...and thawing will be difficult because I can see I'll need to watch that the milk doesn't spill out the top. 
__label__neu	They are very hard plastic.
__label__neu	I've only washed it once but it does seem like the ends will fray very easily so I think when I do need to wash it I'll do so on a gentle cycle and let it air dry to help it last a little longer.
__label__pos	We give our daughter all sorts of foods in these cups (Cheerios, Veggie Booty, Cheddar Bunnies, etc) and the innovative lids really help keep the mess to a minimum.
__label__neg	They do not form with the breast and make your breast look weird when worn.
__label__neu	My baby doesn't need it anymore so now I use it as my neck pillow!
__label__neu	I, being a first time mom, wanted all the baby products out there! 
__label__pos	This swing is well designed in every way.
__label__neu	We recieved this as a gift for my one year old son after the original aquarium broke.  
__label__pos	We bought it off their registry as a gift, they love it.
__label__neu	We got this so that we could hear baby as she slept in her nursey and we worked elsewhere in the house and becasue we have always had wonderful expereince with everything Sony makes.
__label__pos	Great for travel.
__label__pos	I have since bought a Carter's cover and am much happier.
__label__neg	 I tried a few other bubble mixes and they didn't seem to make the bubbles as nicely. 
__label__neg	the rubber guard has become loose and doesn't adhere properly to the breast,  and the worst is that the neck has cracked on the pump causing milk to leak out
__label__pos	"This is important to me because I don't want ""liquid"" locked in between plastic and my skin."
__label__neu	After many leaks with these I switched to Lansinoh pads.
__label__neu	Definitely not for a 700 Sqr Foot apartment in the city.
__label__pos	Even my mom who use to work Labor and Delivery as a nurse loves this product.
__label__pos	They are soft, smooth, and I love that the flat sheet and comforter have one fitted end, which keeps the bedding on my daughter while she sleeps.
__label__pos	 Fortunately, we never had a problem with the Home Depot screws
__label__pos	"""We use Dr. Brown's Wide Neck bottles and they fit just fine (as long as we remember to remove the straw first, otherwise the milk rised out)."""
__label__pos	"""6)  Comes with extensions..."""
__label__neg	 The only thing my daughter really seems to like about it is the orange cup that has holes on the bottom
__label__neg	I was only a few pounds over that so I thought
__label__neu	I still found myself wanting to flip & could not do so without constantly waking my husband.
__label__neu	it might feel soft to touch but because baby has soft scalp,  it could easily rub too hard.
__label__neu	Nevertheless,  I was excited to try it out since my baby broke out of every swaddle
__label__pos	This is a great great item - one of the best we've found.
__label__pos	My son would not take naps in his crib but would nap for hours in this swing.
__label__neg	 I was wrong
__label__neu	I see no reason to switch.
__label__pos	This toy was just the cutest little thing, and I couldn't resist it
__label__neu	I have an unusual baseboard and my wall and banister are not aligned.
__label__neu	Use the stove or microwave
__label__pos	She simply loves it.
__label__pos	There are several levels to turn it up or down to unlike most noisy toys.
__label__pos	It actually helped me to relax too bc we slept in the same room. 
__label__pos	I really appeciate all of these things after dealing with the other brands.
__label__neu	at the head and foot of the sheet there are snaps that can come completely off.one elastic strap end snaps to the sheet then wraps around the crib rail and snaps back onto the sheet. 
__label__neg	My son hurt himself and complained for over 5 hours
__label__neu	It is also perplexing to find a place to sit this product AND allow the baby to actually see the designs that will show up on the ceiling/wall. 
__label__pos	This is just great!  
__label__pos	"""I ordered this for our 4 month old son and when it arrived I opened it up myself and didnt read the directions at first I got frustrated since I couldnt get it together then read them and voila it took me and a freind about 3 minutes to set it up!"""
__label__pos	My 6 month old son who is almost 20 pounds fits well in it, but I had to double wrap a bumper pad around it so he wouldn't roll into the cold metal!
__label__neg	They don't fit the pad very well regardless if it's laying flat for the playpen or if it's set up for the bassinet. 
__label__pos	When I decide to stop pumping I'll definitely give him these bottles exclusively.
__label__neu	90 inches wide, can be bunched up for narrower windows), fitted sheet, & diaper stacker.
__label__neu	I do not recommend buying this item.
__label__pos	 The square looking model was tacky looking to me so I was so happy to see this one now that I have a new baby  b/c I thought it looked similar to the original model. 
__label__pos	The feature that I loved the most was the baby hammock.
__label__pos	 would be nice if it worked.
__label__neg	 My baby slept much better when I stopped using this. 
__label__neu	We registered for this tub,  before doing any research.
__label__neu	They are a HUGE pain to use.
__label__neg	"We often get ""out-of-range"" beeps and static for no reason"
__label__pos	But for our newborn these bottles have been great.
__label__pos	well made and versitle.
__label__neu	right into her mouth and she went to town on it
__label__neg	The bowls are a good size, but if you're looking for something to stay put, these are not a good buy.
__label__pos	 Brown's smaller nipple was much better for my baby's tiny mouth
__label__neg	2) My baby is now 4 months old and doesn't fit as well into the tub so we may have to go to a different method sooner than planned.
__label__neu	My seat belt attaches at the bottom of my seat,  and this strap covers that--but I haven't determined if this is a problem or just a cosmetic issue
__label__neu	I was looking for a tub with an infant sling.
__label__neg	The old design has one main problem: That inner ring that used to be used to hold and twist the bag, which is softer plastic, rubs against the bag/refill package, which is harder plastic. 
__label__neu	We like to keep our lock on the metal frame by the kitchen window above the sink.
__label__pos	It is beautiful and is very easy to assemble.
__label__neu	 It's been a little over 3 weeks
__label__neg	Don't waste your money on Avent pads!
__label__pos	They don't just feel secure, they really are secure.I tried three other types of stools.
__label__neg	My daughter got bored with these toys FAST
__label__neg	"""The baby was so soft and I had a hard time to put him into the BabyBjorn by myself."""
__label__neu	This is my first big gripe.
__label__neg	OK, but we still have to remove the guard before each using of the player It's an annoyance.
__label__pos	I, too, have seen no problem with the seat belt laying funny, not sure what that one reviewer was talking about.
__label__neg	So basicly you have to pump into one bottle,  then transfer into this one (this causes a problem for those of us who don't produce quite enough milk --- every drop that is lost in transfer is crutial
__label__pos	"""I wish that I got it sooner!!"""
__label__neg	"""nope."""
__label__pos	You don't have to worry about nipple confusion with this bottle if u are using it to give the baby pumped milk while u are at work, have to supplement with formula or anything like that.
__label__pos	wireless router, phones, tvs, etc) the sound is good and there is not much noise.
__label__pos	However,  with safety in mind this is the best solution when compared with the hard surface lap travel trays
__label__pos	The tub fits perfectly in my kitchen sink, and has a little compartment to hold soap etc.
__label__pos	Will use again for next child! 
__label__neu	-- a $[...] teether crafted by hand in the French Alps from all natural rubber and paint 
__label__pos	For the time being I am pretty happy with it.
__label__neu	The seat seemed small and like she would grow out of it quickly.
__label__neg	 Also, the hammock has torn, even though our baby is well within the weight limit. 
__label__pos	The cover for the tray is nice since this booster was travelling with us, and it kept the actual tray clean for my son's finger foods.
__label__pos	I wouldn't have bought it myself, but since it was given to me, I am glad to have it.
__label__neu	Like L. Flack posted my daughter too looks up at the straps but with any toy you need to always supervise your child (not that L. Flack didn't by any means).
__label__neg	 I tend to use it for hot drinks, especially this time of year, and I can't put the drinks in the holder until they're more than half empty -- otherwise they'll spill everywhere. 
__label__neg	with practice, you eventually get used to it and the straps keeps twisting
__label__pos	"""This step stool will not budge, with all the rubber grips it has."""
__label__neu	I got this for her after being asked repeatedly to read the potty book for girls She was immediately  sitting on it without any prompting.
__label__neu	There is no need for boiling water or anything like that.
__label__neg	"""I personally would not have purchased it, because before my baby reached three months she had already outgrown it."""
__label__neg	It will not topple over as this is impossible.
__label__neg	 Not worth it.
__label__neu	The only time I warm up the bottle is if it's been in the fridge...at that point, I just run it under hot water to warm it up. 
__label__pos	"""These really do work."""
__label__neu	Notice that most positive reviews are from people who have not had it very long
__label__neg	it's more work to get the milk out of this bottle than it is to get it out of my breast
__label__pos	With regards to the reach, we have no problems. 
__label__neu	I bought these connectors
__label__neg	My only other issue is that it's very warm - and I live in a hot climate.
__label__neu	I was disappointed that it looks like one piece in the picture and doesn't show the gap or mention that it is a two-piece bumper.
__label__neu	Since we already have traditional swing from subsequent children I was really puzzled.
__label__neu	The pocket in the front seems great at first but then starts creating little holes in the wrap at the pockets corners.
__label__neu	It never worked right.
__label__neu	For first time parents, I urge you to try it out at WAl Mart or Target first, before ordering it online, based on good reviews. 
__label__neg	When making the purchase do it right the first time.
__label__pos	You can set it for just nature sounds if you don't like the music.
__label__pos	So far, I love all of the Baby Einstein items that we have purchased!
__label__pos	Obviously the bumper and the comforter don't get much use until baby is older because of the risk of suffocation but even with just the dust ruffle and sheet on the crib and the comforter hung over the end it still looks like a complete set and is very nice.
__label__neu	"""Update August 2012:  When my second son was born this summer, I re-evaluated the bottles that were available."""
__label__neu	So since the guard would not lay flat,  there is no way this would keep my son from getting into the dvd player.
__label__pos	The music is great & she loves to stare at the fish & lights in the water filled globe.
__label__neg	We didn't drop, wet, or otherwise abuse any of these units, and followed the recharge and usage instructions to a T
__label__neu	Finally,  today,  I put Snoogle's cover back on,  and after a half-hour of twisting,  writhing,  cursing and taking two breaks ... I got the stupid cover back on but didn't even have a post-coital glow as an added benefit.
__label__pos	Love this buggy.
__label__neu	I sat next to my 10 month old daughter the whole time but simply did not react fast enough when she leaned forward and tipped the entire apparatus (the high chair and the adult folding chair) forward
__label__neu	Freddie the firefly is a different story.
__label__neu	The size adjusts lengthwise and is large enough to fit the majority of adaptors.
__label__neg	"""Once installed, it's about two inches shorter than my daughter's crib rail."""
__label__neu	Our toddler was sleeping and we took the receivers outside so that we could visit our next door neighbor's backyard and it lost reception about 200 feet.
__label__pos	My baby would not sleep for more than 2 hours in a stretch, but the first night I used this, he slept for 4 hours straight.
__label__neu	There are other tubs with slings that are much better.
__label__pos	So much of our Gerber stuff shrunk after one wash that I haven't bought any more Gerber blankets,  onesies,  etc.
__label__pos	Our infant sits so snugly in the swing so she sleeps in it easily.
__label__pos	 A denser sponge holds soap better. 
__label__neg	Unfortunately he'll be in a regular seat soon and I don't think I'll be able to use them anymore.
__label__neu	But once we moved her into a big bathtub we realized we needed something more.
__label__pos	For us, it's been great!
__label__neu	However,  we attempted to fold it up to take it with us on a weekend away from home recently
__label__neu	I was hoping for something that would be soft.
__label__pos	Baby loves it.
__label__neu	Same problems as everyone else.
__label__neg	As we have used them more,  we have discovered that these bottles leak about 30% of the time
__label__neg	 I'm very short and this pillow was in a awkward position while breastfeeding, and wasn't long enough to offer the ever important elbow support
__label__pos	It mounted easily and firmly
__label__pos	We own 4 and I will probably be buying more of them.  
__label__neu	The bars on the gate are well-spaced so even small infants shouldn't be able to crawl through
__label__neu	I looked at it and thought what a great idea for a tub
__label__pos	just a little warm water and these clean up the poopiest of butts in a jiffy
__label__neu	I am five nine,  and it was too short by several inches.
__label__pos	This is my daughter's favorite thing to do
__label__neg	 Our seatbelts are too thin and the accessory that is supposed to take care of this problem is to large to properly fit on the belt between the base and the latch
__label__neu	So put it on straight and there's no problem!
__label__pos	It does seal out the orders reasonably well
__label__neg	The adhesive on the lining does not stay stuck to the bra and the absorbent filling comes loose and bunches up.
__label__neu	"About the color, it is a little more ""minty green"" than sage despite the picture."
__label__neu	Our son was perfectly fine when we transitioned him to his own room but my husband and I were a nervous wreck!
__label__neg	 It is also not very lightweight
__label__neu	I don't know if my son just has very sensitive skin or if it's because he is too big for the chair, but I switched to a soft seat that goes on the big toilet & we are trying that now
__label__neg	"""Even with the volume turned all the way up we couldn't hear our baby- Sometimes he would cry and we would hear him from the other room but the monitor wasn't registering it."""
__label__neu	I bought this for my son about 7 months ago and he did like it at first but it should be made a little bigger. 
__label__neu	"""Yes, you do have to ensure that the lids are ""primed"" (slightly wet the nipple, insert into cap, and pull up gently), and are on properly (tight but not too tight)."""
__label__pos	I got this as a gift and loved it for the first six months.
__label__neu	"""Munchkin also sells just the nipple that is compatable with the Avent bottle."""
__label__neg	"The ""fish"" (toys) inside did not move as much as I thought - maybe we didn't have it filled up right."
__label__pos	When my daughter outgrew the octoganal arrangement we just opened it up and have used it to block her from the kitchen and other dangerous areas.
__label__neu	"""We are using the Chicco KeyFit 30 car seat."""
__label__neg	"""At almost every playgroup I go to (and my diaper Genie as well) the top has not sealed the last diaper so when you go to put your new diaper in, you get the wonderful aroma of aged poop."""
__label__neg	They apparently didn't go through any physics classes on their way to their ged.
__label__pos	I registered for this tub because I thought it is very cool and so multi-functional. 
__label__pos	After breaking several fingernails trying to get outlet covers off, I tried several brands and found this to be the only one that didn't fight me.
__label__neu	I throw it in the laundry about once a week for a thorough cleaning and just wipe it down with a paper towel between meals.
__label__neg	You'll be able to tell if its faulty by just comparing how easily the left side comes undone to the right one.
__label__neu	I received it in about 4 days after calling. 
__label__neu	"It smells like plastic and the ""Organic Cotton"" title is completely misleading."
__label__neu	If you're like me you probably have tons of grocery bags laying around.
__label__neu	It worked!
__label__pos	A good wrap often quiets our baby down.
__label__neu	We have switched full time to A&D.
__label__neg	"""Also, parents should know, that when I had my carseat checked by the sheriff department's trained carseat safety deputy, I was told NOT to use one of these in a carseat UNLESS the seat comes with one that is made to specially fit that seat."""
__label__neg	I thought it was a actual kaleidoscope but it wasn't.
__label__neg	This tub was the worst! 
__label__pos	Awesome!
__label__pos	When I pull the liner out you can't even tell it has been sitting in water.(. )
__label__neu	It has a drink holder on each side and a small zipper/ mesh compartment for a few dollars in the middle open area.
__label__neg	After literally only a few diapers her entire room smelled of poop!
__label__neu	Second,  once your baby is down to a couple of ounces left in the bottle,  it is impossible to reach your fingers up in there to get any air out.
__label__neu	"But as she got older and the ""stuff"" got stronger, we tend to get a wiff when you walk by now and then (That just tells us that it's time to change the bag, and most times it's pretty full before you start to notice the smell, so it pretty much needs changed anyway). "
__label__neu	By the time we had our second child, we were still careful but just not quite so much.
__label__neu	Now that my son is holding his own bottle,  we don't use them for that fact-it's just too hard for him to get his formula to the nipple,  he gets too frustrated.
__label__neg	My mother gave this toy to my son envisioning a valedictorian or the reincarnation of Beethoven
__label__pos	"""This swing soothes a baby's nerves when they are in their ""4th trimester."""""
__label__neg	My daughter slips down her feel fall over the sides and there is not enough give in the fabric for the slind to cup her in.
__label__neg	You might as well use prefolds and use a cover and save LOTS of money rather than use these diapers. 
__label__neg	"""I hated that you had to keep on top of it or you would never know how long it was in there."""
__label__pos	 My 1yo & 3yo love it
__label__pos	It is very quiet as well.
__label__neu	I borrowed my sister's since I didn't need it for regular pumping,  but if I didn't have that one I would have to spend the money anyhow
__label__neu	We often don't have the cloth cover on it and as a result the kids have torn off the cover revealing the foam padding in spots.
__label__neg	 When will these companies just cut it out with the green lights
__label__pos	Since this is a child's toy, I think it's serves it's purpose well.  
__label__pos	I clip those to the hood of the carseat while driving
__label__pos	I've also used this as a prop to hold my baby up to take picturs.
__label__pos	The wheels are not plastic so the ride is really smooth. 
__label__neg	he tried it once or twice and just gave it this weird look,  like what is this
__label__pos	I still give it 2 stars,  because it's an otherwise neat idea.
__label__neg	 The Evenflo nipples were cheaper and better
__label__neg	Don't waste money
__label__neu	 NO
__label__neu	A smart buy, but will come in handy a little later than you might think.
__label__pos	And the soft blue light and gently moving animals help distract baby long enough for him to forget that he doesn't want to go to sleep and drift off into dreamland.
__label__neg	 Within one week, our 13 month old broke two of the gates
__label__neu	the tub is small to begin with and having the shower pump/spray inside the tub all the more makes it small.
__label__neg	This product is horrible
__label__pos	 I saw the good reviews and was so excited to get it. 
__label__neu	I couldn't reach the button to restart the song from the driver's seat.
__label__pos	"""I think once they hit the 6-month mark, they will enjoy it better."""
__label__neu	We'll see how it goes
__label__neu	This product is not grea.t
__label__neu	It still is not as pure & natural as this stuff,  but this really is protective & preventative,  not healing.
__label__neu	It can also double as a place to store your bottles.
__label__neu	I just got the Munchkin Arm and Hammer diaper pail to evaluate before its release next month and I tossed my old Diaper Genie right in the trash
__label__neu	I received two of these as a gift.
__label__neg	now that he is 2 month it's already getting small for him
__label__pos	This never happened when we used it and I can't imagine how it happened to them.
__label__pos	Love this monitor
__label__neu	Once you know how to wrap it using it has never been easier
__label__neu	 I returned these to Babies R' Us for a credit and bought Playtex Drop-In system bottles (liners are BPA free) and they have been great
__label__pos	And I didn't mind wearing it.
__label__neu	 It is AMAZING and worth every penny--instead of buying several of these, buy ONE Amazing Miracle Blanket and test it out
__label__neg	I bought this for my baby brother,  Jay.
__label__neg	I now have six bottles but just the one spout.
__label__pos	"""Easy to clean (except the keys in the piano part those are more difficult)."""
__label__neg	I bought a diaper genie for my baby, despite numerous people telling me it wasnt worth it
__label__neg	I threw ours out
__label__pos	It fits in any sink you put it in, single or double, and it will save your back, not having to bend over your own bathtub.
__label__neg	With breast feeding she hardly ever burped.
__label__neu	I registered for this item and received it as a gift,  why,  I don't know
__label__neg	We just got this mattress and I'm worried about using it for the baby because it does NOT seem as firm as crib mattresses are supposed to be
__label__neg	"""Please be aware of the color differences if you are considering purchasing the set."""
__label__pos	She loves the Twinkle Twinkle little star song and we often play it while I am changing her.  
__label__neu	I had been using a manual before I bought this.
__label__neg	sometimes.
__label__neu	One one hand I liked the softness of the Carter's brand bumper, but I liked the breathable bumper because my daughter was born in the beginning of summer and I wanted her to stay as cool as possible; so I bought the breathable bumper. 
__label__neu	It is bulky and a pain to use.
__label__neg	 I have told my friends who are registering now to save their money and find an alternate bottle
__label__neg	I introduced at 6 months,  and then every few weeks after that.
__label__neg	The hot sensor is silly though, we peeled it off.
__label__neg	I didn't like these towels.
__label__neg	The company has lost my trust -- I will no longer buy any Baby Einstein products.
__label__neg	It is a terrible product. 
__label__neu	I ran out to buy this at the suggestion of the hospital's lactation consultant right after delivering our daughter in November
__label__pos	The baby sits with correct posture (The Bjorn is not so great for the baby's spine) and the parent is not in pain!
__label__neg	"""I do wish the strap was more adjustable so it could extend further."""
__label__neg	The first night I tried this,  my newborn slid down in between the bumpers.
__label__pos	"""It is a very nice blanket and we love to go for a pick nick or just relax on teh nature with our baby."""
__label__pos	"""After trying those, we ended up purchasing more Breastflow bottles as these caused the least amount of confusion and latch issues."""
__label__neg	Now, the reason for the two stars: the motor went out
__label__neg	I tried adjusting the different music settings to totally off with no luck.
__label__neg	I never felt like my baby was truely secure in his spot while in the Ktan.
__label__pos	"""I bought mine used on ebay and it was worth the $35 I spent."""
__label__neg	 She has had this since she was about three months old, and now that she is nearly six, she still isn't too impressed with it
__label__pos	it was a little expensive but worth the price.
__label__neu	I bought this and set it up days before our daugther was born
__label__neu	My last experience with baby swings was in the 1980's when they could hold the weight of a small adult.
__label__neu	The different sizes allow allow us to organize some if we choose or grab one to take on a trip.
__label__neu	We had a first years monitor with our older son and bought this when we had a second.
__label__neg	You have to be careful when removing it from the microwave it's extremely hot and can cause serious burns.
__label__neu	Some bibs are thin but this has a thickness to it.
__label__pos	Once I gave in, I was glad I did.  
__label__neu	These were SUCH a pain to clean and use - my kitchen looked like a science lab.
__label__neu	Even my husband is unable to.
__label__neu	It's 4 screws and an allen key (supplied) and otherwise snaps together.
__label__neu	"I am able to carry him comfortably for as much as 2 hours and he weighs over 12 pounds (I'm only 5'2"".)"
__label__neg	 They appear great at first but go downhill quickly
__label__pos	I also very much like the little shelf -- it's perfect for storing a bottle or two of bath wash
__label__neg	"""It could be that mine is missing something though."""
__label__pos	I have not had issues with pumping so it may be useful if you do.
__label__neu	"""you can careless how big and this darn thing is!"""
__label__neu	I was originally looking at buying a potty chair that had all the bells and whistles flush noises music lights the works.
__label__neu	Bright Lights!
__label__pos	"""It's so comfortable on your shoulders and fits a TON of stuff."""
__label__neu	The thermometer beeps continually if the temperature of the water leaves the appropiate temperature range-- too hot or too cold.
__label__neu	I choose these bottles because they are very popular but then realized that the size of them are so large that the baby never really seems to be able to get a good hold on them.
__label__neu	It probably depends on your stove
__label__neu	It is as if the angle of the door closing means the locks and catches do not line up properly. 
__label__pos	"""It is so worth the money because of the amount that can be sterilized at one time, the time that it saves you (vs. boiling bottles), and the ease."""
__label__neg	I was getting desperate for additional support and based on all the postive reviews,  bought this pillow during my sixth month of pregnancy.
__label__neu	What I have found, though, is that it is totally easy to make this dog squeak if you just mash his bottom on a hard surface.  
__label__pos	When we pulled over it was much easier to feed her in the car with the help of the Boppy.
__label__pos	"""This fits right on your chair, or you can use it on the floor."""
__label__pos	The speakers were a neat unique feature.
__label__pos	 At first she did not care about the light show at all, but now that she is three months she loves the light show and the butterflies, they make her smile
__label__neu	The on/off switch needs to re-designed before it is safe to use.
__label__neg	They should really work on a design to make it stick better!
__label__pos	They also save time in prepping; I only washed mine a couple times before using vs. 5 or 6 with prefolds and contours.
__label__neg	You have to poke them through
__label__neg	As for the smell issue.
__label__neg	This product makes me crazy! 
__label__neu	I bought my son the pack n' play in rise n' shine with a bassinet.
__label__pos	"""We took it to Disney and put our food and camera and kid stuff in it."""
__label__pos	"""The labels included are in blue, pink, and a neutral (I'm not sure if this was in the product description, but here it is again)."""
__label__pos	It is also nice that is has the waterproof fabric on both sides so it is very easy to clean.
__label__pos	"""Then open with the steam side away from you and hang your things up to dry."""
__label__neu	Go with Lansiloh or better yet Johnson and Johnson if you can find them.
__label__pos	"""I have nursed my son while walking around a store and nobody new what I was doing."""
__label__neu	When I was pregnant I couldn't understand why these were so popular especially at the cost of $20 each.
__label__neu	We highly recommend the diaper champ.
__label__neu	"Is it going to be worth the premium cost?"""
__label__neg	This is a good idea, but for a little kid, it's a little complicated
__label__neg	Also, there is no cushion for supporting the belly whatsoever, so if that is what you are looking for do not buy this item. 
__label__neu	"""The pee pee diapers go into the regular trash b/c that goes out every other day anyway."""
__label__pos	"""It is the first and only one I have purchased after reading several reviews."""
__label__neu	Well, after finally getting frustrated with lining them up along the edge of the tub, I found this little cubby at Wal-mart one day. 
__label__pos	She is 2 1/2 months now, and she fits just fine in the tub.  
__label__neu	Our microwave is too small to warm the standard 8 ounce in. 
__label__neg	Who has time to search for the right parts when their baby is hungry and crying?
__label__pos	 We preferred the Kiddopotumus swaddle blanket.
__label__pos	i can successfully pump 2-4oz in 10-15 min with this pump.
__label__pos	While we still like to write down times to keep track, I really like having the Itzbeen.
__label__neg	This pump is very slow so unless you have 45 minutes to an hour to pump 4 ounces, don't get this
__label__neg	After about 8 months, things start to no longer function:- Adjusting the volume button results in speak not working.
__label__pos	They do an OK job preventing bubbles in the formula,  but they have two main problems
__label__pos	This is a great booster:-The seat is padded and comfortable-It's very easy to clean and (so far) doesn't stain-The bottom doesn't scratch your chair-Straps to the chair and has an optional lap belt-The funky colors are kind of cool (I have the orange)Overall a really well designed seat: functional and stylish.
__label__neg	), and overheating is another risk factor for SIDS.
__label__pos	We LOVE this sippy and recommend highly!
__label__neg	Too loud. 
__label__neu	They also said that the headrest for the infant seat was dangerous because it adds more room between baby and the seat,  which may cause the baby to be injury seriously in an accident.
__label__neu	Beyond me.
__label__neg	Also the bottom few wipes always seem to get dry and brown so we waste a few wipes with each refill
__label__neg	 BUT it has an issue with batteries
__label__pos	"""I absolutely love these cloth diapers."""
__label__pos	We love the idea of having the key so the child cannot get into the cabinet. 
__label__neu	The netting never gets clean in the dishwasher.
__label__neu	Before buying make sure the length is long enough for your rail
__label__pos	They are a little big for my cosco play yard, but they're overall good, especially for the price!
__label__neu	then after I was convinced it wouldn't leak
__label__neg	- No valve except the hole in the cup spout.
__label__pos	It was the only toy that his weak and uncoordinated grasp could master and I particularly love the padded links because they were gentler on his gums.
__label__pos	"""They work great on the carpet there, although it is very thin and flat."""
__label__neu	He is teething but I think he would like it anyway because it is so easy to grab and squeak!
__label__neu	I used this tub with my 1st son almost 4 years ago and now I bought a new one for my 2nd son born this year
__label__pos	Made my life easy.
__label__neu	, 2004, 1091836800B00005BTNAANDCIRDLNLV47, B00005BTNA, ANDCIRDLNLV47, Marcus I threw them all out.
__label__pos	When our son was still in a bassinet, the sleep sack worked well with a sleep positioner to keep him on his back.
__label__neu	This one will be placed on Freecycle.
__label__neg	I just think it's a little pricey for the product.  
__label__neg	I would not recommend these, there are far better bottles out there, we also use Momo glass bottles, and I am very pleased with them.
__label__pos	"""Straps are easy to adjust and not a lot of twisting."""
__label__pos	This is a great item to help your child strengthen their legs, plus the added bonus of wearing them out before nap time!
__label__pos	It wasn't until he was 4 months that he really started to like it.  
__label__neg	Returning it immediately
__label__neu	The older one can be found in most children's consignment stores and is much better.  
__label__neu	He sleeps better...
__label__pos	"""I have been using it for several children of several ages, eating lots of different stuff: formula, baby food, table food."""
__label__neu	The only thing that has not held up is the hook but that is because my son pulled on it while it was hanging on a hook. 
__label__pos	It did hold all of the Ventaire part well which that would be the only plus for this item.The wide neck bottles fit better in the dryer but still didn't fit well.
__label__neg	This can result in diaper rashes. 
__label__pos	This sterilizer is so easy to use even a dad like me can use it.
__label__pos	so much fun - for me and my wee one
__label__neu	Got this just for its dual purpose of being able to use on a regular toilet and on the go.  
__label__neu	So far, I've just wiped it down, but it's machine washable in case we ever have a messy incident.
__label__neg	at a time b/c it hurts my back so bad! 
__label__neu	If you are looking for the best bottle or nipple,  I recommend NAM
__label__pos	"""They are soft rubber material so he can chew on them too."""
__label__neu	I could have used this a long time ago.
__label__neu	it was too big on my small frame and my son's head wasnt well supported.
__label__neg	It's been only less than 2 mos but the top of the rack can never be positioned stable
__label__neu	g
__label__neu	100% of the time! 
__label__neg	I was very skeptical at first.
__label__pos	:)  She loves it!  
__label__neg	 I followed the cleaning instructions that accompanied the mirror, but to my dismay, nothing worked. 
__label__pos	The cup is easy to clean (its only 3 pieces as opposed to the 5 or 6(w/handles) pieces for the avent cup) assemble and use.
__label__neg	 It seems as though the receiver on the mirror is defective
__label__neu	But because he wouldn't be covered with water, I turned the bathroom heater on 5 mins before bathtime so he wouldn't get cold.
__label__neg	I do like that I can use it in the sink,  but he's not a super long baby and his little feet always get stuck in the grooves where the tub folds
__label__pos	(A big bonus when dealing with a wiggling baby.)
__label__pos	These bibs fit on my Baby Bjorn great.
__label__neg	It was not a small leak rather, a pouring leak that soaked their shirts.
__label__pos	My daughter is very comfortable in it.
__label__pos	I've heard good things about the Woombie too.
__label__neg	these bottles are not worth the money.. 
__label__neu	There is also a side pouch for more storage (I put a blanket and cloths there too).
__label__pos	But it does loosen up and becomes easy enough to setup alone.
__label__neu	It looked so complicated,  and I could not figure out how to adjust anything.
__label__neu	The BEST,  in my honest opinion,  is the Ergo.
__label__pos	"""This is a great seat protector."""
__label__pos	Those bottles are a hundred times better
__label__neg	I'm a little tired of all the toys that I've come across that don't really do anything except drain batteries.
__label__pos	We received this toy at our baby shower,  and were thrilled to get it
__label__neu	Of course that is the point - no heat no bugs killed!
__label__neg	A few reviewers have complained that they are hard to clean.
__label__pos	Then I realized that my son would love it.
__label__neu	I bought numerous other brands of sippy cups, and most of them he can't manage to get any drink.
__label__pos	I bought this for my three month old son and we are really pleased with it.
__label__pos	00, and I like it much better
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	"""What's not to love?"""
__label__neg	This product should have been designed to accommodate more styles of spigots
__label__pos	She enjoys bouncing around and loves that she can turn all the way around in the chair to play with all the toys but also to face Mommy and Daddy when they walk to a different part of the room or into the kitchen.
__label__pos	"""They are both my husbands and my favs."""
__label__neu	I say trying because she is breastfed and hasn't even learned to use a bottle yet.
__label__neg	I hate this monitor. 
__label__neg	"not ""sausage links"" for us"
__label__neu	I would not recommend buying a crib set.
__label__neg	I bought this hoping I could get the best of both worlds: a great toy for my son to look at and a mirror that would let me see him when I am driving
__label__pos	Dr. Brown's bottles are the BEST BOTTLES ON THE MARKET!
__label__neu	I have found this to be the easiest method of protection concerning stoves.
__label__neg	These are NOT dishwasher safe
__label__neu	So in the warmer months, I had to dress him in only a diaper shirt to prevent him from sweating.
__label__neg	It's not very useful for watering my plants either.
__label__neg	You can never tie them tight enough and spills are frequent.
__label__neu	The number one important feature of any car seat should be the SAFETY RATING!  
__label__neg	 All in all, I'm really disappointed in these bags, and the only positive side to them is I haven't had any burst in the freezer
__label__neg	 I was packing the car to go on a trip with him in it
__label__pos	"""Ordered one for myself and cant do without."""
__label__neu	It has 2 bars, one for kicking, or just reverse the baby when he gets bored. 
__label__neu	 This started happening after about 3 weeks of age
__label__pos	It never gets old! 
__label__pos	It has two different swinging positions, both of which my baby likes.  
__label__neu	A complete waste of money,  maybe my daughter will use them to play with her dolls years down the road.
__label__neu	Now, 6 months later, he's still a bouncing fool! 
__label__pos	"""I put both my 2 boys in it and it was a sanity saver!"""
__label__neg	 I'd never buy from Avent again, or use anything from Avent again. 
__label__pos	 It is the perfect size and shape too! 
__label__neg	I just don't like this product
__label__pos	The musical blinking star is fun and once he learned that he could start it by pulling a toy hard enough he played it all the time.
__label__pos	My 3 1/2 year old still hasn't figured out how to open it, but it's easy enough for me to open quickly.
__label__pos	When I put him in his crib, my hope is that he'll fall asleep and this First Years mobile does just that!The remote is also a great feature so I don't have to come into the room while he is about to fall asleep.And finally...I love that this can be used at night!
__label__neg	My 3 month old loves playing with this toy when he is in his car seat,  but he can now grab the toys and pull them.
__label__neu	Big mistake.
__label__neg	 What a waste of money
__label__neg	If that is what the manufactorer considers cusioning I'm not impressed.
__label__pos	"""our baby loves it so much, we gladly paid the $20 again to bring her much needed relief from teething pain."""
__label__pos	i'm not sure what the other reviewer said about dye leaking they have thoroughly chewed everything they could reach and we have not encountered that problem.
__label__pos	Please don't waste your time with the others-----you get what you pay for in this case.
__label__pos	It really does the trick! 
__label__pos	I like that you can choose which was it'll swing (side to side or front to back) as each baby is different in their preferences!
__label__neg	The AC adaptor and sound selections are great, but the sound is way too low, even on the highest level. 
__label__pos	But all in all, once a baby gets to jump in something, there is no going backward to stationary.
__label__neg	I say if you are really worried about germs in public restrooms either use a non-folding seat or steer clear of them
__label__neg	It took 2 wks for them to arrive. 
__label__pos	They are MUCH better than the Gerber ones.  
__label__pos	And I love the ceiling display.
__label__neg	Our turtle came unglued at the neck,  around the plastic and the fabric and the stuffing started coming out.
__label__neg	Like many extraneous baby items that I purchased because I was so excited about my impending arrival, this item got zero usage.
__label__pos	It's really helping his motor skills develop and he has so much fun. 
__label__neu	My husband loves to dine out.
__label__pos	"""We attach it to everything, the side of her basinett, her swing, wherever she goes."""
__label__pos	It's very relaxing to watch - almost hypnotic.
__label__pos	 I have been successfully nursing for going on 9 months now. 
__label__neu	I was so excited about this product it being 100% polycarbonate-free and all that, but my baby did not share my excitement. 
__label__neu	He fits securely into the reclined side of the tub,  with no slipping.
__label__neu	We are still using it and it is pretty stable after I wrapped a few rubber bands around the faucet (under the Boon Flo) and one around the back
__label__neu	The tape is pointless as they don't move around at all as did none of the others brands I tried
__label__neg	 If I can get them clean enough I will just stop using them in the bath
__label__pos	I bought this instead of a high chair for the convenience factor and it is really cute
__label__neg	 This is our list of issues:- The flow rate on the newborn nipple is the fastest of any bottle we've tried, it's not even close to a real breast
__label__neg	 They do just the opposite
__label__neg	This spacious bottle rack looked like it would be the answer to all my problems!Sadly, my dreams of an organized countertop, with bottles drying neatly on a rack rather than an assortment of paper towels, were not to be. 
__label__neu	3) LEAKS
__label__neg	I had to take the unit apart and disable them.
__label__neu	I got an Ergo Baby Carrier instead and I love it so much more - it doesn't allow the babies to look out like in the Bjorn, but my baby doesn't mind, and the Ergo can be worn on my back when my baby can hold his head up better
__label__neu	I have yet to use the medicine dropper or water temp taker but I doubt there is anything wrong with those items.
__label__pos	MUCH better
__label__neg	We put a changing pad on top of the dryer so we wouldn't have to run upstairs all the time to change diapers (we had 2 children in diapers at the same time) well soon we started to notice an odor and it didn't go away.
__label__neg	The only issues I had with it was the amount of time spent trying to figure out how to get the butterflies to move (they don't) and that there are no extra rings to add length (a little short for a 3 month old to view AND grab at the same time) or to attach more of your own toys.
__label__neu	I recevied them all.
__label__neg	I thought that it would be a better deal than Avent and boy was I wrong.
__label__neu	 I would finish pumping and da baby would be getting up for a feeding
__label__pos	It's great, even if you're not nursing!
__label__pos	"""I'd rather invest the extra money of a 2nd tub in my daughter's college fund."""
__label__neg	I hate them which is why I only gave this product 4 stars and debated giving it only 3.
__label__pos	Great table for a great price!
__label__pos	The refills are very simple to replace and when it's time to empty the pail, all you do is cut the bag, tie a knot and you're done!
__label__neu	Ok, so the dresser was only $200 (plus shipping), but I would have rather had a little more drawer space
__label__neg	Lastly, too short! 
__label__pos	And the music is cute hence the two stars,  but it is only one song and soon becomes boring
__label__neu	"""I bought this pump when my son was 3 weeks old."""
__label__neu	Save the money and just cut up an old pair of suspenders.
__label__neg	 But then it also pulled some milk down the hose, luckly it did not go into the motor
__label__pos	It has such clarity and a great range.
__label__neg	It is very wide and even when folded requires quite a bit of space.
__label__pos	Spend A Little More For This Slipcover!!
__label__neu	My mattress is water proof plus I do not use it to change diapers.
__label__pos	I just add water whenever I add wipes  it's a no-brainer!
__label__pos	"""Unquestionably the best bathtub to keep your little baby secure while you use both hands to bathe him."""
__label__pos	"""It was so cozy for him."""
__label__neu	But he is growing very fast and may be too long then.
__label__neg	Save yourself the hassle and buy a different mirror
__label__pos	Great for everywhere
__label__pos	Though the large straps on the BB would probably extend enough to also fit my husband I wasnt spending a $100 and not be sure not to mention $30 is a lot less to have to spend- our budget really wouldnt allow for such a splurge!
__label__pos	She loves it and I love it because I don't have to watch my 5 day old baby struggle to eat!
__label__pos	These pads are two of the best items I have purchased so far for my baby
__label__neg	 We had to put a large bear-shaped foam bath sponge between him and the sling to minimize the slipping, but we still had to readjust him quite frequently. 
__label__pos	Just get the Easy Expression Bustier and you're truly hands-free.
__label__pos	This has been a terrific buy
__label__neu	when your baby outgrows it,  make it into a dog bed
__label__neu	"""We've only used this tub a handful of times because our son is only 3 weeks old."""
__label__neu	Also,  it's a little bit short and I cannot place my legs comfortably.
__label__neg	If you walk by the receiver using the cordless or cellphone it completely loses all reception and all you hear is static. 
__label__pos	After using it for only 2 days, my nipple had healed sufficiently, and I no longer needed to use the shield.
__label__pos	"""He would stare at this rainforest and seemed really engaged so we bought one so he would have it at home too (my husband wanted him to have something familiar at home- so cute!)"""
__label__neg	Looks cute, but started falling apart within 6 months
__label__neu	Works well on contoured pad....
__label__neg	I use this for less than 1 month: The quality of the material (plasitc) is bad and cheap, it doesnt control de odor ( the room really stinks) and it broked after a month of use, and the refills cost too much money! 
__label__neg	We also found that the plastic that the baby is changed on stains very easily. 
__label__neu	I'm all about new and up dating,  even though it's on 1 child,  I like to research and know that it's the best or at least the close to it
__label__neu	We registered for this site unseen based on the reviews.
__label__neu	I did my research and decided this was the pump that would suit my needs. 
__label__neu	Not all of Nuby's bottles are BPA Free.  
__label__pos	It's simple to use and is cost efficient
__label__neu	"""The directions say to wash the bottles with soapy water before using this contraption..."""
__label__neu	I registered for this product because I have a small house and didn't have a good place to store a full-sized baby tub.
__label__neu	The Diaper genie is good for when your baby is an newborn (1-3 months) After they are 4 months there doo doo really stinks and the smell does come out a little bit even if you change it every other day.
__label__neg	They are expensive too,  a total waste of money
__label__pos	"""you can use it to keep anything from being thrown on the ground, including a sippy cup."""
__label__pos	It was perfect.
__label__pos	"""The little latches on the sides never come undone unless I open them."""
__label__pos	 However, it is quite a bit larger than I expected, which is a plus I guess. 
__label__pos	He really only enjoys them when I do things like toss them in the water and make splashes
__label__neu	However, I quickly realized after two days home that a drying rack was essential.  
__label__neg	 would not get this one again
__label__neg	However, it did not live up to expectations.  
__label__neu	It plays tunes when peed in, although as the baby soon figured out, if you bounce up and down hard enough, it will play, diluting the reward feature.
__label__neg	It doesn't colapse or open easily leaving a large tub
__label__neg	 He hate the Playtex disposables too
__label__pos	Now at 11 weeks old I use the Boppy to nurse everyday and night.
__label__pos	In comparison to the other seats I've purchased, this seat is the best because less pee gets on the floor - I might just have to try putting silicon around the base to keep it from filling with pee though... 
__label__neu	Buy a few as your wife will want to wash it when the infant spits throws up etc
__label__neg	Not very practical
__label__pos	All in all it's a good toy.
__label__pos	I think Gerber has the best skin care line.
__label__neg	 I switched to Dr
__label__neu	Then the wet diapers get tossed to the regular garbage and taken out daily.
__label__pos	If you only use a bottle once in a while - use browns - but if you use them a lot - get Avent.
__label__neu	It takes over a day to dry,  which means if you use it daily you can expect mold/mildew.
__label__pos	They do help to reduce air.
__label__neg	And for the price compared to other bouncy seats (like the $20 one I bought and my daughter loved),  it was a big time waste of money
__label__neu	Although she mostly likes to make the scrunchy noise and chew on the squeak bubble.
__label__neu	The Inclined to Sleep looks comfortable,  but not when the little one wakes up crying and uncomfortable!
__label__neg	It leaks every time I use it.
__label__neg	 In my opionion its NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ALL
__label__neg	What a poor choice!  
__label__pos	Very stylish and seems to be very sturdy.
__label__pos	"""the cover is also very easy to take off when you want to wash it (no screwdrivers needed)."""
__label__neg	Everyone seems to have different experiences with these things,  but we just couldn't get it to stop leaking
__label__pos	I love that it slides to the side as well as opens. 
__label__neg	Yes they leak, I mean POUR milk from under the sealing ring
__label__pos	I love that the padding is removable for washing or for hot days.  
__label__pos	I love that you can use trash bags.
__label__neg	"""She has a two story house and when I would put the baby down I couldn't hear her cry from downstairs."""
__label__pos	so easy to change the sheets and pull in and out of the crib, even overnight for those emergency changes.
__label__neu	We liked the idea of it being a front or back carrier,  however it just doesn't seem to work with our bodies.
__label__neg	We were wrong.  
__label__pos	There is nothing more satisfying than a child smile and laugh.
__label__neu	I considered re-installing it using the screws but just went for a simple door handle lock (I had to change the cabinet handles from knobs to D-shaped ones). 
__label__neg	Not, NOT for newborns!!!
__label__neu	With that one, I got a total of 10oz in 5-10 min. 
__label__pos	If you use regular bottles,  the Evenflo set is 1/3 of the price and fits right in.
__label__neg	I found it such a hassle to program that we never used it as a two room monitor.
__label__neg	OK DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU HATE NOISES.
__label__neg	I also have a microwave steam sterilizer
__label__neu	Why they don't just say THAT on the description I don't know.
__label__pos	The only tub to buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__neg	I BOUGHT A PANORAMIC SIZE FRAME AND RESTED THE STANDING PART UNDER MY TV AND NOW IT'S BLOCKED
__label__neu	I like that these crinkle and have different visual effects as she's starting to explore the world around her but when she tries to stack them they tumble over or cave in.
__label__pos	It makes feeding time infinitely easier- I don't have to completely strip down my toddler anymore or spend hours trying to clean out stains.
__label__neu	The material is very rough and the sheet doesn't fit well when the mattress is in the bassinet position.
__label__neu	I had planned to use them to hold diapers and baby toiletries. 
__label__neg	"""I have always just warmed the bottle in the microwave."""
__label__pos	I am a pretty frugal person, but this was worth the splurge 3 years ago.
__label__neg	"""After about a month of rare use the star shaped piece that creates the vacuum started getting sucked down into the bottle."""
__label__pos	Tonight he was in it for 2 1/2 hrswhile watching Baby Einstein Videos.
__label__pos	When my daughter does this I puller her attention to her toys and the handle bar and she gets to jumping and watching the lights flash.
__label__neu	And you moms know it is NICE to sleep in when you have a baby!
__label__neg	Besides, you want the water to flow and be replaced for a baby, NOT have an infant or toddler sitting in a tub full of dirty and soapy water, which may contribute to genital and rectal problems. 
__label__neg	The seat is so huge that our only option was to put it behind the front passenger seat
__label__neu	like the bigger babies are supposed to sit in it)
__label__neg	The firefighter said this could weaken the seat belt over time and it may break in a crash.
__label__pos	Newborns can be so wriggly &amp; this product was a great help at bath-time! 
__label__neu	We bought this primarily because it had better reviews than the Diaper Genie when we bought it and that we don't have to buy special bags.
__label__pos	"""The Avent pads were relatively inexpensive and work wonderfully!"""
__label__neg	 I read the reviews on this and knew what I was getting myself into, but thought oh, since I generally have good luck with products, it'll be OK
__label__neu	I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom
__label__pos	Like the reviewer who gave it a low rating, I also have small breasts, but unlike her, I found this pillow very helpful. 
__label__neg	Its probably a matter of preference what you like and what you intend to use these multi-purpose cloths for.On the downside, these shrunk slightly more than the other Gerbers, and are now an inch smaller on each side.
__label__neu	The bags were difficult to put in and the larger the diapers the harder to twist them in the pail.
__label__pos	 (Though our baby doesn't really complain about it)
__label__pos	no gas,  no sucking problems
__label__neu	I see why this thing got 4 stars-- all of these parents have young children!
__label__neg	but really, the bottles should be prepared to handle that
__label__neg	Try it in the store on a stroller like you own before buying!
__label__neu	The first time we put her in it she just sat there for a minute or two before wanting out
__label__neg	 so if you buy this, plan to use it as a permanent fixture under your chair, scooted all the way up to the table, because it is virtually un-moveable once you get it in place. 
__label__neu	If the tube assembly is crooked and not on straight, the bottle will leak.  
__label__neu	We had to hold it under running water which takes forever.
__label__neu	I swear I don't work for them--it's just that the blanket design is amazing and miraculous!
__label__neu	"""she started shifting herself around to get to different toys."""
__label__pos	He loves the sound she makes and his face lights up when you squeeze her in front of him.
__label__neu	she tossed & turned and took awhile to fall asleep.  
__label__pos	Both my husband who is a foot taller then I and myself both enjoyed using this and it worked great.
__label__pos	Very happy with them!
__label__neg	We have noticed that with repeated washing these bottles don't hold ink very well so we have to put the names back on the bottles about once a week for the daycare.  
__label__pos	"""I bought a Siver Cross for long walks, etc. - I bought this Baby Trend and LOVE it for shopping, etc."""
__label__pos	That worked for me!
__label__pos	"""Definitely a 5 star product!"""
__label__neu	If it works, then buy more sets online.
__label__pos	It is a handy pump to have.
__label__neg	WITH ALL THE FABRIC IT JUST SEEMS AWKWARD
__label__neg	We've been testing bottles with our newborn
__label__neu	Have the Bjorn seat in another bathroom that works really well.  
__label__pos	Worth the money, for us at least.
__label__neg	 This one just didn't hold up for us.
__label__pos	It's great exercise for babies, and I love that the whole unit can be lifted as the child gets older.
__label__pos	"""I was shocked."""
__label__neu	We already have a 2 year old son, and he has slept in our bed from birth--hated his crib!
__label__neu	"I'm 5'7"" and about 5 months preggo."
__label__pos	"""This is a very nice product."""
__label__neu	Lifting my daughter's mattress takes no effort
__label__neu	This caused liquid to run out, which he then smeared around.
__label__pos	This works perfectly to hang the seat by its plastic handle when not in use.
__label__neu	We ended up using it in front of the door where I can put him in for a few seconds until I put my shoes on when we go for a walk I would not recommend this product first of all because of the very easy to remove toy bar.
__label__pos	This is great for keeping the bottle or sippy cup attached to high chair, stroller, car seat, anything.
__label__pos	"""2)  Easy to assemble/disassemble - but not so easy that the kids could do it"""
__label__neg	) I haven't been able to figure out how to fix it, so we are using a Safety 1st Diaper Pail now, and the Diaper Champ will be hauled to the road for the trash pickup next week
__label__pos	Of all the tubs i researched, this was also one of the biggest which will transition well when he can sit up.
__label__neg	I had trouble getting my breastfed baby to take an Avent bottle (which my first took beautifully) so I called the lactation consultants at the hospital to ask their advice.
__label__pos	This bath is a lifesaver, it fits over our sink beautifully and is really sturdy and a great design, well worth the money and very pleased with it.  
__label__pos	The slats also allow toys to drain nicely.  
__label__neu	The white lights are useless,  but the blue and green work great.
__label__neu	I do have an old victorian with very big doorway molding though so I don't know about newer homes with small molding.
__label__neg	Talk about almost having a heart attack on the spot!FP should just stop making this model period.
__label__neu	If you want to completely eliminate diaper odors you'll have to take each diaper out of the house immediately.
__label__pos	A good buy & fit on the pack-n-play but also on the changing table late on.
__label__neg	I have found that a little plastic cup works much better to rinse baby off with.
__label__pos	I thought the were cute and would look cute in my sons room. 
__label__pos	We've had this mobile for about 2 weeks now...no battery changes needed and it is working just fine!
__label__neg	"""I'll keep looking for a snack cup that she can use without making a mess."""
__label__neg	"They do not leave ""clean"" dogs behind"
__label__pos	LOVE
__label__neg	They allow to much air to enter the baby's system
__label__neu	The refills are really expensive.
__label__neu	But I bribed him with his favorite toy and now all is well.
__label__pos	And it looks REALLY cool too
__label__pos	Additionally, there is a very easy floor tether that secures this carseat further, even in the rear-facing position (The First Years True Fit offers no such tether, and Britax's rear-facing tether is strung over baby's head!) and even if your car doesn't come manufactured with a specific tether point!
__label__neu	I suggest you buy or register for both (avent and dr brown)so if your baby does ok with gas and colic you use avent, and if not, you use dr brown (at least for a while). 
__label__pos	I don't know how long he'll be entertained by this now that he is crawling around some, but so far it's his favorite toy and allows me a good 20 minutes of free time - which for him is amazing!
__label__neu	I'm a carrier addict and recently (reluctantly) added an Ergo to my collection.  
__label__neu	I am thinking of trying the level 2 refills before I buy a whole different unit though so maybe that will help.
__label__neu	After all,  I've been quite happy with other Fisher Price items I own.
__label__pos	I think it would have really been helpful those first few weeks!
__label__pos	I love that I don't have to use any chemicals on my son's delicate skin and I can use a dry one to make sure his skin dries before putting a new diaper on him
__label__neu	Thus we ended up resorting to co- sleeping (usually nursing him to sleep) or swinging him to sleep in his carseat (ouch!)Then a friend asked to try the Miracle Blanket on our son and I said Why not?
__label__neu	My windows in the back have a curved edge to them.
__label__neg	Doesn't move from that.
__label__neu	When I first used this on him he gave me a puzzled look and then laughed.
__label__pos	I don't know what we would do with out it.
__label__pos	The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto.
__label__pos	"""The gate has stayed in place for about two months now."""
__label__pos	It is also much easier to figure out how to use and to get him in and out of
__label__pos	"""loved it!"""
__label__neu	We did not have this exact jumperoo, but a slightly older version of the Fisher Price Jumperoo made to look like a pony.  
__label__neg	they bearly used it.
__label__neg	 I wouldn't buy this tub
__label__neu	The other tub he cried like life as we know it was ending.
__label__pos	"""This play yard gate has been a sound investment."""
__label__neg	I tried giving him this bottle and he couldnt get anything out of it
__label__pos	"""I was excited to discover that you can unclip and unvelcro it and attach it to the handle of your stroller!"""
__label__neg	It is a little too thin for my taste,  but most covers seem to be
__label__neu	haha.. 
__label__neg	Mine tilts a bit as well, but we've gotten better at adjusting the baby so he's not rolling around. 
__label__pos	Bottles that grow with your child
__label__neg	It didn't stick and would pop up in spots after a while, even though we followed the directions each time...
__label__pos	I had one with my first two children and it may be more of a hassle to use but I do not recall it omitting as much odor as the Diaper Dekor Plus.
__label__neu	UPDATE---> I'm writing this note because after reading my comment after a year I have to say that I wrote this review stating that the items doesn't work for a newborn as they promise, but most of the items you can use them for an older baby
__label__pos	It distributes the weight well.It also made is possible to hold my daughter at the same time (in my arms on in the Baby Bjorn).Good product!The only complaint is the space (which hasn't been a problem yet).
__label__neu	Pros
__label__neu	I bought this sling because my son would not sleep unless I was holding him
__label__neg	 Those are much easier to use and less akward for baby
__label__pos	"""This is the best car seat out there in my opinion."""
__label__pos	Well,  its big and soft
__label__neu	after this i reluctantly tried the Dr Browns bottles and i am glad i did because they worked great the first day,  no gas or colic and baby slept all nite  :-)
__label__neg	Sadly it arrived right before the holidays and we only had 15 days for returns
__label__neu	The idea is good,  put your sleeping baby from the car to the house without the baby waking.
__label__pos	 I could adjust the suction, and my breasts were healing from my son's poor nursing
__label__pos	As a side note, my science minded daughter has already claimed the iQ24 for use in science projects since she knows that it can also be used to sterilize lab equipment and Petri Dishes.
__label__pos	This fit the bill.
__label__neu	"""It's CLEARLY stated it can NOT be used for sleeping, remember that."""
__label__neg	) in another room
__label__pos	"""he was always scared of the tub before..."""
__label__pos	It doesn't have video, but it has all the rest.
__label__pos	"Now we have the ""iQ24 Steam Sterilizer"" which drastically simplifies the sterilization process."
__label__pos	This worked perfectly.
__label__pos	I was so excited when I recieved this tub thinking it would last for years
__label__neg	It is rechargable, but Phillips had to send me a replacement because battery life was terrible and the replacement isn't any better.
__label__pos	I bought a different brand for my first child and it is light as a feather....
__label__neg	 I don't think I'll try again at a later date -- even older babes are still too young to be trusted to react correctly when a leg goes too far in
__label__pos	"""My first daughter loved the swing so I figured this would be a good investment."""
__label__pos	"""By 4 months she was would stay and play for an hour or more..."""
__label__pos	It comes with bags for everything.
__label__pos	"""He fusses way more in the evenflo and just looks so uncomfortable while he is sleeping in it."""
__label__pos	The fabric quality is excellent and I like the fact that I could secure it behind my neck very easily so it wouldn't fall and I could still see my baby's face while nursing.
__label__neg	Got sick of washing all those parts!
__label__neg	 This monitor makes me crazy listening to static all day & all night
__label__pos	"""But the boppy is nice for keeping the baby upright after feedings, and for tummy time too."""
__label__neu	I don't use the sling anymore but it wasn't a problem when we did.
__label__neg	I will never go back to Medela. 
__label__pos	"""Tying it is also a breeze - I did it the first time and it was so easy."""
__label__pos	Now she is four months old and loves to spend time in it and grab at the toys
__label__pos	The mobile is cute and the sounds are soothing. 
__label__neg	This was okay- I like that it's all one piece,  but my daughter didn't like it at all
__label__neg	 Warmers are meant to just take the chill out of the wipes but this one didnt do that very well
__label__pos	"""Great!"""
__label__neu	This becomes a choking hazard.
__label__neu	This is just a few wooden discs tied via a rubber band.
__label__neg	But we got sick of putting him in a snowsuit or covering him with 3 or 4 blankets.
__label__pos	So - if you eat a huge meal, I guess it wont work for you, but your average sandwich, chips, fruit and/or cookie plus napkin fits in just fine.
__label__neg	First, it is really expensive for a body pillow, but I figured Boppy would not steer me wrong. 
__label__neu	I used it for a few more weeks after that, until she started turning her head a lot more at night & started sitting up.
__label__neu	we want to as well.
__label__neg	 I found a little tear in the clear plastic underside of the handle
__label__neu	My son has never liked this toy.
__label__pos	"""The second I gave it to him he started jabbering at it and trying to get the whole thing in his mouth."""
__label__pos	But the most important reviewer is my 7-month-old -- he loves it and smiles every time we strap him in.
__label__pos	The best part about them is that I discovered (sort of a 'duh' moment) that you can, in fact, detach the string from the plastic creature and wind it through the same way on the rings of his Playtex pacifiers. 
__label__neu	You will notice the difference in a few weeks. 
__label__neu	The nipples,  on the Avent,  are too long and hard and would make her gag when she attempted to latch on.
__label__neu	On the other hand though,  I have had some interference with this monitor picking up some phone conversations in the neighborhood
__label__neg	 There shouldn't be anything dangerous in there anyway
__label__pos	"""We purchased it because it was well rated and we like it."""
__label__neg	I really want to use this sling, but I feel like he's either too deeply inside the sling and he will suffocate or by adding a blanket underneath him, he's too close to the edge and will tumble out.
__label__pos	"""i purchased this exersaucer for my 4 month old daughter and she absolutely loves it!"""
__label__neu	She can almost sit on her own but still falls over occasionally.
__label__pos	"""It also has a plug on the bottom which makes it easy to empty."""
__label__neu	I keep thinking he's just too small and is getting lost in it, but even as he grows I am still trying to make him more comfortable by adding a blanket to position him better.
__label__neg	Not like me 4 sets later :o(
__label__neg	This pricey little item is probably the worst bottle we've ever tried
__label__neg	I threw it away after one use.
__label__pos	This thing is great
__label__neu	This is the same product that sells for $40 more from other vendors on Amazon. 
__label__pos	Now when she is older and heavier, this one is the perfect carrier. 
__label__pos	I also think it's very pretty - it brightened up the room.
__label__neu	The sun shines in through this lower corner.
__label__neg	he hated the nipple on the bottle
__label__neg	I love the tub and sling but I find the shower attachment to be a huge waste of time.
__label__neg	I am afraid to let the baby chew on this as it is made of FDA approved Santoprene. 
__label__neu	The bouncing is gentle and natural, spurred by baby's own movements (though you can gently rock baby to sleep, too).
__label__neg	 Wouldn't purchase again. 
__label__pos	So much fun.
__label__pos	I have washed and dried the sheet and had no problems what-so-ever.
__label__pos	Also, the night feature is excellent  it casts no ambient lighting in the room at all, but works perfectly.
__label__pos	I switched to Platex Ventaire and we both loved them
__label__neg	 The lid is also inconvenient to use - you have to push a button to open and close it each time; no easy flipping like the Dex
__label__pos	 That's the only feature that is absolutely fantastic about it
__label__neu	We were not very diligent on giving her a bottle often so she probably got pretty attached to the breast
__label__pos	Let me tell you a few reasons why this will be the only baby gate we will buy.1.
__label__neg	It just isn't worth it!!!
__label__neu	 Britax is the best but unfortunately there is a design flaw in this seat in the way that the buckle is made.
__label__neg	 I'm only 5'2 and I really have to bend my knees inorder for my legs to be supported by this.
__label__neu	Since she's always wrapped in a blanket she doesn't mind going w/o the sheet.
__label__neu	I think it arrived on my doorstop within just two days of placing the order.
__label__pos	And when done serving the baby's stroller, easily attaches to chair backs or anything with slots to store toys, crayons, kitchen utensils, etc.
__label__neg	Whatever the reason for the breakages, and however much the features may appeal, I don't think 12 months of combined use for two units is what you would call reliable
__label__pos	Good sheet
__label__neg	"""Unfortunately, to cover up that horrible noise, we found we had to turn the volume up way too loud for sleeping purposes."""
__label__neg	The lids don't have a rubber grip or anything,  so I could tell one container might leak
__label__neu	BUT I noticed that the ON/OFF switch SPARKED EVERY TIME you turned it off.
__label__pos	I use it with a large infant tub and my baby is supported wonderfully.
__label__neg	The product looks and functions more or less as expected, well much more like less.
__label__pos	First years makes a better product.
__label__pos	"""This warmer is so fast!"""
__label__neg	 After 3 days up our lock froze in the stuck position. 
__label__neu	I did not have a problem with the smell like others- there was a slight smell when I opened the item, but after washing it and airing out over night, I really didn't notice an odor.
__label__neu	The lights are nice too,  although I like to have the volume on anyways so that I can monitor him better
__label__pos	It is easy to clean and I feel comfortable knowing my child is in a super safe top rated car seat.
__label__neg	 First of all they are extremely bulky which isn't very conducive to a baby learning to crawl and develop their muscles well because it forces their legs so far apart
__label__pos	"""She likes to look at the toys and she likes the rocking motion she makes when she kicks her legs and waves her arms in excitement."""
__label__neg	The downside is the cost of the liners.
__label__pos	I bought the newborn starter set and the infant set and together they are all I require for bottles and a breastmilk storage set!
__label__pos	He sleeps so well in it and he also enjoys playing with the mirror and rattle bar toy.
__label__neu	You still need to have some type of regular bottle.  
__label__neg	We tried attaching the bunny, but she hated that even more.
__label__neg	Couldn't figure out the belly support feature - just didn't help me.  
__label__neg	 It constantly emits static, so that my mom cannot even tell if the sound receiver is off or on
__label__neu	if my son was to be in it - to prevent possible suffocation,  choking
__label__pos	"""It still holds tons of toys and it keeps things looking neat and tidy."""
__label__neu	!
__label__neg	 I only wish they could make a STRONG two tier design one day
__label__neu	There is a small pouch on the side for bottle or sippy cup.
__label__neu	I purchased our papasan from amazon (this page). 
__label__pos	I would definately recommend this!
__label__neu	"Video monitors are a ploy to get well-meaning parents,  eager to protect their children (""if you don't get this,  you're an irresponsible parent!"
__label__neg	It's impossible to snap back together if by some miracle you can change the size.
__label__neu	I RECEIVED THIS SWING AS A BABY SHOWER GIFT. 
__label__neu	This product does not fit all bath tubs
__label__pos	This item is one I have seen time and again on new mom's baby registries. 
__label__neu	Went with Playtex ventaire natural instead.
__label__neg	I have tried it on wood,  metal,  and painted surfaces.
__label__neg	I use it in the tub, and here are my complaints:  First off, I could have just bought a mop bucket, my son always leans forward to chew on toys and gets a face full of water - I have to watch him like a hawk, hands ready to grab him at any moment, the white cushion seat constantly pops up from the bottom, and how am I supposed to clean the baby?
__label__pos	"""Love this frame!"""
__label__neg	I would never buy Advent again.
__label__neg	 My 13 month old holds the top open and spills the contents everywhere. 
__label__pos	It would be nice if they made one that has sides that fold in half for storage, but no one does!
__label__pos	The projection is very clear and the music is nice.  
__label__pos	It's very well designed and I love all the features - especially how cuddly the seat is and the fact that we could also hook in our car seat.
__label__neu	I dropped one of my caps on the ground and snapped the part off that the tube goes over.
__label__neu	"""My son pees standing up like papa anyway."""
__label__neu	"""We exchanged it for a Fisher Price Aquarium Monitor- also terrible, a real waste of money."""
__label__pos	I really love having the mirror!
__label__neg	The kneeler is not very sturdy.
__label__pos	 I complained to avent and although they had good customer service and sent me out a new pump, it did exactly the same thing
__label__neu	We've bought several other brands, all of which were better than this stuff.
__label__pos	With this product, he stays warm all through the night because he can't kick it off.
__label__neu	"""Keeping them in my fridge for those times when I get behind in pumping."""
__label__pos	Anyway I love this darling little girl.
__label__neu	I felt it did not fasten securely to the tub and there wasn't enough cushioning for his head and bottom.
__label__pos	All in all, a highly recommended mobile (any Tiny Love), but if you want to save a few bucks ($10 I think it is), skip the Deluxe version and get the regular one.
__label__pos	She loves to lay down and look at all the colors.
__label__neg	They also don't link together very easily and once together they don't stay together.
__label__neu	Well,  I'm back to using a Diaper Genie,  and my son's room smells just fine.
__label__neg	"""You have to sit there and push the button over and over again."""
__label__neg	I have  a sleigh bed crib and this does not fit the rail
__label__neg	Instead of exchanging it for a fourth time,  I just threw the whole thing out
__label__neg	 I gave it one star because that is the lowest you can give
__label__pos	Seems sturdy items come out clean.
__label__neg	This isn't easy and of course it's wet with formula.
__label__neg	"""The front comes up to the middle of her face."""
__label__neg	This is a piece of garbage. 
__label__neu	The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors.
__label__neg	""" does not mean ""BPA Free""This machine should be ""BPA Free"" it can't be that difficult to remanufacture"
__label__pos	This one was definitely worth the extra money!
__label__neu	Very unappetizing.
__label__pos	For those families like ours with health issues including allergies the humidity and temperature sensors are a definate plus. 
__label__neg	 Really likeBoon Benders - Adaptable Utensils in Orange/Blueas introductory spoon and fork
__label__pos	It's been 5 months aleady and we've had no troubles at all.
__label__neg	There are 3 options for the volume - off medium and loud - I wish there was a quiet option but I haven't seen that on any toys yet
__label__neu	I never dry mine in the dryer
__label__pos	"""The side pockets are perfect for personal stuff and baby's bottles AND mom's water."""
__label__neg	 they're small (27lb) 2yos, so i can't imagine what would happen if they weighed more
__label__pos	I had this one and it worked for all of three months. 
__label__neg	Additionally the case is difficult to carry by the handle (there's no hole) and is not securely closed.
__label__neu	So we purchased a bath tub device that fit into the kitchen sink.
__label__pos	I would highly recommend this item.
__label__neg	I was so disappointed in this crib
__label__pos	 It took about an hour to put together and according to my husband, the instructions were easy to follow and there were no pieces missing
__label__neg	 By the time I had it at an acceptable temp, my baby was already screaming for the bottle
__label__pos	For burp cloths, I prefered the Kooshie baby brand which are very absorbant, very soft and durable as well.
__label__pos	He stays all nice and warm.
__label__neg	I have been much happier with Dr
__label__neg	I bought a pink hand/footprint stamp pad and found that to be much more effective
__label__neu	It was very useful, the only downside being that it wasn't that attractive and things sometimes got under it.  
__label__pos	He's 14 months now and it's in the bathtub.
__label__pos	I have bought this cup over and over again- not because it has worn out, but because I want several for our home, grandparents' home, diaper bag, etc.
__label__neu	It uses a coil to heat and I've heard that these type of heating mechanisms should be unplugged when not in use so that they won't get ruined, but there is an ON/OFF switch on the back of the warmer if you'd rather just use that.  
__label__pos	On a whim i contacted JJ Cole customer service and they WERE AWESOME.
__label__neg	 Don't waste your money - buy another one
__label__neu	I wwasn't sure what all the bad reviews were for.
__label__pos	"""Both are pretty in our cars and I guess I am shallow but I care about that."""
__label__neg	My only complaint is that occassionally my feet will hit the rear wheels when walking.When folded, two wheels end up at the top and two at the bottom.
__label__neg	I bought this tub because i liked the idea of the shower part and roominess of this tub but unfortunately the shower part is useless, i broke within a couple uses and when it did work it was just not worth the extra money
__label__neg	For example, we have theFisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat - Blue, and the bowl does not fit on the tray - it is too large for the tray.
__label__neu	!
__label__neu	All in all,  it was way too much money for the limited use of all of the fancy options that you pay for.
__label__pos	I ordered this to have for 2yr old granddaughter, while it is easy to put together. 
__label__neg	 We only kept the toys that came with it and gave away the tub
__label__neg	This sounded good in theory, but didn't work at all
__label__neu	We purchased two one for the top of the stairs and one for downstairs.
__label__neg	Wish I could give the papasan a better review - but my son gave it a thumbs down
__label__neu	"""It seems like it may stay in place okay anyways though, but haven't used it yet."""
__label__neu	 I tried the First Years that have a zip-loc top and they've worked better
__label__neu	 We can't express how much we LOVE the Dr
__label__pos	Best of all, the bottles are clean and sterilized in four minutes, without boiling water or running a half-full dishwasher.
__label__pos	 **** I finally found a folding cushy potty seat on another website for $15
__label__neg	The cornerstone of Born Free's marketing campaign is that they are BPA free
__label__neu	I have a friend who sews and is going to make me a new cover out of better fabric.
__label__neu	I decided to cut it in half and just use half at a time since my daughter tends to stick to one end of her crib when she sleeps at night.  
__label__neg	 They advised us the us to use shelf liner
__label__neg	Please, I beg you not to waste your money on this product
__label__pos	Plus, having the matt ensures we always have a clean surface for our baby's food, and makes cleaning up and leaving very quick and easy when mealtimes are over.
__label__neu	This pump would be okay for light pumping but not for working moms.
__label__pos	This is awesome because there isn't much time for working around the house with a new baby.This pump also stores quite well in the Avent microwave steam sterilizer.
__label__neu	The same for the trays
__label__neg	99 drugstore mirror and mounted it on the headrest
__label__pos	This playmat has become one of several baby items I couldn't live without! 
__label__pos	"""I too had enough left over to make a handprint which I was happy about :)  I am so glad to have this keepsake of my baby's adorable little foot."""
__label__neu	Besides that, I chose this one because as we were doing our registry, a FATHER came up and told us to get it (no smells, easy to use, compact), with his 2 kids and a pregnant wife.
__label__neu	Bottom line
__label__neu	It took my daughter FOREVER to drink the bottle from the nipples.
__label__neu	In order to get the monitor fully charged you have to let it charge for 3 hours.
__label__neg	 But I am just disappointed I didn't get what was being advertised and cannot return it as it was a gift. 
__label__neu	Still would have liked for a layer of foam against the back, as said above I did my own!
__label__pos	It makes the other playyards look like a joke!
__label__pos	This is a great gift set which includes all their great scents.
__label__pos	"""I know we are going to get our money's worth out of this bouncer."""
__label__pos	BY FAR THE BEST BABY ITEM!!!
__label__neu	At about 7-8 months, the thrill wore off.  
__label__neg	 After reading all the reviews I was very careful in my washing and air dried them
__label__neu	"""I added a few different toys like jacques the peacock and celest - sun/moon toy with a teething star that hung almost to the bottom, and her zebra."""
__label__neg	Got one as a gift and now have to return it
__label__pos	"""He LOVES it."""
__label__pos	 They sent us a new watch free of charge
__label__pos	She can't reach the ground yet but she sits in here for a long time and manipulates the toys.
__label__neu	As your child grows they can be carried facing out to see the world or on your hip for a quick trip into the post office.
__label__pos	Product is great.
__label__neu	i only really used the two brushes rather than the finger brush.
__label__neu	With this in mind it was difficult to find things to keep her entertained.
__label__neu	The nipple shields were not the correct size and I had to buy a different size.
__label__neu	5. All this means the bottles require an all out demonstration & tutorial to a husband, grandmother, babysitter, helpful friend, etc...
__label__neu	I do have to constantly clean her off, however my DD *loves* this little cutie!
__label__pos	It's cute, soft, comfortable and does the job.Some people think that these harnesses are treating your kid like a pet.
__label__pos	"""They can crawl and explore and have fun, and are completely safe."""
__label__pos	"""My husband and I love this baby carrier, but even more important- my 3 month old daughter enjoys it."""
__label__neu	When I was considering what to get, I kept reading about moms who pumped milk and then kept it in storage bags only to have it leak when thawed. 
__label__neu	If you work full time, you may want to buy two sets or even bigger ones. 
__label__neg	"""WRONG."""
__label__pos	I love the fact that my son takes well to these bottles.
__label__neu	my son couldnt care less about this teether.
__label__neg	What a pain.
__label__neu	I thought I would like it because the mirror was so big and it would be easy to see my baby,  but each shift resulted in my baby being out of view.
__label__pos	It suctions around her head perfectly and leaves her face completely dry while completely rinsing her hair.
__label__pos	The toys are just so interactive for babies.
__label__neu	I can be talking quietly in the room and it will set it off.
__label__neu	Maybe that's because I am not used to very thick pillows and it hurt my neck after I tried to sleep on it.
__label__neg	Well,  first you can NOT use it in your home bathtub,  because the suction cups will not adhere to a non-slip surface
__label__neg	I had to buy a replacement part because the bottom part that screws on the base of the pump cracked from sterilizing (which it says you can do). 
__label__neu	This warmer heats from the bottom. 
__label__pos	"""But, it was an alternative and it also kept him from lying down flat."""
__label__pos	I use this to nurse and to play because it is great to put the boppy by my knees and then the baby can see my face and it is easy to get her to smile using the boppy for support.
__label__neu	Now that he is 4 months old he wont sleep in it and wont stay in it very long.
__label__neg	However, the spray button is the biggest PAIN!!!
__label__pos	 At this price, it definitely pays to do your research
__label__neg	This product is a piece of junk
__label__neu	UPDATE
__label__pos	"""I have not had any problems with the tub leaking."""
__label__pos	it's a beautiful toy and there is so much to keep busy hands (and mouths!
__label__neg	"""Friendly Toys Little Playzone Extension KitDrawbacks:"""
__label__neg	This one was just too bulky to carry in her bag
__label__pos	"""This was a necessity (as much as I'd like to say otherwise) and I highly recommend it."""
__label__pos	 Easier to squeeze than Sophie. 
__label__neg	This product is definitely not a neccessity
__label__neu	I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor
__label__neg	I find it pretty hard to open it without breaking a nail and it does get fill up much more quickly than the Decor. 
__label__neu	We initially bought this booster because we were going to be travelling abroad and had no way to get a high chair to where we were going (expensive, and cumbersome).
__label__neg	When this swing arrived at our doorstep after 2 weeks of no sleep, I wept.
__label__neg	 The white paint chips off all over
__label__neu	After checking out all the different kinds of diaper pails we decided to go with this one.
__label__neu	"""And she's on lactofree formula."""
__label__neu	" Here's how it happens: Once the tub is full expanded and the clips under the side are ""clicked"" into place (and yes, we did read the instructions) we fill the tub"
__label__neg	" I am only 5'2"", with a very short abdomen, so maybe the wedge made me sore because it went under my ribs, which were the most tender when I woke up"
__label__neu	My baby is due in 8 weeks and I just set up the cosleeper by myself.
__label__neu	She cried when I took her out of it.
__label__neu	I bought another tub initially - a friend told me about this one
__label__pos	"""The mat saved our upholstery and cleaned up with a damp rag!"""
__label__neu	I bought this because it was nicer looking then others and my husband was concerned with how it would look on him.
__label__neg	com you can get 3 8oz nursers for $5 instead of one for $7.
__label__neu	When I was searching for a mobile for my daughter's crib, I wanted something that would be gender generic and cute.
__label__neu	"Also, I don't feel as if they are as ""hot""."
__label__neg	"""you can find better for cheaper."""
__label__pos	This is a great item for a working mom who has to pump on the go.
__label__neu	I have never had this problem, maybe it was corrected?
__label__neu	I would not recommend buying this item.
__label__neg	At first I really liked these, until I realized that my baby just used about 100 liners in about 1 week
__label__pos	"We purchased the ""First Years Air Flow"" sleep positioner instead and love it"
__label__neu	No twisting or other fancy maneuvers necessary.
__label__neg	Then you can try to cross your leg under the Boppy, until it goes numb, yay.  
__label__pos	I really wish they made muslin blankets for adults (maybe they do?
__label__neg	they are so complicated to put together and they always leak. 
__label__neu	Everyone asked me, what's a Boppy.
__label__neu	I also took a plastic over the door towel hook and hung it from under the tank of our toilet (on the side).
__label__neu	I'm going to try some of the other suggestions of turning the pillow around and using my own pillow for my head and see how that works.
__label__neg	 As a result, the carseat slides from side to side
__label__neu	"""Well."""
__label__pos	My daughter had a hard time falling asleep almost anywhere but in her swing, she LOVES it!
__label__neu	It makes it less messy (especially early on) and doesn't require washing as much
__label__neu	"""We have hard wood floors."""
__label__neu	As I have stated with the trainer set, they are okay if your child takes to them, just don't buy more than one set if you are not sure your child will take it.
__label__neg	A few months later I would have changed my mind and deleted that review when it started getting holes.
__label__neu	Diapers and wipes on the side with room left. 
__label__neg	It is so light that it seems like the baby could easily tip over.
__label__neu	They defrosted overnight and my little one had food for daycare the next day.
__label__neu	At least that's what it looks like to me. 
__label__pos	"""Only advice - tighter is better so tie it as tightly as you can and it'll be so much easier and safer with baby inside."""
__label__neu	Such a mess.
__label__neu	I only had one problem with getting the bottles 2 hot but that was my fault from heating them twice.
__label__neg	We either had to re-heat the bottle or let it cool down before giving it too the baby
__label__pos	"""It was the first toy my son paid any attention to at all, starting around when he was 3 weeks old."""
__label__neg	Oh, well :(
__label__pos	Its great and I HIGHLY reccomend it!
__label__neu	Pass on this and try others.
__label__pos	The nubby raspberry portion soothes gums while it's entire soft texture is easy to hold. 
__label__neu	We lay her on it and she stays much warmer
__label__pos	"""Now he is a little over 6 months old (he was a preemie so he is almost 4 months adjusted) and he still loves it."""
__label__neu	A lot of cherrios do wind up falling out after a while but of course if it had no top they would all fall out in about 10 seconds. 
__label__pos	My little girl loves trying to use this cup.
__label__neu	"I am sure that I can use a straight pin and open them more,  but ""you're not supposed to"
__label__neu	Although now that he's 8 months and very mobile, he doesn't like it so much anymore, he'd rather be free to chase the dogs and throw the dvd's all over the house.
__label__pos	Ok, once its on and done, I love it.
__label__pos	He was able to sleep comfortably, just the same as usual, while we were away from home.
__label__neg	 This left a gap in the rungs wide enough for our son to stick his head through which means he could get past the gate if we kept it up (which of course we didn't
__label__neg	It does not twist correctly. 
__label__neu	I bought these bottles with the hopes that they'd reduce my baby's gas and fussiness.
__label__pos	 I bout the diaper champ and it is the greatest pail ever
__label__neg	DO NOT BUY THESE BLOCKS
__label__neg	I purchased the two pack of this Nuby no spill cup for my 13 month old at the time.
__label__neu	We had it stored for awhile and then brought it out again to use in her high chair.
__label__neu	After he got the hang of feeding himself,  he prefers his regular Gerber or The First Year disposable spoons that he can more easily scoop up food
__label__neu	I wrote a review a few months ago but I have to edit it. 
__label__pos	Doesn't leak and keeps liquid hot or cold.
__label__neg	Bottles don't wear out but nipples do
__label__pos	the pillow is so wonderful that i even have an extra large suitcase that i pack it in when traveling for work.
__label__neg	It shrunk to about 1/4 of it normal size.
__label__neu	Well,  I thought it was an OK product at first
__label__pos	We love our video monitor!
__label__neu	This product is no exception.
__label__pos	"""I am so glad I picked it because it is great!"""
__label__neu	).
__label__neu	If you want a good product buy Fisher Price...never unsatisfied.
__label__neu	Those bottles are a LOT cheaper and SOOOOOOOOOOOO much better
__label__pos	What a lifesaver!!
__label__neg	"We gave these to our 9-month-old twins as their first ""utensil,"" and were very disappointed in the results"
__label__pos	 I chose the Boulevard and I am so happy that I did. 
__label__neg	So,  we were disappointed as soon as we set it up and saw how it works - but it was too late to return the product
__label__pos	"Although I didn't even register for it at first, a friend said it was a ""must-have"", and boy, was she right!  "
__label__pos	"""I have two of them and find myself using them all the time."""
__label__pos	So nice, even sleeping in it is easy.
__label__neg	Once you open the bag it is no longer sterile.
__label__neu	Buy the sponge - it is a couple of bucks and really all you need,  in my opinion.
__label__pos	I cannot imagine why anyone would choose a full- size high chair over this little gem!
__label__neg	If the ceiling fan, air conditioner, or air purifier are on, you hear static. 
__label__neu	Now, at 5 months, he can grab at the toys and hit the keys.
__label__pos	I used these bottles and had no problems whatsoever.
__label__neu	I store them in a locked cabinet and then when I cook I just put them back on then remove them when Im done.
__label__neg	The first two were broken and the basket wouldn't hook on and the third one was broken and could not bend in the middle.
__label__neg	IF you can get it to stay on the door,  it works great.
__label__neu	We received this monitor as a gift and did not open the monitor until a couple of months after the baby arrived. 
__label__neg	For the price,  Medela should really come up with something better
__label__neu	There is no need to transfer to a storage baggie thing and there is little or no chance that they will leak. 
__label__neu	No special bags to buy.
__label__pos	It actually works.
__label__pos	When we take him out of the car into the elements, we zip it up all the way and use the loose flap at the top to hold up with the car seat handle, so he is covered and protected from wind/snow/rain, but not smothered. 
__label__pos	4 1/2 stars
__label__pos	 We used it fine with our newborn for a while, I actually loved it
__label__neu	MiPump by First years. 
__label__pos	My toddler can easy fall asleep even faster than in Britax. 
__label__neg	It does not seem safe at all.
__label__pos	 Its quite easy to remove the diapers from the product
__label__neu	I've never not had one on hand,  with 3 total
__label__neu	He is my Mom's 1 year old foster child who she is in the process of adopting.
__label__neu	While the Avent system is good, I love the presterilized drop-in disposable liners.
__label__pos	I would say that this item is definately worth the money!
__label__neg	It could include a scissor.However when we first opened the hard plastic case, half of the contents fell out, since they are not secured inside it.
__label__neg	"They are NOT the ""best"" bottles to use while breastfeeding"
__label__pos	It is one of the few things I would not want to live without.
__label__pos	"""it is easy to wash and carry around!"""
__label__neg	He never liked it
__label__pos	The large handles on the items (especially the clippers and scissors) are very handy so that you don't have to worry about slipping and accidentally cutting your squirming newborn while trying to do those ever-important nail trimmings.
__label__neg	Only negative is it is a lot of fabric and I really heat up quick in moderate weather.
__label__pos	We were very happy with this stroller and glad to find one that worked well with the Chicco Keyfit.
__label__pos	"""They are easy to rinse off and wipe dry, so they are ideal for restaurants."""
__label__neu	I buy the Especially for Baby wipes in the big box.
__label__pos	And the back pockets are FANTASTIC
__label__neu	We thought about bringing the bumbo but didn't want to have to put him on the floor to feed.My son was 4 months, had been sitting up for a bit and enjoyed sitting and eating mushy foods.PROS: Very easy to clean.
__label__pos	Update: I have recently found two alternatives of this same concept that have worked out well
__label__pos	No air in belly, price is not over the top, nipples are the best I have found, and very well made (no leaks at all)
__label__neu	This bath pillow elevates the head of the baby while giving her a lot of support throughout the body. 
__label__pos	Most other playyards are dark and the mesh is dark so your baby can't see out and therefore wants to get out asap.
__label__pos	I LOVE my Boppy!
__label__pos	My son is now 4 months old, and so far it is working great. 
__label__pos	The kid just loves baths I should add.
__label__neu	Being somewhat paranoid about germs when we had our first child, we were ultra careful with sterilizing EVERYTHING.
__label__neg	Second, the wipes are cold again about a second after you remove them from the container.  
__label__pos	My eight month old hits himself in the face with most of his toys and this has not been a problem with the step and play.
__label__neg	Since the bassinet is 3/4 the pad folds up and the sheet doesn't stay put very well at all. 
__label__neg	I would recommend trying a different brand.
__label__neu	The new oval version does not work as well, also get the smaller size model -the dekor not the dekor plus.-
__label__neg	He has to stand up and then I struggle to get him to sit down again.
__label__pos	I would recommend this pump to anyone and love that it is more green and can safely be reused by others.
__label__neg	They close at 3pm pacific time and they are on the west coast,  as are we
__label__pos	It is really fun watching her jump around in this.
__label__pos	Now my husband can feed him when he gets home from work.
__label__neu	My mother- in- law keeps offering to buy me a high chair and I tell her the honest truth.
__label__neg	This one is a total waste of plastic. 
__label__pos	My sons gums are sore but he is not really teething yet so as of yet this item provides good entertainment, he loves shaking it about.
__label__pos	 After using some other brands of bottle brush, I'm going to give this one 4 stars. 
__label__neg	I understand that some people might have a problem with this bottle type.
__label__neu	I figured at that price they were worth a shot.
__label__pos	Flimsy arm rests
__label__neu	Good luck if you get the bag.
__label__neg	The washing label requests that these sheets be air-dryed (possibly b/c of all the velcro?).
__label__pos	It also cuts down on the wasted breast milk since I pump right into what she feeds from.
__label__pos	This is the perfect bath for an infant. 
__label__neg	I understand the theory behind this product but it needs works before it's a real benefit and must have item
__label__pos	I read the amazon reviews and couldn't wait to get Sophie. 
__label__pos	They worked great.
__label__neu	Got these for my son who loves bath time
__label__pos	There is lots of room for them to play with each other.
__label__neu	You can use that as a diaper bag
__label__neu	Plus,  when I take a shower or fold laundry I just put him in the chair and take him into the bathroom or laundry room with me
__label__neu	Hard to find item...
__label__pos	"""Its wonderful!"""
__label__pos	Also, I have put the bottles together many times with them still wet and have had no problems.
__label__pos	She really liked it and it was a saver as we used it for a feeding chair,  entertainment center with the toys and a napping seat
__label__neg	 Now I will have 8 bottles with 6 nipples, which will probably just end up clogging again. 
__label__pos	"""The fish really keep his attention."""
__label__pos	This thermometer works much better and quicker than the hospital thermometers I recieved.
__label__neg	It just doesn't have any back support. 
__label__pos	"""My baby usually falls asleep while I carry her around in this when in the stores."""
__label__pos	The tub is a great size -- not too large to store and fits in most standard sinks (I have a 1 1/2 size sink).
__label__neu	(see my review)
__label__pos	I'm an average size and this fits me perfectly.
__label__pos	I would say of all of our baby gear purchases this was the best!
__label__neg	 a real pain in the neck. 
__label__pos	She pushes the buttons and plays with it all the time.
__label__neu	And my son is really long. 
__label__pos	Where his tail would be he has a couple teething loops which are great for baby's gums.
__label__neg	 The drop-in liner idea is great and does reduce air bubbles, but I can't afford to pay for new nipples every 2 weeks.
__label__pos	My wife chose Avent on recommendation from a friend and we glad we did.
__label__neu	These bottles are an example of one-way vents - the base is designed to let air flow in but prevent fluid from flowing out in the opposite direction
__label__pos	"""My baby rarely even has to be burped after eating with these, and I love that there's never built up pressure in the bottle."""
__label__neu	I keep this in the bathroom at all times.
__label__neg	Even changing stations didn't help- we still picked up the sounds from their monitor AND even more static
__label__pos	"""Recommend it."""
__label__pos	(altho her other rattles are certainly more effective, she does like to stop chewing and shake it, which is better than dropping it like she does with other teethers)The plastic case is a nice touch, too, keeps it clean if it falls into the dark depths of the diaper bag.
__label__neg	There is no traction on this mat.
__label__neu	"""I used this for a short time."""
__label__pos	This has really helped our transition to getting our son into his own room at night!
__label__neg	My baby will NOT stay wrapped up in this
__label__neg	Now we're practicing Elimination Communication (readDiaper Free: The Gentle Wisdom of Natural Infant Hygiene) and make sure he pees before he's on the changing table, but these were a total waste of money.
__label__neu	"""I travel to Indiana because my younger sister lives there."""
__label__neu	What we really need is functionality and usability and this warmer is neither.
__label__pos	"One of the few ""must haves"" that I really believe in."
__label__neg	I suppose it's okay for a fabric-covered seat or for  a small car that doesn't have fold-down rear seats, but for an SUV or minivan it's really not usable.
__label__neu	These are the only bottles my 8 week old will drink from.
__label__neg	 It's really hard to do all of that when you are out with your baby!
__label__neg	Though we can straighten it out, it requires constant attention and re-laying.  
__label__neu	Buy any Medela pump instead.
__label__pos	"""The rotating mobile is adorable and keeps him entertained whenever I turn it on."""
__label__pos	thought I would get dependent on it and wouldn't know what to do if it wasn't around.
__label__neu	Since I can't get it off,  I use a bottle brush and a toothpick to clean what I can't reach.
__label__pos	No problems at all
__label__neu	I never wore it on my back.
__label__pos	This one doesn't leak unless my daughter drops it and it stays there for some time, and even then it just leaks a little bit.
__label__pos	"""Washable, lightweight, quick-drying, great for home, restaurants, travel."""
__label__pos	Highly recommended.
__label__pos	I don't mind too much since our daughter has so much fun and that's what really matters!
__label__pos	My daughter loves being in her swing.
__label__neu	I would rather scrub regular bottles.
__label__neg	It goes through batteries like crazy.
__label__neu	We still get reception when on the 1st floor at the opposite end of the house.  
__label__neu	I'm not satisfied with Madela pump in style!
__label__neg	My daughter is now 3 months old and has fallen out of this about 4 times. 
__label__pos	It is also the perfect angle for Dad to feed baby while laying on the couch watching football. 
__label__pos	Colors and decoration are fun and keeps my baby busy and happy
__label__neu	First,  it doesn't have much elevation for newborns.
__label__neu	They achieve exactly what I need them to in all areas.
__label__neg	He's not the least bit interested in it,  and I've shown him that the legs make sounds
__label__pos	"""I'm really glad I got them."""
__label__neg	 But why waste money on a cup holder that will only hold some of the drinks you take along? 
__label__neu	The only thing keeping me from rating 5 stars is the battery.
__label__pos	It is quick, easy to use, and fits other brands as well.
__label__neg	I returned this set because I kept the first set and was terribly dissapointed
__label__neu	"""If you love these bottles, you've love the milkmate ones as well."""
__label__pos	It's wonderful!
__label__neg	Don't waste your time with this version.  
__label__neg	 I returned and bought him a reclining seat with a higher back.
__label__pos	"""I was afraid a couple would fit loose, but all fit snug."""
__label__pos	"""I save $10 and bought it at Target ($39.99)."""
__label__neu	 When there are so many safe covers (the ones that are elastic and go over the car seat, but not under the baby-- for example the Eddie Bauer Carrier Cover, which is what we ended up with), why take the chance? 
__label__neg	"""It's also made of a thick t-shirt like material and made me and my son hot."""
__label__neg	Only reason i didn't give it a five star was that the food cup in the bug comes off way too easily.
__label__neu	This is not just for pregnant women.
__label__neg	 The seat is pretty and uses good fabric but overall this item is not really worth paying its price
__label__neg	My only complaint is that there is not a lot of padding on the seat and it felt really uncomfortable.
__label__pos	I would use them all over again and would use avent with my next baby too.
__label__pos	Great product, baby loves it, and my sister-in-law mistook it for a family heirloom.
__label__neg	For the price I wasn't happy
__label__pos	We removed the net (very easy to remove!) when we realized that he could care less about the lights.
__label__pos	"""With my first daughter I was constantly having to take her out of her snow suit and then put it back on her when we got to where ever we were going."""
__label__neu	We bought this gate, primarily, to keep the dog and cats out of the baby room.  
__label__pos	"""I have to say, my baby loves looking up at it & enjoys the music."""
__label__neg	I don't like this basket
__label__neg	 I suggest renting a hospital grade pump
__label__neu	that's both me and my daughter
__label__neu	I talked to one lady who said that she had already had 3 returned that morning
__label__neu	 We used it about a year with our second child. 
__label__neu	It was easy to undo and attach,  it was super quick through the security lines & I have no complaints except for the cost of the thing
__label__pos	"""He also likes the sounds they make and the different textures."""
__label__neg	 My daughters are only 3
__label__neg	 We lived in an apartment complex on the second floor, so it was crazy to drag him and teh stroller down stairs
__label__pos	"""This is the BEST crib sheet out there!"""
__label__neu	Even with putting absorbant materieal on top of this to try and protect it,  she still spit up right through it.
__label__neu	But unfortunately I think we are now done with it unless we have a new baby or maybe for the fall in the stroller.
__label__neu	I used these through out my daughter's infancy, largely because I bought a whole set of them, the milk storage contraptions, the breast pump, and the pacifiers
__label__pos	 On the plus side
__label__neu	Needless to say she unswaddled herself easily and could not sleep as a result.
__label__neg	I had to buy longer toys to get my child interested in it enough to try to reach for the others, but he would freak out when the bar flopped out of useable reach. 
__label__neg	The suction cups do not stick to anything in a bathroom that's tile
__label__neu	However,  it is only ever mentioned in small print on the box that the adapter does not work with Avent and First Years pumps.
__label__neg	Didn't last
__label__neu	It has too much cushion,  causing too much give in the event of an accident.
__label__neu	It has 2 layers, the cotton quilted layer and a separate VINYL waterproof layer.
__label__pos	It's great and I love it
__label__pos	Once I started using a Medela Electric pump, I got tons of milk! 
__label__pos	It is more mint colored and the beige trim highlights it rather than making it look a little like a bandage (as I think the picture online does
__label__neg	 The waves and water sound horrible and my son never liked listening to the music or the heartbeat sound.
__label__neu	It would have been helpful if it had WORKED
__label__pos	Being a first time mom I didn't realize that you have to wait when they are newwborns to put it in swing motion (I wondered why it went so fast) as they are too light still and it goes pretty fast.
__label__neu	the problem is
__label__neu	It just remained cold
__label__neu	"""You get a little interferrence now and then but I'm sure thats normal."""
__label__pos	"""Slap this carrier on and you can do anything!"""
__label__pos	My 3rd has bad gas & reflux she also wasn't digesting her food properly our doctor suggested Dr Brown's and I was hesitant at first simply because I did not want to wash all those extra parts.
__label__neg	"""No serious injuries to him, but he did get a bunch of scratches from the sharp seam on that arm."""
__label__neg	 While I'm happy that the seat works - I hate it because I still need to clean things up when my kid gets off the seat. 
__label__pos	We recently used this lap tray on a trip and we were pleased with the results
__label__neg	 Brown's instead
__label__neg	 They were correctly installed by my husband, but the magnet is just not strong enough to get it to open
__label__neu	We live in a small house and really bought this for when we are outside. 
__label__pos	I had been having hip pain while sleeping at night and this little jobby did the trick.
__label__pos	The bottle itself is fine
__label__neu	So when we found out we were having twins i ran out and bought 2 of them.
__label__pos	My daughter could easily drink from this cup on the first try.
__label__neg	 I sent this back the exact same day, because its a piece of junk.
__label__neu	It looks really nice in my nursery nicer than just a refillable box of Pampers wipes or something but not worth the money to use just like this.
__label__pos	It's made of a sturdy material that won't rip when handled by the airport security and being thrown around after check-in.
__label__neg	"""But I returned it soon after I bought it."""
__label__neu	I had to wait a few seconds before touching him with the wipe.
__label__neg	"""It is definitely hard to get the velcro fastened around our tiny 2 month old."""
__label__neg	 Then, there was so much static I couldn't sleep, and I couldn't hear the baby clearly
__label__neu	It really a disgusting baby poop green!.  Believe me,  I am not all that into style but I thought that it looked modern and neutral in the picture and would be a little less loud than the others but eeew[...]
__label__neu	 So I washed it, in cold water and didn't put it in the dryer. 
__label__neg	but I was SOOOO disappointed to find that these did not come with the yellow half circle things that make these connectors work with the shields
__label__neg	 I found that when using other brands of brush, I went through soap much more quickly. 
__label__neg	But this is a minor issue.
__label__neu	I leave the legs out because it's the arms that cause the waking.
__label__neu	I have resorted to using my grocery bags for the smelly diapers and wrapping them to throw in the main garbage.
__label__pos	The lights and sounds hold her interest which is particularly nice after she's had a full night's sleep as is waiting patiently for her bottle. 
__label__neg	The product works well,  in theory.
__label__neu	The timings really should be precise.
__label__neu	I imagine I will use it on days that I have to be out of the office during my usual pumping time, as I'm not about to lug the pump-in-style to court.
__label__neu	Finally,  after reading great online reviews I bought the Eurobath.
__label__neg	Save your money,  do not buy this product,  because it will break after few months
__label__pos	"""Just when I was starting to feel desperate for him to have some fun on his own, I turned on this mobile and bingo!"""
__label__neg	The foot is suppose to honk and stopped honking after one month of light play as child was only 3 months old.
__label__neg	 It seemed like a good idea, but the quality leaves a lot to be desired, and the design, for whatever reason, isn't working out for us.
__label__neg	Looks like it would have been a good product if it worked for us,  though.
__label__neu	A good stretch of time for baby growing into different stages of life.
__label__neu	I chose this tub because the sling holds infants up to 16 pounds.
__label__neg	 The heartbeat was loud and annoying. 
__label__neu	Save your eight dollars and just take off the knobs for a while.
__label__neg	"""If I could give it 0 stars I would."""
__label__neg	The plastic case is awful
__label__neg	 The legs are exactly the size that can block airways
__label__pos	This diaper pail is excellent.
__label__neu	Trust me they figure out how to get them out of the outlets.  
__label__neg	If you put it in the warmer with the cap on,   the cap will fill with formula
__label__neu	I got this one because I liked the napper concept. 
__label__pos	 I also have the Regent which is another fantastic seat and I would highly recommend that seat to anyone with room in their car (because it is huge) and with a child over the age of 1 - it is forward facing only. 
__label__neu	I have to admit there is a lot going on for batteries.
__label__pos	Great tub
__label__pos	this is a good toilet ring,  but ONLY if you have the smallest,  round toilet seats
__label__neu	However, if your high chair has a smaller tray, this bowl will not fit.
__label__neu	If it gets gooky though,  (has not over several months) I will just do a vinegar rinse and -voila-.
__label__neg	 The dropper is TOO BIG
__label__neu	"""Now, as the child grows older and the need rises for these products, i.e. strollers, car-seats, etc., does this product is still needed?"""
__label__neg	"There was also a loose string coming off the backpack when it arrived that caused a ""run"" immediately"
__label__pos	"""This pillow keeps my son safe and comfortable, it dries up really well and he can also lie in it on the bathroom floor while I fill the tub."""
__label__neg	I do use it at times when I don't have to also deal with my toddler but the physical demands of a three year old require too much movement to safely use the sling.
__label__neu	They are not the same
__label__neg	My son hates this swing
__label__neu	"The red light,  does not reflect very well and you can't really see it at all on a ceiling or wallsThe constellation of ""stars"" are not really stars,  they are triangles"
__label__pos	My husband and I were ecstatic when we received a Peg Perego travel system for our shower
__label__neg	 but there is nothing to hold it in place on a toilet seat
__label__pos	As I state in the title,  it's cute and does the job
__label__pos	I decided to order one package and when they arrived I was thrilled at how soft they were and looked forward to using them with my new baby.
__label__neu	Baby in 1 hand, dirty diaper in the other, drop diaper in pail, flip bar, diaper is secured in bin.
__label__neg	Why don't they make it so your thumb presses the button like on a sink???
__label__neg	Would have given this 5 stars but this is not as soft as I had hoped...maybe expecting alot from terry cloth.
__label__pos	"""It took her only 15 minutes and no gas pains and very little spitting up!"""
__label__neu	OK,  the inchworm parts make different sounds,  but why
__label__pos	We love it!
__label__pos	"""We're very happy with this high chair."""
__label__neu	Put an Arm & Hammer Baking Soda box at the bottom of the pail to help eliminate orders.
__label__neu	The little storage area is a nice idea but it's rather flimsy and not very supportive.
__label__pos	use this all the time!
__label__neu	If just 10 percent were influenza virus, you could pick up: 510 germs.
__label__pos	"""It keeps him much cooler than laying on a blanket and adds a little bit of a cushion without being squishy."""
__label__neu	I like them because, like I said, they kept the sun out of my son's eyes, but they are an eyesore.
__label__pos	The seat is soft and baby-shaped, the different speeds are great, the music is not annoying at all, the toy bar is cute, the fabric is cozy and attractive, the fold-up legs are so helpful, the small size stays out of the way, the recline is perfect for newborns and sleeping babies, and the battery life is great.
__label__neu	So right now it is in the garbage.
__label__neg	This one however was a dud.
__label__neu	I first used this on a venture to BRU for a Grandparent's Day Breakfast and while Grandma was sitting in on a 529 seminar,  my daughter suddenly discovered that she was beyond famished - so up we go out to the car to warm up a bottle
__label__pos	The pads in the tub are soft and they are mold-resistant.
__label__neu	Otherwise you have to add additional water.
__label__neu	I tried the Bjorn type stool (too small & short to work, too light to stay in place)  the Mommie Cushie stepup (terribly unstable)  and the KidKraft wooden step stool with lid (sturdy, tall enough, heavy enough to stay in place, but might slip on tile, might be slippery when wet, no rails).
__label__neg	 If you like the nipple shape and design the playtex nurser works like a dream with the Multi Flow nipples
__label__neu	end of story
__label__neu	 We returned it
__label__neu	As I got more and more used to breastfeeding,  I just stopped pumping.
__label__pos	Perfect for the Busy Mom
__label__neg	 The twist-tie top causes the bags to freeze with a lot of folds and ridges at the neck - this made it impossible for me to open a frozen bag to add more milk later on
__label__pos	When he was little we'd build towers out of them and he'd knock them down.
__label__pos	The product is sturdy and the design is certainly a wonderful conversation piece. 
__label__neg	There was no way to remove the arm and the seat does not have suction cups on the bottom so we had to return it
__label__pos	these ones i feel the most comfortable giving to her to walk around with to munch on.
__label__neu	We have our crib matress dressed in an additional regular crib sheet underneath with a cheap matress pad below it.
__label__neu	I recieved boxes of these bottles as gifts,  every one of them leaks.
__label__pos	The Diaper Champ TRULY does not contain the odor of diapers at all.
__label__neg	 Whatever food you are serving has to be JUST the right consistency - too thin and it just slides off the dipper, too thick and it won't stick to it
__label__neu	They sliced off a whole chunk of my little guy's thumb this time!
__label__pos	"""I like the kickstand which reclines the chair for extra stability."""
__label__pos	This set really is great.
__label__neg	Not what we needed, and we have stopped using it and folded it away to use for picnics or as a beach throw, we guess.  
__label__neu	We don't use the bubble bath option
__label__neg	It's a big toy for an infant, heavy and not easily dragged around.
__label__neu	I bought the gate because of its angle mount feature.
__label__neg	It isn't always easy to tell if you have it on right until it leaks
__label__neu	Contrary to my normal self, I relented and not only bought the Joovy, but this ultralight version.  
__label__neg	 There is a reason umbrellas and most sun shades don't curve upwards -- the reason is that you don't want to get hit by the sun or rain when you are facing it
__label__pos	 It is very easy to put over my sink. 
__label__neg	 It was really hard to get on and off and not comfortable for her or for me
__label__pos	The great thing is you can remove the top layer when it gets too hot and easily attach it again when it gets cooler in the evenings. 
__label__neg	You'll be continuously wiping it down when it hasn't fallen over that is.
__label__neu	I registered for this and got it home and put it together.
__label__neg	 She is just not interested in it at all
__label__neu	The big selling point is how it keeps the drink cool,  well all but the milk that sits in the spout,  that gets sour quickly.
__label__pos	The size one flow is perfect for my son.
__label__pos	"""Now that my baby has more dexterity, she loves to grab this and chew on it."""
__label__neu	"""),  to spend more money."
__label__neg	I plan on calling the company for some tips in the morning.
__label__pos	"""It's a great support pillow for my baby."""
__label__pos	They stay moist and if you really wanted to you could use a scissor and cut them in half because the sheets are very large.
__label__pos	I don't see how anyone lives without a bouncy seat.
__label__neg	I got it home and cleaned it and started using it and it made my already sore breasts hurt even more (cracking and bleeding) and made my problems even worse.
__label__neg	The only function that I actually used was the cup holders,  which don't work as well as a hard cup holder would
__label__pos	Let's face it no diaper pail is perfect but this one is the best that I've used.
__label__pos	I recommend this bottle rack to all new moms.
__label__pos	No frills mirror, but it has been fabulous for my daughter!
__label__neg	However, I don't like the idea of synthetics to hold in all that moisture right next to my baby's skin. 
__label__pos	Great!
__label__neu	We even broke it down and took it with us on vacation.
__label__neg	I used this with kid#2
__label__pos	this is lovely, with soft music for baby, and even a little night light.
__label__pos	Great Pump
__label__pos	It is a nice size and the versatility of the product is great.
__label__neu	maybe i didn't see it
__label__pos	Now Sophie is her company, and even makes her stop crying. 
__label__pos	It works outside, upstairs and down. 
__label__pos	"My daughter got this for her ""shower"" and she absolutely loved it.  "
__label__pos	"""You can bend it to fit any area."""
__label__neu	I've been waiting 2 months for a new one.
__label__neg	The Dr. Brown's were even worse becasue of the inside pieces.We never really were able to get stable enough to use in the folded position and we were never able to get anyting to hang on the hooks without falling either.
__label__neg	My daughter was fairly young when we tried it (we did some early PT,  and she was about 10 months old).
__label__neu	Also,  the batteries didn't last as long as we would have liked,  but maybe that was because she loves it so much,  we always had to turn it on
__label__neg	I will lay her down and she will go through all three fifteen minutes settings, only fussing if we take to long to start it over.
__label__neg	Also, I couldn't use it in any chair with arms (like a rocker or a dining-table chair because the big fat arms of the Boppy got in the way of the arms of the chair.
__label__pos	Great for diaper storage and such.
__label__neu	He LOVES it
__label__pos	 I have realised my initial assessment was too harsh
__label__neu	So we have been using this potty seat for several months now trying to get our daughter used to going on the potty. 
__label__neg	 I do not recommend this product
__label__neg	If you have a Babies R US near you, I recommend checking out the sets in person.
__label__neg	I have the older model - Hope what they say about the newer model isn't true.
__label__pos	To me, this also justifies the cost.
__label__neg	my clothes would always get soaked if I left them on for more than 3 hours
__label__pos	"""I thought the price was a bit steep for a step stool, but man is it well made!"""
__label__pos	very comfy
__label__neg	not only he didn't like it, it also leaks like crazy. 
__label__pos	Then my wife found this Munchkin inflatable tub which we're using at the present time.
__label__neu	This thing smells,  is a waste of plastic,  and not mommy-easy for when you want to get rid of that dirty diaper while you have a child moving around on the table and only one free hand.
__label__neg	It doesn't work any better than a manual, but it is more convenient since you don't have to work as hard.
__label__neg	However, the stage 1 nipple was way too fast for my baby, and it caused her to spit up nearly everything I had just fed her at every single feeding!
__label__neg	would rather take the time to burp baby then the bottle
__label__neu	We have 3 computers in our home connected to a wireless network. 
__label__neu	"""In addition, it has three little colored lights, or actually, one light with three colors: Yellow is too cool, green is just right and red is too hot."""
__label__pos	It will fit anything that needs to be sterilized, including breast pump accessories. 
__label__neg	 When this does happen, the straps dig into my shoulder
__label__neg	Either way, the baby's butt is inside a chair and difficult to reach or see, much less clean. 
__label__neu	 I don't have a dishwasher so I use it every day. 
__label__neg	I would NEVER buy this again unless I knew they changed the cover & made it more durable. 
__label__neg	Also, these lie flat in the dishwasher, taking up much room. 
__label__neg	 We cuss too much using this one
__label__pos	"""If you have an active child like mine, you will have to go in and out a lot."""
__label__neu	My daughter slept in this bassinet from birth to around 4 or 5 months.
__label__pos	I LOVE this stroller.  
__label__pos	She didn't use it too much for tummy time but I loved the idea of the sturdy block holding it up as opposed to some of the folding tummy time mirrors that just tip over.
__label__neu	Bought this on a whim.
__label__neu	This cup?  
__label__pos	I received this as a Christmas present and my daughter just loves it.
__label__neu	I haven't seen them online, but you can buy them in BRU.
__label__neg	The tiny lip on the nipple does not count as breakthrough technology in preventing the baby from swallowing air
__label__pos	This infant carrier is great.
__label__pos	It has always felt extremely sturdy.
__label__neg	This is the worst
__label__pos	Loved it, but defective
__label__neu	I sat in the nursery opposite side of the room from the monitor and whispered as quietly as I could as my husband walked all over our house.
__label__neg	Also I wish the 'vibrating' bug went up slower.
__label__neu	"""11 oz."""
__label__neu	Boppy Pillows are designed for SKINNY women
__label__neg	There are even times that my older son's pants got wet from resting at the front of the potty when he sat
__label__neu	If your sweet peace is really that loud, then you may consider returning it.
__label__neu	He has even fallen asleep once in it.
__label__neu	I ended up bringing his carseat on with us and using that on the flight back. 
__label__pos	"""The sound quality is excellent."""
__label__neu	"""It's sturdy and attractive and much less expensive than the trendy Tripp Trapp."""
__label__neg	I overcame this by purchasing a rayshade by kiddtopomus for $11.
__label__neg	 My suggestion is to buy the tub that looks like this with out the shower part
__label__pos	Everyone who has used it loves it because there is no fussing with latches or handgrips.
__label__pos	This toy is very nice with great colors textures and a nice clicking noise.
__label__neg	 When the music does play it is extremely loud so we don't even use it after going through all of that trouble
__label__neu	Our daughter never liked it.
__label__pos	The best thing that could help an expectant mother especially during the nights when your sleeping postures are no longer comfortable.
__label__neg	I have also tried the Avent and she got to much ait with those too. 
__label__neu	I've put a dish towel over it to make it more comfortable for me.
__label__neu	My 9 month old daughter just rips it off the table and throws it on the floor
__label__neg	Since both of us drive baby places in our cars we really needed another base.
__label__neg	No valve except the hole in the cup spout
__label__neu	Right now, it sits right at tray level so you either have to squish it or make it stick out above the tray.
__label__pos	The company is great too.
__label__neu	Perhaps wrapping the arms down too far caused this?
__label__neg	It was such a waste and my daughter would get milk all over her chin and neck.
__label__neg	 The fire dept
__label__neu	I guess it doesn't matter anyway since you should ALWAYS check the water temp before putting your little one in it, but I thought it would have been a cool feature had it actually worked.
__label__neu	My suggestion is to take your infant with you to the store before you purchase any of these bouncers/saucers/entertainers.  
__label__neu	REVISION.
__label__pos	This is an EXCELLENT bath tub for my 3 week old.
__label__neu	I bought it. 
__label__pos	Great, Comfy Bouncer
__label__neg	too hot bath water.
__label__pos	This item is wonderful for taking my baby outside for a walk.
__label__neu	Brown's bottles (the narrow ones) screw right into the Pump In Style.
__label__pos	I mostly buy Earth's Best baby food and it fits perfectly.
__label__neg	 I would have returned them but I washed them before I put them on the bassinet
__label__pos	my daughter is small, so it was pretty necessary for her comfort in the highchairs in restaurants and the grocery carts.
__label__neg	We stop four times at different Walmarts along the way (where I purchased the first) and NONE of them worked
__label__pos	I own the ocean wonders aquarium which is still in my older daughters room she still loves that so much she didn't want to pass it on to the new baby.
__label__neg	One thing I do wish it has was a little strech between her legs.
__label__neg	 I was also worried at how hot it got (following the instructions), so we wouldn't heat it for as long as it said
__label__neg	 You have to watch for it to blink or something like that and it only blinks a few times so if u miss it ur gonna sit there for a LOOOONNG time but hey it takes a long time to work anyways. 
__label__neu	Usually we just end up stripping her down to keep food off her clothes.
__label__pos	She has used it for all 3 of our children and the foam hasn't lost it's shape.
__label__neu	I guess I jumped the gun on this review
__label__neg	My 14 month old doesn't like it very much because it annoys her.
__label__neg	The only negative thing thatwe have experienced with these bottles has been that theyhave leaked at times.
__label__neu	Browns bottles.
__label__pos	I have been using the gerber freezer bags instead and I can freeze my milk flat and it thaws much quicker.
__label__neu	Apparently a volume level that might permit us to hear the baby one room away would also cause some sort of massive interference between monitor and reciever.
__label__pos	This sits nicely in our living room.
__label__pos	I no longer have to worry about having bath toys all over the bathroom!  
__label__pos	It was very easy to put together me and my 4yr old did it.
__label__pos	They're still one of his favorite toys!
__label__pos	 old dd is very comfortable sitting in it
__label__neg	The only problems I have had.
__label__pos	I love this set and keep it clipped on my nursery cart.
__label__neg	 They did not grip our leather seats, and actually made the car seat slide around so I took them back, and 3 1/2 years and two more kids later haven't felt like I missed them a bit. 
__label__pos	The idea sounded intriguing so I figured I'd give it a try
__label__pos	This product was a real life-saver for me!
__label__neu	They are also much cheaper as you can generally find them at discount stores (Target,  etc.).
__label__neg	I was worried that the extension would be loose, or threaten the integrity and safety of the gate itself.
__label__neu	Water gets in, but you won't get it out.
__label__neg	"""Also, the music doesn't last long enough and when your baby is too young to pull the cord herself, you constantly have to pull it for the baby."""
__label__pos	"""This one she started playing with right away."""
__label__neu	Tummy time was a nightmare for my daughter from the beginning.  
__label__neu	Most irksome is that the product's packaging intentionally obscures the non-adjustable side so you can't see it's non-adjustable.
__label__neg	It made for a very unhappy baby.
__label__neg	I can only guess that the ones who had leaking problems don't know how to screw a bottle cap on.
__label__neu	!
__label__neg	 I was losing my milk supply fast
__label__neg	"After 12 months, our changing pad has cracks all over the plastic surface of the changing pad, some as big as 2"" in length"
__label__neu	My daughter had to have rice cereal added to her formula and these nipples are clearly marked Stage 1 (Slow flow, formula only for infants) and Stage 2 (Fast flow, for cereal and/or older babies).
__label__neu	 I am going out tomorrow to purchase a new monitor
__label__neu	Brown
__label__neu	Not only that,  but it always took a minimum of 5 minutes to heat the bottle.
__label__neu	We also turn him around so she views the back of Jacques, which is all black and white patterns.
__label__neu	I bought this when my daughter was a month old and had terrible reflux.
__label__neg	 But I was dissappointed that the palm leaves hung down so far
__label__neu	I've unfortunatly had to use this recently for the 1st time.
__label__pos	It's very sturdy and easy to put on the chairs.
__label__neu	First,  I can't get the metal grinding plate off all.
__label__pos	Couldn't be more thrilled.
__label__pos	It was very easy to secure it to the infant car seat canopy.
__label__pos	It's comfortable, easy to use, very sturdy and safe.
__label__pos	"""So glad we got this adapter for our UppaBaby stroller!"""
__label__neu	My son screams waiting for the warmer to get done.
__label__pos	"""That said, the fact that it is so big allows two parents to enjoy giving the bath together to the little one, and allows for the deepness of the water a tradeoff you'll have to decide on."""
__label__pos	I really don't know what I would do without the Rainforest Jumperoo!
__label__neu	If I am going to be out for a while, I usually put him in the stroller b/c I find that to be more convenient.  
__label__neu	Take one look at them and it's pretty clear.
__label__pos	She loves the fact that she can take it off the charger,  and it turns on.
__label__neg	The motor works hard to keep up and the swing would go faster at times then slow way down - which startled my sleeping baby
__label__neu	Never register for an item or buy an item just because you like the pattern and want a matching set, you may end up with something you hate :)
__label__neg	 If you intend to use this cup holder on any sort of sidewalk with any drink that doesn't have a tightly closed lid, it won't work:  Any bounce from the sidewalk, and your drink will spray down the side of the stroller. 
__label__pos	"""I love this bag."""
__label__neu	It didn't take long after bringing home my baby to start noticing the squeek, squeek, squeek when the swing is in motion.
__label__pos	We first bought the elite and we love it
__label__pos	It's wonderful.
__label__neg	"""We have this blanket in 3 of the different fabric choices, and this one in particular shrunk the most in the wash (the fleece is much better, but too warm for Arizona...)."""
__label__neg	I bought two of these undermats and wish I had not
__label__neu	You don't have to have 5 arms or be a contortionist to use it like you do with some of the cheaper carriers.  
__label__pos	He smiles laughs and talks at the light- up star and enjoys batting the toys to make the music come on.
__label__pos	At first we used to fill it with crushed ice but then started putting fruits or veggies in (as mentioned on the packaging) and it works great for that as well.
__label__pos	"""Thanks Leap Frog!"""
__label__pos	"""My daughter is now 6 months and has leaked out of her diaper on occassion, the mattress that she sleeps on cost around $120.00, so thanks to this sheet the mattress still looks the same as it did when we brougt it home."""
__label__pos	In my opinion the cadillac of all swings.
__label__pos	If we're out and he starts to get fussy, all I have to do is pull out the giraffe and squeak it and he'll smile and reach for it.  
__label__neu	I found this warmer to be more of a hasssle than anything.
__label__neg	the reason i took one star away is that on each arm there are 3 shapes that slide around, making too much sound for my daughter.
__label__pos	I love that I never need to take a thick blanket with me, although I'd reccomend taking a receiving blanket (or a thick blanket for colder climates) in the diaper bag so your baby can be warm once you get him out of the bundle me blanket.
__label__neu	This alone would have sold me on this potty.
__label__neg	It tends to show dirt quickly so it gets washed a lot.  
__label__neu	"""Sure, the swing doesn't move very fast, but I don't think my son is quite ready for roller coaster speeds just yet."""
__label__neg	 Please don't buy this one
__label__pos	 We ended up going with Sony's baby call monitor and LOVE it
__label__pos	Originally I wanted one of the more decorative hampers but I am glad I went with this one.
__label__pos	This chair made my daughter feels eating out as comfortable as eating at home.
__label__neg	I don't recommend this product for a cabinet you really want to keep secure.
__label__pos	"""While one does not need to purchase the BF bottle brush (Munchkin's is more than adequate - better even - at $3 or so), I've found the nipple brush is very useful."""
__label__pos	I only wish that we'd found this one earlier
__label__pos	"""Its really easy to adjust between users, I read that some people have trouble with that, but we haven't had any problems & we both use it regularly."""
__label__neu	Our queen size bed is getting crowded so we thought we'd try the cosleeper this time.
__label__neu	39
__label__neu	 He is normal height and weight, but has a longer upper body (like me!)  I bought this thinking that since you can adjust the height, it would work. 
__label__pos	It works fine.
__label__pos	I liked all the accessories the package came with such as sample nipple cream, breast pads, and bottles. 
__label__neu	If you had to choose between the swing or this due to money or space,  I'd choose the swing.
__label__neu	 Brown's
__label__pos	This is really easy to clean to. 
__label__neg	This is not a horrible product.
__label__pos	Nice bibs.
__label__neg	Personally, I HATE these wipes. 
__label__neu	This keeps her warm all night
__label__neg	"""Fabric blew out in seemingly non-load-bearing place, which is strange."""
__label__neg	Well, I didn't think it would be that tiring. 
__label__neu	Put this one on first and then the other one on over top.
__label__neg	I went ahead and kept this but we'll be using it a year from now when he's 2! 
__label__neu	It has two seat positions.  
__label__neg	Well,  sometimes that works and sometimes it dosen't
__label__pos	My daughter was born in July and I liked the idea of her napping in it on our porch with the netting all zipped up
__label__neg	The tabs that 'lock' the tray onto the front piece strip out way too easily and the tray is pretty useless at that point. 
__label__neg	After only a few uses and washes, this pad cover started to tear
__label__neu	i'm still bf so i dont know how it would go with bottles and fomula, but i'm sure it wont be a problem.
__label__neu	Go figure...
__label__neu	 She has a kick and play bouncer... 
__label__neg	Yeah it has a design similar to Avent but trust me there is a reason why this product only costs $20 its junk.
__label__pos	Have had one of these for a long time
__label__pos	My baby burps right away and is never gassy.
__label__pos	Our son loves this play mat and plays with it almost every day.
__label__neu	Well I thought I was done with it and sold it.
__label__neg	I'd suggest buying an individual bottle to try it out first
__label__neu	and usually falls asleep in it.
__label__neu	It appeared as if the only difference was size - slightly smaller - and the lack of a foot pedal
__label__neu	If you're heating expressed breastmilk I can see why someone would need a bottle warmer.
__label__pos	"""There is plenty of room for her toys."""
__label__neu	This one uses regular bags (I use 32 gallon bags).
__label__neu	Also a few of my knobs pull off easily
__label__neu	No more peeing off the front of the potty and no flimsy detachable splash guards that flip down into the seat.
__label__neg	Save the money. 
__label__pos	It really helps her with teething because she loves to chew on it.
__label__neg	!00% would not recommend it.
__label__pos	 Well, the first part was right, it's a cute frog
__label__pos	I love the size of these bowls!
__label__neg	They need to have a better design to lock the tray into place.
__label__neu	and they enjoyed that.
__label__neg	It's way too small.
__label__neg	However,  the less-used one recently split at the seams
__label__neg	 My current advice
__label__neg	I'm sure this would be great for an older child, for travel, or being out and about, but for trying to hold a small baby while doing chores around the house (or anything else, for that matter), this one's a no-go.
__label__neu	It seemed like as soon as we got him to sleep he'd wake himself up again.
__label__pos	But once I figured it out, it works fine.This item works for jars only, by the way.
__label__pos	"""Nice thing as well is that the stroller will fold with no problems while the adapter is attached."""
__label__pos	"""It is very thick and sturdy, and the car seat does not slide when placed on it."""
__label__pos	"""But Avent bottles were AWFUL."""
__label__neu	I just received this item as a baby shower gift, so my review is somewhate limited since I haven't actually used it yet!
__label__neu	We bought this for a trip I was taking by myself with my large, 34 inch tall 16 month old. 
__label__neu	Perhaps this product is good for a stroller?
__label__pos	"""It seems like it would have been perfect to bathe an infant too (since it has the special design to do so), but I didn't have it at the time."""
__label__neu	When my daughter first came home I used them under her, on my counter near the sink to sponge bathe her.
__label__pos	The best are the green stars.
__label__pos	It's adorable,  I just can't use it
__label__pos	It's especially soothing when you put it in the fridge for a while first.
__label__neu	"""Sometimes our baby reaches for the bowl and I have to hold it instead."""
__label__neu	It's fairly compact if you take the time to roll it up into its built-in pouch
__label__neg	Sold mine on ebay.
__label__neu	I have no plans of using it or giving it away.
__label__pos	A definate improvement.
__label__neg	 Money doesn't always buy quality
__label__neu	Then when your child is old enough just put them back on.
__label__pos	 My baby really liked the sounds and the night light was great for midnight feedings
__label__neg	Use of this as a baby support is okay, better than a regular pillow, though in a pinch rolled up blankets work fine
__label__neu	I have read some reviews where people complain about the sun shade not fairing well in the wind but I have not had that problem. 
__label__pos	I chose this one because it works all all types of bottles and I like the spinning feature.  
__label__neg	 In the one case that I actually got the cover on, I could not get it off
__label__neg	 Unfortunately we had the old version
__label__pos	It is so easy to use and the tray slides easily with one hand.
__label__neg	I bath baby in no time and I have the water running because he loves the feel of water streaming down onto his body.
__label__pos	My 72 year old mother in law blew this up at the beach with no problems once I showed her the valve trick!
__label__pos	It seems to really soothe him whenever he is fussy and he just really enjoys all of the movement and sound.  
__label__neg	It has strings hanging all over it.
__label__neu	He was drowning in milk.
__label__neg	 And the bag get a bit costly after a while
__label__pos	I wish I could say they were too small but I have found them to be the perfect size for smaller women A-B cups.
__label__neg	The cow should be for the baby, not the parents to look at!
__label__pos	My daughter is glued to it.
__label__neu	There are several songs so you don't hear the same thing over and over.
__label__neu	That said,  this thing annoyed my husband and I so much,  we cursed it almost daily!
__label__pos	In the end,  I bought another one of these
__label__neg	For me these were a waste of money. 
__label__pos	I have a hefty 6 month old (22lbs) that is comfortable in the chair.
__label__neu	It's very large, so plenty of room for his books.  
__label__neu	"""Our son spilled a milk shake in the car and it dripped through the car seat onto the mat."""
__label__neg	My son really likes this cup, but I found out it is made of polycarbonate plastic, which is known to be toxic
__label__neg	I've used this tub since my baby was born 6 months ago.
__label__pos	"""TRY KOOSHIES,  YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!!!"""
__label__pos	You simply press the timer for a diaper change, feeding, and for sleep.
__label__pos	It works very well in my 35 story 2K apartment complex in the middle Manhattan. 
__label__neg	 My son goes through tons of bottles a day and its not convenient to sterilize them in this item
__label__neu	I ended up throwing away the rest of the box!!!
__label__neg	 This hand pump is not worth the money
__label__neu	We played with this toy some
__label__neg	 Had to throw ours away after a couple of uses (we purchased this before we knew it had BPA)
__label__neu	This tub is okay,  but not the best there is.
__label__neg	"""After just one day of using this I decided to pack it up and return it."""
__label__neg	So when she pees, it gets in between the potty ring and the toilet seat and makes a big mess.
__label__neg	I quickly gave them up.
__label__pos	The velour fabric incredibly soft for my newborn (unlike the stiff cotton of the other one).
__label__neg	By the time he was really ready to be in a tub, we placed him on the teddy bear sponge you place in the bottom of a regular tub, which he enjoyed much better.
__label__neg	This also makes it really ineffective as a reward for the child b/c it will play music for my daughter without her doing anything in it
__label__neu	"""We orignially registered for and received the Diaper Genie and had problems with it from the day our son came home from the hospital."""
__label__neg	One note because the supports don't cross the way some others do he has been able to hook his legs around a support and fold himself up inside the mat - it didn't hurt or even scare him but it would be a risk if he'd been unsupervised.
__label__neg	WRONG
__label__neu	"So I bought it ""for her"". "
__label__neu	Given the amount of time it takes to pump milk, to loose it to leaking bags is terrible. 
__label__neg	"""Dont poison your child with these toxins."""
__label__neg	This product is more difficult to use and less secure.
__label__neu	We just purchased this farmyard for our 3rd floor use so we did not have to lug PPJ up all those stairs.
__label__neg	Yes,  the top drips a little
__label__neu	I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews and this is the first baby carrier I decided to buy
__label__neg	 The thermometer claims to take quick temp
__label__pos	I work from home and this has been wonderful for entertaining her while I'm working.
__label__neg	 Instead you get a airy spray of water
__label__neu	Might be user error but I didnt care for it
__label__neu	My baby is not old enough to do this on his own.
__label__neu	I figured I'd save some money not having to buy the Diaper Genie refills.
__label__neu	I would have given it 5- stars but in comparison the BBjorn has more cushion in the straps BUT it is more difficult to un- do the straps- maybe that is because you need to break them in- not sure didnt buy it.
__label__pos	I ended up having to use it sooner than I thought, and was so glad I had it on hand.A few times I was not able to produce enough milk so had to supplement with a few formula feedings.
__label__pos	"""It even has a handy clip on top of the head to attach it to your carrier, bouncy seat or diaper bag."""
__label__neg	The part that attaches to the motor/handle and the piece that allows milk through are impossible to clean
__label__pos	This is one of those items I could not live without.
__label__neg	I went to Babies R Us and returned the VentAires that my husband thankfully did not sterilize and bought the Evenflo Comfis.
__label__neu	I expected the cherry finish to be a little darker, but it is darker than the photo. 
__label__neu	They protect your baby from getting gas while he eats.
__label__neg	"""A timer would have been nice (and cheap enough to add)."""
__label__neg	This one is WAY better for the extra $10. 
__label__pos	"""i will buy this one again when i have another baby."""
__label__pos	It also has a backlight on the screen so you can use it in the dark, which is nice if the child/baby is sleeping and you dont want to turn the light on and wake him/her up to take their temp.And I LOVE the way to folds up inside itself so you dont worry about loosing the cap or cover, which I always do.This is a quality thermometer and especially for the price!!
__label__pos	It was pretty easy to put together-just follow the directions.
__label__pos	"""We are pleased overall with this set and recommend it!!"""
__label__neu	We use the kind without Zinc Oxide.
__label__neg	 If I had it to do over again, I would purchase a tub with a built in seat
__label__pos	She likes pulling apart the panels of the box.
__label__pos	The walker although is not as colorful as it seems from the picture but is good enuff to keep my son engaged.
__label__pos	"""Especially great for those nighttime leaks when you just need to change baby and the sheet and get back to bed!"""
__label__neg	 It's so small
__label__pos	She stayed snug in this blanket whenever she slept.
__label__neu	The night vision looks like the static you would see on an old TV that has lost most of its signal.
__label__neu	I started using playtex nursers during the hurricane because we had no power to run the dishwasher to wash those awful things and found that the nipple is soft,  smaller,   more like the breast,  they don't leak like Avents if you use a playtex drop in,  easy to clean and most important,  her gas problem was greatly reduced.
__label__neg	The finsh scratches really easily the drawer gliders are coming apart this is just very cheaply made.
__label__neu	We currently live in housing on base in Germany and the stairs are very wide and unusual. 
__label__pos	"""There is plenty of room in it to fit all my little one's stuff (and I like to overpack)."""
__label__neu	"""Ok, I had sticker shock."""
__label__pos	So far it has kept the food in the best, even if some does fall out.
__label__neu	 I thought I had been to hard on the first one, so I was nicer to my second one. 
__label__neg	 It's a hassle to secure in place, and most times it is pretty flimsy if you can't get it's spring locks to lock into place. 
__label__neu	In the beginning I put the tub on my bathroom counter but when they started splashing water all over the place I put this tub in our regular bath.
__label__neu	(The bee-not shown here, obviously-has little antennae that are sort of in his line of view) 
__label__neg	I tried cleaning the mirror with water and a soft cloth, thinking that it was just some adhesive from the plastic, but it made it worse. 
__label__pos	 I've tried gerber cups and those were a lot better
__label__neg	I bought this pump before leaving the hospital and it was a waste of money. 
__label__pos	Oh Boy! 
__label__neu	Why would one even need this product?
__label__pos	This is the best thing ever.
__label__neg	She really hated it and I felt that it caused more tention than it is worth.
__label__neg	And while velcro seems like a good idea,  once she gets it loose,  it could scratch her
__label__pos	"""This thing holds so much more than the little bags and sterilizes in the same amount of time!"""
__label__neg	 We found that this particular colour that we bought Tango, you had to place the child in the seat, tilt the car seat forward, all the while making sure to hold the child in the seat so that he does not fall out, tighten the belt from the back of the car seat before the belt is tight enough to be used
__label__pos	 Wow!! 
__label__neu	I can fit in a few more of her favorite soft rattles and pack the box in her diaper bag for trips out.
__label__neg	 Kinda defeats the purpose of a car seat if you ask me. 
__label__neg	I love Medela's pumps (I own the Pump in Style Advanced,  a seperate manual pump,  and used the Lactina hospital pump for 3 months),  I like their storage bottles,  I even like their nipple cream,  but these bags need some more work put into them
__label__neg	 My husband, an MD and engineer says it is obviously incapable of maintaining a reliable seal
__label__pos	While other pacifiers seemed to allow air to be sucked in, the soothie makes a tight seal.
__label__neu	Quick wipe and done!
__label__pos	I am just about to get a second set because we have a new crawler and I want to put them on the bathroom cabinets.
__label__neu	If you are skinny,  I'm sure this is a great product
__label__neg	Please note that this actually isn't manufactured by Fisher Price; the name is licensed
__label__pos	"""I also haven't had a single wipe turn brown, and the wipes have never dried out on me either even when I wasn't home to use them for over a week!"""
__label__pos	We were going to buy an electric breast pump once out of the hospital but once I started using the Isis I wanted to spend the money on other things that I needed.
__label__neg	She wasn't a very big or a very small baby,  but she kept falling over to one side in the seat
__label__pos	We love it- buy it instead, better quality and cheaper!
__label__pos	please think about using another bottle, I suggest dr browns , i threw away all my ventaire once i purchased the dr browns bottles &#62; they are definitely the best on the market.
__label__neg	I found that to be a joke since I got this as a gift for my shower (no receipt) and the repair would take six weeks (how I'll never know why).
__label__neg	), have the safety strap slits and fit the changing pad perfectly
__label__neg	In the first couple of weeks when he was 6-7 pounds, it wouldn't velcro small enough to be snug.
__label__neg	We ended up buying one of those and sadly the Sweet Peace is sitting in our basement in hopes that any future babies may enjoy it.
__label__pos	I had a premie and it fits her fine.
__label__neg	I do NOT recommend this toy,  unless you get it given
__label__neg	It did not hug her head like it is shown in the picture.
__label__pos	"""I think I've tried all (at least most) breast milk bags, and these are worth the extra money -- my favorites."""
__label__neg	My daughter is now 11 months old and the entire room STINKS whenever we have to dispose of a soiled diaper!
__label__neu	It did not take her long to figure out that kicking the bar would make the star play a song for her.
__label__neu	Ouch!  
__label__neg	I just got mine and they don't work as advertised
__label__pos	This is a wonderful toy that is fun, educational, and affordable!
__label__neg	My child at one point was afraid of this animal.
__label__neu	They have the nipple compartment on the bottom for better cleaning and have slots that the bottle nipples fit into. 
__label__neg	 Problem is the mirror is flimsy and really not of good quality
__label__pos	He feels like a big boy using a cup and straw instead of a sippy cup like his baby brother.
__label__neu	My son was two weeks early (38 weeks) and as I wasn't informed, allowed him to use this in the hospital
__label__neu	My daughter likes it ok, but it is definitely not her favorite chew toy- she likes her Sophie Giraffe much more.
__label__pos	I love this pack n' play.
__label__neg	 Newborns truly are drawn to high contrast patterns--but this product is so poorly made I would not recommend it
__label__neu	There are no weird bags and twisting - and it was smelly
__label__pos	Though the Moby takes a bit of trial and error to get the wrapping down pat, it has a pannel you can pull over the baby which secures everything in place.
__label__neg	This seems to be happening with much of this baby-proofing stuff we've ordered online.
__label__neu	Once he started rolling over we had to stop using it but we're keeping it safe for the next little one!
__label__neg	"""The product may be a fine one, but I found an &quot;extra&quot; one to be unnecessary."""
__label__neu	Does not seem like a big deal to you? 
__label__neu	My daughter likes this set but the blocks with the firmer sides that stack more easily are still our favorites.
__label__neu	i returned this item right away.
__label__neg	"""There was NO bouncing with this chair, so he just kind of sat there..."""
__label__neu	Not only were the clamps too flimsy and small to fit over the sides of my daughters car seat,  but one of the toys broke after one pull.
__label__neu	His favorite thing to do with this toy is to spin the little barrel that is on the top surface of the train behind the smokestack.  
__label__pos	They were still plenty large enough to get the job done and are no means as small as a washcloth, etc.To me, if you love instant softness and a looser weave, get these.
__label__pos	i wouldn't dream of using anything else.
__label__pos	I love that you can attach this to a crib, or when your baby gets older they can simply snuggle it.
__label__neu	I saw a lot of complaints about the color. 
__label__neu	 That shouldn't break it. 
__label__pos	It keeps all my baby food jars nice and organized.
__label__pos	"""Remember, price doesn't always equal quality..."""
__label__pos	She giggles like mad!  
__label__neg	I'll probably trash it and get a better one, I don't want to risk ruining my bed if my 3 year old misses the pad.
__label__neu	 My newborn did not like being swaddle, he liked his hands to be free
__label__neu	"""Well.."""
__label__pos	I highly recommend
__label__neu	She would always get to much air and spit up half of what she ate. 
__label__pos	love the design, great quality, full of different textures for baby, can be machine washed, fun little doudou )
__label__pos	If you get the chair, spring for the cushion. You won't regret it.
__label__neu	Patty Panda!
__label__neu	It fills up somewhat quickly, but you can make it last longer by wrapping diapers tightly before placing in the champ.
__label__neu	I place it on my son's night stand,  which is pretty tall,  and it barely reaches the ceiling.
__label__neg	They have leaked on me b/f but only occasionally when they are wet.
__label__pos	"""He loves both sides of it and will talk it."""
__label__pos	Perfect if you don't have to collapse the stroller
__label__neu	I like the Pamper's pop-up wipes but find it difficult to pull one out because they are inner-folded and stick together.
__label__neu	hey two is fine
__label__neu	"""I bought this when my daughter was a couple weeks old."""
__label__neu	I used the adhesive tape only. 
__label__neg	We thought this bathtub would be great for our newborn son, but he was never comfortable in it : the sling gets very cold when wet, and the baby's back keeps bumping into the plastic part underneath
__label__neu	I got this product as a combo with the Avent Sterilizer.
__label__neu	She didnt cry more,  she screamed more when I tried to swaddle.
__label__pos	InexpensiveEasy to inflateEasy to installWorks with a shower diverter knob on the end of the spoutCuteCons
__label__neu	"""She would only play for about 5-10 minutes at a time she would mostly look at everything and hit things by accident."""
__label__neu	Although this toy doesn't hold my son's attention as much as Freddie the Firefly does he still smiles and coos and giggles whenever he sees it.
__label__pos	I love that special pricey bags or refills are not needed with this diaper pail.
__label__neu	But as previously mentioned,  the best advice is to buy one of each and find what works for your little one
__label__neg	It hurts his legs when using the deflector part and you have to use that part with a boy. 
__label__pos	I can actually wear jewelry again!
__label__neg	 A complete waste
__label__pos	My son is 3 months old and we have had a great experience with it
__label__pos	This was a great buy, and I don't know what I would have done without it.  
__label__pos	It is easy to change the bag uses any trash bag and does a decent job of containing odor.
__label__neu	Why would I want to even have a drill near my cabinet doors?
__label__neu	I called fisher-price about the problem and they sent me a new motor. 
__label__neg	the plastic around where the power cord plugs in was completely melted!
__label__neg	Plus, I find that in the dishwasher little bits of food and guck get stuck in them, especially the nipples.
__label__neg	 Doesn't make sense, even as a way to cut costs
__label__neg	"""was worried about the price at first, but then reminded myself that you cannot put a price on your child's safety."""
__label__pos	This is one of the items that we have purchased that I am completely satisfied with.
__label__neu	I tried almost every other bottle and nipple on the market except for the Adiri Breastbottle Nurser - Baby Bottle. 
__label__pos	He really enjoys it now.
__label__pos	Trust me... if you plan on using this to feed your baby, you'll be MUCH happier with this slipcover!!
__label__neu	Go figure.
__label__neu	I really wanted to like and keep this tub, and at first, I did!
__label__pos	The lights are a little bright--but the monitor works well with our two story house.
__label__pos	Excellent!
__label__pos	My MIL bought it for a visit and ours (Graco) is much, much better. 
__label__neg	When my daughter is done with this chair, I think I'll sell it in a garage sale and get a Graco for the next kid.
__label__pos	I've heard the Munchkin one play in person and it sounds like it is dying and about to run out of batteries.
__label__neg	 I have stopped using it and am looking for another diaper pail system
__label__neu	The guard is hard plastic & cuts into his legs leaving deep red marks.
__label__pos	"""This seat is so multi-functional."""
__label__pos	"""This is a good product so keep yourself from losing it and buy and obnoxious color you can see anywhere."""
__label__neg	"""Personally I think bottle warmers are a waste of money."""
__label__pos	"""I bought them today and they work great on my son's highchair tray."""
__label__pos	He does get very warm in it, so I only use it for short periods of time when it is hot.
__label__neu	It's only a matter of time before he gets to the stereo, TV and DVD player, hence we bought this Parent Units DVD/CD guard.
__label__pos	We use this mat everyday outside and it still looks great.
__label__pos	"""Everytime I am out in public and my daughter is in her stroller happily sucking away on the Podee, people are amazed by this device, most have never seen it before, and everyone wants to know where to get it!"""
__label__neg	 Sell yours on ebay, spend ten bucks for a good audio monitor, and put the rest in baby's college fund where you'll get much more use out of it
__label__pos	Luckily,  we we're over some really cushy carpet.
__label__pos	she has loved it since day one!
__label__neu	If possible,  buy in person
__label__pos	Very soft and plush
__label__neg	 I had to set it in a corner and tie the straps to the crib with fishing line. 
__label__neg	Unfortunately, not one but TWO of the pieces that snap together to keep the whole unit in one piece had broken. 
__label__neg	 Then one of my bags tipped over in the freezer and it leaked, causing a frozen puddle of breast milk in my brand new freezer to clean. 
__label__neg	When I tried to clean it (first water,  then window spray,  then some windshield wax)  it went from hazy,  to more hazy,  to scratched,  to beyond scratched,  to wiping some of the mirror away
__label__neu	One cabinet worked well but my toddler pulled on it hard enough to break the adhesive. 
__label__pos	This is a fun product!
__label__neg	Mine didn't work from day 1! 
__label__neg	I have to take it from her between sips and squeeze the straw to get air back in the cup so she can sip again.
__label__neg	What a waste of money it was.- It was very annoying to put together and it doesn't fit through doorways, so it needs to be assembled and disassembled in the room where it is used- It was cheap materials - the
__label__pos	"""It is waiting for baby to arrive so it's not tested but so far I'm pleased with it as a cover for the mattress."""
__label__neg	I wanted to just set it up on the coffee table for instance when in the living room but that doesn't work because its not flat on the bottom.
__label__pos	Totally more fun!
__label__pos	"""No bad plastic smell."""
__label__neg	 Save the $ and get an audio
__label__neg	Yes, I do realize it's not a walker but to take from one room to the next, wheels would be great.
__label__pos	 I liked that he could face forward but
__label__neu	Strangely enough, so does my 4 yr old, who I had to locate and retrieve the toys from several times the first day.
__label__neu	We used it when she was just born to sit her in while we were eating.  
__label__pos	I have never had a leak-through and have been very pleased with the success of these pads.
__label__pos	But it is convenient and compact and it does do it's job even on the wideneck bottles.
__label__neu	Putting it together is a chore,  very difficult.
__label__neg	However I have problems with the cutting mechanism almost every time I empty it,  it will only partially cut through the plastic (and that was on the stage 1
__label__pos	This product has made bath time a completely fun experience with NO TEARS!
__label__neu	My daughter is a vigorous nurser and we supplement with expressed breast milk while I am at work.
__label__pos	I have the Graco Cubby Parade Pack N Play and figured the sheets would be good since they're manufactured by the same company. 
__label__neu	It defenitely works for my lil munchkin!
__label__neu	I compared his old with his new and they changed them, WHY?!?!?!?!
__label__neu	You have to place the shade high on the window in the straight area.
__label__neg	For these formulas, this pitcher is useless.
__label__neg	Also, we bought this for a new born and it was rather uncomfortable in the beginning because he would slide all over the place
__label__neg	 Also, it didn't have a mirror or the little book that the laugh 'n learn barnyard animal one did
__label__neg	"""(That's why I took off a star)."""
__label__neg	 Took it back the very same day
__label__pos	perfect
__label__pos	Try the Playtex Premium Nurser. 
__label__neu	Yeah the Boppy's not as firm as it was in the beginning but I wouldn't describe it as lumpy or saggy - it has the same shape and support it's just a little smushed but babies get bigger with time and those big hineys take a toll on the Boppy's stuffing!
__label__pos	Now he can nest and stack them on his own.
__label__neu	We didn't know this,  so we usually had it unplugged during the day (not always in use) and then plugged it in each night to recharge (besides,  if you didn't plug it in at night,  would you really want to be awakened by the beeping of the dying battery?
__label__neg	 Nipple confusion is very real and disruptive to breastfeeding moms who encounter it
__label__pos	It's a basic toy, but a good one.
__label__pos	Convenient with several uses
__label__pos	I use them with warm water  (or camomile and jojoba oil which I make and put in a little spray bottle) and wipe his face, hands and toes and then throw them in the wash and so far they are holding out nicely with the every day use.
__label__neu	I was too busy trying to get on with just taking care of her to even use it for more than a week
__label__neu	Link Along Friends
__label__pos	We live on a tropical island that gets loads of sun and the Kiddopatamus sun shade is perfect for keeping my little man out of the sun. 
__label__neu	I have tinted window and the sun always seems to find my baby's face.
__label__pos	This dog is the first toy to make my son giggle.  
__label__neg	 Quite frankly, I think it drys out the wipes, and only warms the first two on top
__label__pos	Worth the Extra Money
__label__neg	The twist tie closure system is cumbersome.
__label__neg	 they cannot properly dry after use and this nasty stuff collects and there isn't any real good way of cleaning it out
__label__neu	It is a great idea,  but unfortunately it is of terrible quality.
__label__neg	 We threw ours in the garbage, no luck here on these
__label__pos	is also nice - I attach a link on it for when it is just not right
__label__neu	Ha!
__label__pos	The Potty Stool is a wonderful stool.
__label__neu	Baby is breast-fed and I registered for these so I could pump and my husband could feed her at night.
__label__neu	I use a hairband to keep up the top part
__label__neu	"I got an ""F"" for having this product in the car seat."
__label__pos	"""Definitely a wonderful investment."""
__label__neg	We got one of these when our son was a newborn in part to avoid interference with some 2
__label__neu	I have both the Halo fleece sleep sack and this cotton one. 
__label__neg	 I really would not register for this product again
__label__neu	After my Medela Harmony suddonly quit working, I was in a rush for a new pump and ended up getting the Avent Isis.
__label__pos	It dries quickly and easily (I just hang it in the shower).
__label__pos	Greast monitor with no interference!
__label__neg	The water doesn't come out in too good of a stream and the container takes up too much room in the tub.
__label__neg	 It works the same and is more attractive
__label__neg	Returning to work and continuing to nurse your baby is hard enough without the hassle of these bags.
__label__pos	Do yourself a favor and acquire this helpful product!
__label__neu	I just purchased this gate for my son to keep him away from my basement steps.
__label__pos	If I could,  I'd probably raise this to 3,  maybe even 4,  stars
__label__pos	 Made it alot easier to wash his hair too since he was leaning back
__label__neg	In addition, the way the bags are placed in the box they don't pop up as you pull one out, so I'm always struggling to get another bag out as I'm handling a dirty diaper
__label__neg	I was never fond of this even with the first use
__label__pos	"""The other great part is that it's a one size fits all so you and your partner can use it without having to buy two that are different sizes or worry that you bought the wrong size."""
__label__neu	We got this before we remodeled our bathroom and it wouldn't stick to the tile.
__label__pos	Much less hassle and same results.
__label__neg	 My kids actually ingested more air b/c of the nipple shape - they just couldn't get their mouths around the large base
__label__pos	"""I like that with these colors I can use it in another room once we don't have a nursery anymore."""
__label__pos	and the Isis is very comfortable to use.
__label__neu	However my son was jumping so much in his saucer that I figured I'd give it a go.
__label__neu	Thank goodness is is the side facing the wall
__label__neg	 I measured and it only has one ounce per cube
__label__neg	 It takes forever for the formula to get warm by this product
__label__pos	"""The Jumperoo is suspended, so she is able to kick off with her legs and get it going."""
__label__neu	An added note - Don't put them in the drier.
__label__pos	)OverviewOverall I am happy with my purchase.
__label__neg	They just don't stay on
__label__pos	and you are pretty sure they are clean!
__label__neg	Not even worth going to the PO for half the price minus shipping. 
__label__neu	First of all,  the music plays only when the chair is moved...it hardly plays when my son goes potty on it.
__label__pos	The little balls for rattling are kinda fun, too.
__label__neu	He used the curved bottom part to prop himself while watching Thomas.  
__label__pos	This is OK for the short time that I am actually going to use it because it does get the job done.
__label__neg	Others mentioned leaking around the bottom of the bottle; I had a bottle leak one time but soon realized I did not have the plastic disc in place completely.
__label__pos	I like the clear because it goes with everything.
__label__neu	Also,  it just doesn't seem to hold water.
__label__neg	Our little one is over 20 lbs now and I still use this more than our jogger when hiking.
__label__pos	This set is the most complete one on the market and there will be no need to supplement it with anything else.
__label__pos	My 3 month old loves the bounce of this chair as she kicks and bats at the swinging animals when she is in it she squeals with delight.
__label__pos	You can also push the button to go back and forth between regular and letdown mode. 
__label__neg	A friend recommended a wipe warmer after he got one for his 4th child.
__label__neg	Trying to mix formula in the bottle also didn't work well
__label__pos	Bulky but a great tub.
__label__neu	form fitting&quot
__label__neg	While it is easy to use, it seems geared toward bigger kids. 
__label__neu	I tried everything to stop the leaks,  but nothing worked.
__label__pos	This product has not only made bottle cleaning easy but it also allows for a convenient place to store them.
__label__neu	I had to pump while my daughter was in the hospital the first month of her life.
__label__neu	[...]
__label__pos	This toy is very great!
__label__pos	"""Our daughter loves in it."""
__label__neg	There are no lights or upbeat songs.
__label__pos	I recommend these for piece of mind
__label__pos	"""When my baby started eating solid foods (about 5 months ago) we got this, thinking it would tide us over until we chose a full-size high chair."""
__label__pos	But again,  the kids did love it,  and now we've had it for about 2 years.
__label__neu	"Also,  this one randomly does a series of three to six loud beeps when it's on,  scaring our dog and guests (""What in the world is THAT noise?"
__label__pos	You can use it to hold newborns upright or laying down and even nurse comfortably.
__label__pos	Saves babies clothing from stains and wetness.
__label__neu	"""Yes, it may be the best there is out there, but that doesn't mean too much."""
__label__pos	Using regular garbage bags is a huge money saver and there is plenty of room for tons of diapers
__label__neu	The fact that they are recyclable is a bonus, but these bottles are incredibly pricey ($1/bottle) to be used daily at every feeding.
__label__neg	The only thing I have a problem with is the little noise it makes whenever I pump and it feels not private.
__label__neu	I sent it back,  confirmed by FedEx,  and they haven't credited one penny.
__label__neu	"I usually put them over my fist and try to shape them ""rounder"" before I put them in my bra."
__label__neg	 It didn't play music and light would not turn off
__label__neu	I bought this for my son when he was 3 months old.
__label__neu	All the other nipples i tried with other bottles weren't marked so i had no idea which ones were slow flow and fast flow after i had sterilized them all.
__label__pos	It may not work for everyone, but for the first few months, it was a lifesaver for us, AND NO TEARS!!
__label__pos	When I'm walking in the morning or in the evening when the sun is at an angle I simply pull the sun shade down and readjust it - the velcro straps are pretty long so you can make it fit no matter how you have to tweek it. 
__label__pos	I love this stroller sun shade! 
__label__pos	"""We are still using it because it is so easy to use, easy to clean and we see no reason to buy another high chair that will just take up space."""
__label__neu	(In fact I've bought quite a few for friends having babies.)
__label__neg	We found this to be useless
__label__neu	I like the Lansinoh pads much better as they are thin and large which means they can be folded over when you open the bra flap to nurse. 
__label__neu	The seat doesn't play any music - which our baby really would have loved. 
__label__pos	"""1st of all very portable, easy to use, and great low price."""
__label__neg	 It was a waste of money for our cabinets
__label__neu	I choose to get a refund as the replacement would have been the same swing and after reading some of these review it might not have been defective after all.
__label__neg	There's no room to move or stretch or anything!
__label__neg	He HATES LOATHES DESPISES this
__label__neu	The batteries seemed to last for a while, and you can set the volume and the length of play.
__label__pos	My son didn't seem to mind!
__label__neu	Right back in the box and I drove back to the store the same day
__label__neu	"""Battery life is decent, but wish they had a AC plug in model."""
__label__pos	Our child sleeps like a baby..
__label__neg	My son hates this
__label__neu	I found the latch extremely hard to fully tighten because of a lip in the plastic base,  which overlaps where my hand needed to be to tighten the latch straps.
__label__pos	I really liked the diaper genie at first
__label__neg	They work pretty well, but after awhile my little guy figured out how to just push it down so that it opens up.
__label__pos	If you're trying to decide between this and the bouncer GET THIS.
__label__neu	"""If you read the insert that comes in the package, you would discover that for yourself."""
__label__pos	"""1. the fabric is SO much softer"""
__label__pos	"""It's great for quick trips and everyday use."""
__label__pos	The incline is perfect
__label__neg	 Not worth it
__label__neu	I am not terribly impressed - I wish it was tighter and also wish it was one solid bumper.
__label__neg	It's hard to hold her steady in the tub because it is too slippery. 
__label__neg	The quality of this product was completely fine but my problem is with the color choices.
__label__neg	buy something different.
__label__neu	Wow!
__label__neg	 Overall, we've found that while they have a great marketing campaign, Baby Einstein makes pretty poorly designed baby toys
__label__neu	For a newborn/infant - I felt that the head support was only so-so. 
__label__neg	I figured a manual pump would be a little easier to use than hooking up the electric pump.
__label__neg	I just didn't care for this at all.  
__label__pos	"""They work wonderfully!"""
__label__neu	"""The beads that form the rainbow portion of the ring are sort of strung on the ring instead of glued solid."""
__label__neg	Horrible product
__label__neu	If you are looking to make a mess,  lose milk and get frustrated,  these are the bags for you.
__label__pos	"""Great product!"""
__label__pos	Fits nicely on stroller w/ velcro straps.
__label__pos	There is so much to see and do with this toy, and I love that the creators of it didn't feel the need to design it with all kinds of flashing lights, silly songs, and other bells and whistles.
__label__pos	(I'm really big on toys that don't do stuff but encourage kids to use their creativity.
__label__neg	"""So she gave the gate two or three really good yanks, and the bottom came loose, followed by the top, and the whole thing needed to be put back up."""
__label__pos	It fits our tub well and the kid loves it.
__label__pos	there is no need for a pricey bathtub, this one works fantastic!
__label__pos	"""My 7 year old niece couldn't figure out how to open this gate, much less the baby."""
__label__pos	This is a nice paci for babies who are outgrowing the regular soothie pacifier.
__label__neu	Boy was I wrong. 
__label__neg	All the different noices and rattles,  I guess,  are supposed to be educational,  I don't see much value in it from educational standpoint
__label__pos	"""These bibs are nice, they do their job but smill like tires."""
__label__neg	Of course,  it's basically just one long strip of stretchy fabric
__label__pos	"""this changing cover has worked well with our changing pad helded up in the wash from so many poopie diapers..."""
__label__neg	(as in, if you're traveling)  it's very big and bulky when folded and doesn't stay folded. 
__label__neg	 At this price this is WAY too expensive
__label__pos	"""They leaked and it was impossible to screw the lids on correctly."""
__label__neg	Then he submitted and eventually fell asleep.
__label__pos	5 month-old's legs ended up either banging the shower contraption or simply hanging out of the tub!
__label__neu	My son has never had any problems with colic, excessive spit up or gas. 
__label__pos	We've not had any issues with flushing them either (we have a septic system and an older toilet) and they work fine for what we need.
__label__neg	I feel bad that some people have had such a poor experience with this lock.
__label__pos	"""and she started rolling over - i think it had to do with all the kicking and arm swinging from playing in the gym it just really helped develop her muscles."""
__label__neu	Spring tension seems about as heavy as it could be to dissuade small fingers without making it too hard for an adult to operate.
__label__neu	 However, we switched to Dr
__label__neu	The clear side of the rattle has a spinner in it with three different sides:  a bullseye, a ladybug, and a mirror.
__label__neu	It does not always do so on either of our toilets,  but we have the padded toilet seat and lids
__label__neu	 Little did we know that it is really hard to find anything in this bag because of all the little tiny zipper compartments and the main compartment only zips down the side so you have to take everything out of the bag to actually see what you are looking for. 
__label__pos	This is an awesome item!
__label__neg	I bought these bottles for my newborn and initially found the vent system to be working but after 2 weeks all the vent systems on the 6 bottles we had stopped working simultaneously and the nipples were collapsing
__label__pos	Great seat, with one minor flaw.
__label__neu	"""So I sucked it up and threw down the money for the more expensive Baby Bjorn."""
__label__neu	She is now to big for the sling,  but to small to sit up in the ring.
__label__neg	So now the pump just sits in it's little travel bag collecting dust,  what a waist of $50
__label__neg	Mine broke the first week I had it
__label__neu	I want to take these boards and screws and plummet them at the person who decided it would be a good idea to have a consumer assemble this in such a manner.
__label__neg	I don't use it in their car seats because the smaller part of the head rest only fit their heads for a few weeks and the bigger part is to big for them now.
__label__neg	This product is not recommended unless you don't mind it breaking every 12 months.I've owned two now that start off working pretty well.
__label__neu	e
__label__neg	 After it dried (which it did without any problems btw) it still smelled
__label__neu	Serves purpose but without class
__label__neg	Still didn't do the trick.
__label__neu	My 6 month old will put this in his mouth while he sits at the table with us and it generally gets covered with food or drool.
__label__pos	He just lies on the soft terry cloth.
__label__neu	She sat there for a moment, kicked the bar, activing the musical star.
__label__neg	 It is closed off at one end with only tiny holes and the other end is folded into the lid
__label__pos	So far we have noticed NO odors.
__label__pos	Neither of my daughters liked to swing, but they both loved the bouncing motion.  
__label__pos	"""Avoid nipple confusion and use avent!"""
__label__neu	She likes to be high up and see everything that's going on around her.
__label__neg	We have many as our daughter loves music and ocean sounds,  but this one is horrible,  i would not recommend this to anyone
__label__neu	"""We bought this for about 70 bucks and got 4 sage lined wicker baskets to fit within it for organization."""
__label__neg	"""And there was NO WAY I could put him on my back alone - I needed the help from my husband to put him on my back - and unfortunately, I am alone with my son most of the time so I could never put him on alone."""
__label__pos	This mat was a no brainer for me after getting theFisher- Price Rainforest Open- Top Cradle Swingand seeing how wonderful the colors and brightness of the product are.
__label__neg	I think this is defintely one of those products that you can do without.
__label__neu	the only drawback is that although every square inch is crammed with toys for my little ones the exersaucer came fully disassembled and my poor husband spent almost 3 hours putting the two together.
__label__pos	But my 5 1/2 month old seems to like it.
__label__neu	My baby kept slipping down and her ears would get under water.
__label__neg	 They are suppose to have a reservoir to catch the milk, but your nipple must protrude a certain distance in order for the shell to work. 
__label__pos	Works Well For My Preemie
__label__neu	and I use the Dex Wipe Warmer with changing light in the area of the wipe holder.  
__label__neu	"The wall was too ""freeform"" to use regular 90-degree and straight-edge padding, so we figured by snaking this yard around the fireplace and entertainment center we'd pretty well babyproof the whole living room. "
__label__neu	After bringing my Medela electric pump back and forth between home and the office for a few weeks I decided to purchase a manual pump to keep at home.  
__label__pos	"I read someone elses review that says ""couldn't have taken a shower without it"", all I have to say to that is, hallelujah!"
__label__neu	She CAN get it to overlap her chin a little bit with some squirming which may cause her to try and suck on it (rarely happens) but there is no bunching or constriction.
__label__neg	WOW, what a waste of money!
__label__neu	my dogs try to sneak onto it when the baby isn't in it
__label__neu	So, I splurged and bought this carrier.
__label__neu	When I think of my children touching those surfaces and then putting their little hands in their mouths, or rubbing their eyes... 
__label__neu	It is way too bulky to add to a car seat.
__label__neg	12) He would slide all over even when held and even would slide down with his back ending up on the butt gap
__label__neg	My baby was only 2 months and I already had to move the water tub out of the bigger tub to make room for baby, and my baby's legs were still cramped.
__label__pos	It's unique to look at and very functional. 
__label__neg	sad but true,  it did not match my other davinci stuff that was also cherry
__label__neu	While not as soft they are more utilitarian and get the job done.
__label__neg	don't buy a lot of any one bottle until you are sure that your baby is going to latch on well
__label__pos	Perfect bottle
__label__pos	I now only use it twice in the evening after my baby is in bed.
__label__neu	Get a foamy bath tub thing
__label__pos	We have a bunch of teether toys but this is by far his favorite. 
__label__neu	We bought this for our three month old
__label__neu	I don't know why it didn't work for me,  but it didn't.
__label__neu	I took it back and bought a basic tub and a foam bear pad to lay her on.
__label__neu	This pad is HUGE, much bigger than I was expecting - it will easily cover an entire crib mattress.  
__label__pos	All in all I loved this product and so did both of our boys!
__label__neg	 The seat was not made correctly and I could not get it to fit on the frame. 
__label__neg	I'd recommend that one instead
__label__neu	Most of the P.
__label__neg	The only issue I had with the swing is the switch on the right side of the motor that controls the butterfly light between the battery and a/c plug setting. 
__label__pos	Now I lift the whole lid and toss the diaper in this allows me to keep tabs on how full it's getting and squeeze in a few extra that the mechanism wouldn't have allowed and still trap the smell!
__label__pos	"""To my amazement, I fell in love with it all over again!"""
__label__pos	We've had this for so many years and it's saved us many times.
__label__pos	 Based on the ratings in Consumer Reports and the reviews on this website, I eagerly purchased two of these to keep the kids in our living room
__label__pos	"""We'll the research paid off, we've been using it for 8 months now and no problems what so ever."""
__label__neg	Not a favorite.
__label__pos	It is so warm and easy to use. 
__label__neg	I'm going to return the rest for a store credit and try to find a suitable replacement elsewhere. 
__label__neg	"The fact that ""leak-proof"" is in the title is really ironic."
__label__neg	 I found this product had terrible static
__label__pos	She's been sleeping sweetly now for over an hour and went to sleep the instant she was placed in this device.
__label__neg	 same amount of support/lack of water/one handedness
__label__neg	I use Playtex DropIns bottles/nipples, which are larger than average nipples
__label__neg	"""I don't know if this holds true if you use the suctions cups on a hard wood floor, as I only ever used it on carpet and grass"""
__label__neg	 Maybe I am too petite for this item but it was not very plyable at all and became far too cumbersome. 
__label__pos	Changing bags is easy too.
__label__neg	First of all we had to use a pipe wrench to get the thing unscrewed it was so tight neither dh or I could get it to budge and even w/ the pipe wrench it was a challenge Then there was no way I could get the arrow to line up w/ the square unless I used the pipe wrench hmmm not sure I want to carry a pipe wrench around with me when I need to pump  Oh and the suction is horrible.
__label__pos	I like the plastic they use.
__label__neg	My husband put a dent into this thing with his _nail_ -- exactly what is it made out of?
__label__pos	There is plenty of room for that.
__label__neg	But all you need to do is buy the wipes that are folded that way.
__label__pos	"""She is still in her Boulevard, but she is too tall for the cheap seat now."""
__label__pos	I was so excited to try these out since they really do seem like the perfect thing for typically breastfed babies. 
__label__neg	Yuck.
__label__neu	He whirls the rollers spins the globe and pounds the music knob.
__label__pos	They are adorable, soft and a good size for my 4 month old.  
__label__neg	Not a good mat at all.
__label__neu	In addition,  pieces were missing and some of the screws would not fit in their intended place!
__label__pos	She's been using it for about a month so far, and hasn't grown tired of it yet.
__label__neu	My son now sits up on his own but I feel he can slip too easily in this tub.
__label__neg	 She jsut looked at it, expected it to do something when she kicked nothing happened, so boredom set ini. 
__label__pos	It's fun for him to learn to sit up and it offers a new vantage point for him.
__label__neg	 We purchased the first swing in December 06
__label__pos	This one is even better b/c of the rail that goes around the actual changing area.
__label__pos	"""I only wish we had bought this sooner."""
__label__pos	My husband and I both love this carrier.
__label__neg	Don't waste your money because you can't return this item
__label__neu	This is a great pail except for the heavy lid.
__label__neu	I had a friend recommend it to me and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.
__label__neg	 Wish we bought that one from the start
__label__pos	My only regret is that I didn't get it sooner than I did.
__label__pos	This is a great seat for the money.
__label__neu	"""Too many times to count."""
__label__pos	It's easy to hold, and the entire thing has good textures for chewing.
__label__neu	To open it, all you do is step on the foot pedal, which is needs weight to open.  
__label__neu	We started with another mobile--the Tiny Love Musical Symphony.
__label__neu	I have just had to stop using them due to the lack of speed.
__label__neg	 We have been waiting for her to play with it for two months
__label__neu	I ordered these bottles to replace my Dr. Brown's bottles when my daughter was about 5 months because they were BPA free.
__label__neg	Hence the 1 star deduction.  
__label__pos	He has fun kicking and pushing off of the front of the tub.
__label__pos	 We're sticking with Sophie.
__label__neu	, 2004, 1091664000B00005BXKMA12JF1M45OIDD2, B00005BXKM, A12JF1M45OIDD2, Marcus If you are formula-feeding,  just use the microwave.
__label__neg	 Since he was supervised, nothing bad happened, but babes at this age (4 months) don't have enough control to pull back the toy from their mouths when already scared by the gagging
__label__neu	!
__label__neg	My biggest complaint about them though is how they attach to the crib.
__label__neu	Since it leaks I collect the milk and don't waste it at all!
__label__pos	I first thought these were so adorable
__label__neu	I didn't find anything decent under $16 and even that one was a gamble about fit
__label__neg	Please don't waste your money on these bottles
__label__neu	On top of that,  the terrycloth just doesn't clean well,  even with those special baby-stain removers and even with Shout!
__label__neu	That counts for a lot when you are traveling with an infant
__label__neu	"It was working awesome until one day I found the ""wings"" of the swaddle bunched up around her neck."
__label__neg	It sticks for one week and then its down
__label__pos	 The target warmer heats from the top to the bottom, which keeps the top wipes moist and warm, just as they should be. 
__label__pos	"""Itis beautiful, and if you have the money to spend, then go right ahead and get one."""
__label__neg	but when i put her in the infant side, she slides down.  
__label__pos	The musics are also very soothing.
__label__pos	Right now, I have it thumbtacked up there, which is working fine, but once she gets older and is able to reach it, I'll have to hang it more securely.
__label__neg	I had to sit there and continuously push the bottle down onto the latch AND then after 10 minutes,  the bottle was still ice cold
__label__neu	"Not sure if this says anyhting about the ""anti-colic nipples"", but whatever.Here are some of the major comments I have:LEAKING-They only leak if you don't dry them completely or put the lid on wrong."
__label__neu	But after the first month,  it became more of a hindrance.
__label__pos	"""Great gift for a shower, or for entertaining a very picky little baby!"""
__label__neu	PS I also had the same problems as below thats how I came to this idea.
__label__neu	She ride both faceing in and out.
__label__neu	So the bubbles are entirely necessary to equalize the pressure inside the bottle with the outside.
__label__neg	"""The notes are really tinny and it repeats one note for a really long time."""
__label__neu	Make sure your windows are not cold when you apply them, otherwise they won't stick.
__label__pos	When folded down on the stroller it is very flat.
__label__neg	 But she is tall and thin
__label__pos	Glad I Got This One
__label__neg	I didn't feel like it really fit me - and I am not a big woman - size 8 before pregnancy, size 10-12 while nursing. 
__label__neu	This Fisher Price corner bath cubby is a waste of money,  I'm going to try the kidco storage caddy instead.
__label__neg	I cannot stand this highchair! 
__label__neu	So for me whether the plug changes color or not is no biggie, I am always making sure the temp is fine anyway.
__label__neg	Problems: The latch cord wasn't long enough so we had to do the seatbelt install instead
__label__neu	There's no way of getting out of this one.
__label__neg	Lastly, the airplane seatbelt (we flew on American) didn't get tight enough to really keep him in place. 
__label__pos	It is really a nice product to have
__label__neg	 My opinion on this toy has totally changed
__label__pos	"""Comfortable for mom & baby."""
__label__pos	"""Immediately she started bouncing away."""
__label__neg	 Two does come in a pack, but for $16 it should be 6!
__label__neg	Secondly, I think these bottles are overpriced
__label__pos	In the age of overstimulating toys, this one earns five stars from our family for being super inexpensive, captivating, and simple.
__label__neu	Purchased this item when I had my second child so that I could monitor them visually as well as audibly.
__label__pos	Works well for drawers that are too shallow for you to get a drill/screwdriver in for attaching traditional latches.
__label__neu	 The step is at a angle, and the seat did fit or cove the toilet. 
__label__neu	On the new version I do not see the tabs to loop the plastic bag handles over I hope that doesn't mean you can't use them anymore.
__label__neu	He didn't really seem to enjoy it either.
__label__pos	"""The time now was well worth the ease in the future."""
__label__pos	"""My son is now 4 months and I still use it."""
__label__pos	I am very happy with it.
__label__pos	I returned it & ordered an Ellaroo from PeppermintDOTcom -- it is so much more comfortable & more secure the baby doesn't bounce or sag and it's beautiful.
__label__neg	My other complaint is that the cutting mechanism doesn't work properly.
__label__pos	Not just for babies since this is a great intercom system.  
__label__pos	My daughter is happy enough with this saucer
__label__neu	It's now getting a little cooler (late Fall), so we got a larger microfleece model.
__label__pos	I think that saying a spoon's best use is as a decoration says it all.
__label__neg	The flashing lights didn't work, then did, and now they don't, and we just bought this yesterday. 
__label__neg	I found it easy to use and it sticks to the bathtub great, BUT my two month old is constantly slipping down and I have to keep pulling him back up onto the hammock. 
__label__pos	 I put it on the car seat and was looking forward to bringing my baby home in it. 
__label__neg	The battery pack fell off the crib and broke the first time I tried to put it on. 
__label__neu	Our son received Mortimer for Christmas this last year.  
__label__neg	I do not recommend this product at all.
__label__pos	So far it has worked great and it is easy to use and carry with us
__label__neg	For such an expensive cover, I expected a LOT more.
__label__neu	The fit was somewhat loose on my crib and hard to adjust it to be tight.
__label__pos	I ended up using a rolled up receiving blanket and that worked much better.
__label__pos	I don't think I could ask for anything more out of a booster chair.
__label__pos	The co-sleeper is great for my daughter to sleep or rest in.
__label__neu	I went with another one after using this one for 6 months!
__label__pos	Quick comfortable compact.
__label__neg	 Really, who wants a tub that leaks
__label__neu	 I couldn't really tell the difference between the two versions at the store
__label__neu	and pumps 2 breasts at one time.
__label__neg	 I think it squeezed her
__label__pos	The 3 stages of this tub (newborn, infant and toddler) will make it a useful item for a long time.
__label__pos	She loves the swing and it's a great way to occupy her so I can do a quick load of laundry.
__label__neu	"""Gary Peterson"""
__label__pos	"The ""peekaboo flap"" crinkles and this is another favorite aspect of the toy for her."
__label__neu	He doesn't actually bounce by himself yet he's only 4 months old but he loves to kick with his feet and grab the toys.
__label__neu	Each section is a squeaky, crinkle or rattle, and the mouth squeezes to play music.
__label__neg	 But Snuggli was so difficult to use with all those straps and belts that my impatient baby had a fit every time
__label__pos	He has since trained himself to not put his feet near it (he got little bruises on his heels), and other than that he loves this seat.
__label__pos	It looks great.
__label__pos	"""But even with the meds and special formula she still had a terrible time with gas and spitting up until we found these!"""
__label__pos	I took it off the block, I used the velcro straps on the back of it (that hold it to the block), to put it in her crib and she absolutely loves having it there.
__label__pos	Good for quick trips.
__label__neg	Unless you want to hang it in the tub itself (which is then totally in the way) the don't stick
__label__neu	I've tried plugging both parts into to other outlets but have had no luck. 
__label__neg	Not worth it.
__label__pos	I would recommend this pail to anyone.
__label__pos	We get a kick out of seeing our son exploring in his crib and not even knowing he has an audience!
__label__neu	Good luck!
__label__neu	I mean really. 
__label__neg	"""This is not as big as you think."""
__label__neg	 For our purposes, this toy was over-priced for the benefit I'd hoped to get out of it
__label__neg	 That's a lot to ask of a two year old
__label__pos	After looking at several different variations my husband and I decided to go with this one.
__label__neg	Otherwise,  doesn't hold his interest much
__label__neu	Rounded:  the baby rolls toward your belly and eventually slips inbetween you and the pillow, so then what's the point of having the pillow?  
__label__neg	They are also cheaply made. 
__label__pos	Yes, it's kind of a nuisance to deal with all of the parts when cleaning, but it's quick and quiet, and when my daughter has a nap that's so long I get uncomfortable, it's so easy to grab this and squeeze out an ounce or two to make myself comfortable.
__label__neu	I was sent both this one and the microwave sterilizer.I just had a baby boy 2 weeks back so one can imagine my excitement and nervousness.I used the microwave sterilizer from avent again for 1 week and it was awesome.Extremely convenient and easy.ITs been a week now that i have received the iQ24 and I have been blown away by the features.This one too sterilizes in no time and 6 minutes in mode 1 with 90 ml of water and keeps everything sterile for 7-8 hoursMode 2 does the same with 200 ml of water keeping everything sterile for 24 hours.I love the easy operation and the fact that it holds much more than the microwave sterilizer.the only thing i didnt like is the fact that everything remains wet ..ofcourse its steam and it condenses..So far , I love it.
__label__neg	We have a 1- month- old and we've tried it several times and he hates it with a passion.
__label__pos	;-) He is a winter baby so I'm sure he appreicates our efforts to keep his tushy warm.
__label__neg	I've completely stopped using it at this point because I got tired of constantly messing with it.
__label__pos	 It is easy to use and def
__label__neu	With my first child her swaddling always came undone when she was carried or being passed around to friends and family.
__label__neg	The Diaper Genie was so hard to use and didn't do anything to stop odors.
__label__neg	After using this product for over a year as an infant has grown into a toddler, my opinion of it has gone down further.
__label__pos	LOVE this for our little girl.
__label__pos	My husband mounted this to the door frame and adjusted the gate to fit the door, no problem.  
__label__pos	"""You can attach it to the stroller too, which is great for cold weather - and especially great for those who go jogging or walking with their babies, since there won't be anymore blankets falling off all the time!"""
__label__pos	Great car seat!
__label__pos	This BB is so handy
__label__pos	He actually sleeps better since we bought it.
__label__pos	Absolutely L...o....v...e this pillow.
__label__neu	 The straps that go around the baby may appear to be tight, but the Bundle Me may actually bunched up under the straps and therefore the restraints aren't as tight as they should be. 
__label__neg	 One day I took a drink of his juice and it turns out you have to bite the straw to get liquid out
__label__neu	Pay the extra $$$ and get the Baby Bjorn, even if just the original model.
__label__neu	As I sit here typing this review, my son is just behind me bouncing away!
__label__neg	If you really need this kind of doodad,  there is another type out there where you can use your own plastic bag
__label__pos	Works great on my 7 month old as well.
__label__pos	I definetly go with the diaper champ, better odor control, no refill bags ( use conventional kitchen trash bags).
__label__pos	I have a hard to entertain baby and this toy is great.
__label__neg	by the way,  after buying this at this ridiculous price on amazon,  i saw the SAME EXACT 2 PACK at target for $1
__label__neu	We purchased this gate because of the great reviews and also because I have 2 70lbs Terriers that need to start getting used to being guarded off.  
__label__pos	This item is awesome.
__label__pos	It's easy to use (I never even read the directions) and is great for building up a supply
__label__neu	I used it in the airports, malls.
__label__neu	I tried to take it back to Babies R Us but the return time had already passed so they wouldn't take it back
__label__neg	I do not use the individual smaller containers that came with it.
__label__neu	Our daughter has never really shown much interest in any toys that are free standing meaning not hanging from her play mat or over her bouncy seat.
__label__neg	It does not contain odors very well
__label__pos	"""Some of them you had to put over the car seat and take it off everytime you had to take baby off the seat..."""
__label__pos	They are at least twice as soft and thick as other cloth diapers.
__label__neg	"My son tore a neck muscle when he was delivered and b/c of that he ""tips"" to one side,  and the toys were always hitting him in the head"
__label__neu	 And I am pretty handy with these things
__label__pos	It is an excellent choice.
__label__neu	All I can hear is static, no matter what channel I use or where I place it in my house!!
__label__neu	My daughter is a strong little girl and though she needed to be swaddled in order to actually sleep...she fought it most of the time.
__label__pos	"""I've used them as liners in baby's co-sleeper, placed them under baby's head while feeding, etc."""
__label__pos	It is a nice warmer though and I would recommend it to others just as long as their baby is patient enough to wait the minute or mintue and a half that it takes to warm up the bottle.
__label__neu	I had to put a dictionary under him so is feet would touch! 
__label__pos	THIS PRODUCT IS VERY EASY TO USE AND PERFECT FOR TRAVELING BUT THE 2 STINKY THINGS ABOUT IT IS THAT THE BASKET IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET TO WHEN THE CARSEAT IS ATTATCHED.
__label__pos	"""He enjoyed so much when I walked with him."""
__label__pos	"""He is only 2 months, so he is not old enough to bounce it, yet."""
__label__neg	I found this product had terrible static and made cracking/popping sounds.
__label__neu	This wrap is easy to use & fairly comfortable except that you are constantly having to adjust it tighter.
__label__pos	This sterilizer is absolutely wonderful, especially if you take your baby on the road, i.e.
__label__pos	He also loves it when I hold his legs up while he is in it, move him around in circles, and tell him he's in a flying saucer! =)
__label__neg	I followed all the directions, I was very careful and patient with this tub, I washed it and dried it after each use and still I find things growing in the crevices and between the top and bottom. 
__label__pos	She was too tiny for her arms to fit in the arm places, but it worked perfectly because she fit snugly and securely in the place that the body is supposed to go.
__label__neu	Given the choice, I would definitely purchase these over the Graco pack n play sheets which feel rougher and not as soft.
__label__neg	I CAN'T EVEN PUT MY DIAPER BAG IN THERE, I HAVE TO PUT IT IN BEFORE I ATTATCH THE CARSEAT AND THEN I CAN'T GET IT OUT.
__label__neg	The cloth on this cover already had some snags on it when we took it out of the package.
__label__neu	I keep this toilet seat in my son's bathroom along with the Bjorn step stool.
__label__neg	And the 'shelves' are a bit insecure. 
__label__pos	Love this mirror!
__label__neu	He would occasionally sit in it for 5 minutes or so but most of the time he would start wailing the minute I got him anywhere near it.
__label__pos	Easy to use - the elastic makes it easy to tuck around the seat.
__label__neg	 It leaks and is cheaply made
__label__neu	I have called customer service two times, and they have agreed to send a new case, but three weeks later I have not received the case.  
__label__pos	We're about to go on a trip and the portablility (case) is great.
__label__neg	I can't believe how much this shrunk once it was washed
__label__neu	The first time I used it,  I pulled a wipe out and noticed that they seemed a bit too warm for my baby's bum.
__label__neu	I tried it again this morning with an apple and couldn't get it to grate the apple at all.
__label__pos	I like this mobile, the leaves moving up and down, the animals slowly moving around.
__label__neu	I don't know if I received a factory reject,  or if the product is just not up to my standards.
__label__pos	"""Cup has never leaked and is easy to clean."""
__label__pos	We first used them to transition from the bottle which was plain easy with the soft spouts
__label__neg	I didn't use this much because my baby cried most of the time when I put her in the carrier.
__label__neg	This item is SO frustrating. 
__label__neu	I was given this as a baby shower gift.
__label__pos	i bought this when my twin sons were 4 months old and they're still using it at 8 months.
__label__pos	It's perfect.
__label__pos	We have enjoyed having the differentspeed settings and have never had trouble with strange motor sounds coming from the mobile.
__label__neg	it just has a bit of a learning curve.
__label__pos	So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me
__label__pos	I love it.
__label__neg	 Not to mention thiese clippers are sharp as can be
__label__neg	Just VERY hard to find.
__label__neg	Nothing works better than you own hands on your slippery baby anyway, and you can avoid sore knees from bathroom tile and stiff back from bending over the tub.
__label__neg	Also it is sufficiently complicated that you can't put it on while you hold the baby.
__label__pos	The caps are very handy unlike the little discs other bottles have for you to put in the bottle rings.
__label__neg	The only times I have had a problem with odors is if too many diapers are stuffed into the pail.
__label__neu	We bought this item to use in our nursery
__label__neu	 We'll see how well it lasts over the next couple of years
__label__neu	Hope this helps a bit
__label__neu	Even though I ended up bottle feeding,  I did try breastfeeding while using this pillow.
__label__neg	Unfortunately,  the screws used by the manufacturing company are so cheap,  we stripped them by lightly applying pressure with the screw driver
__label__neu	 This is because the sponge on this brush is denser than on other brushes. 
__label__pos	Also, the sound settings were great too. 
__label__neg	Cute, but that's about the extent of it
__label__neg	I have tried it with several kinds of drawer knobs and it doesn't work with any of them.
__label__neu	We now use an old clock radio tuned to AM static and it works better than anything else.
__label__neu	The highest swing setting was comparable to the lowest on my other swing.
__label__neu	We have this one and it is cute,  but I found out after it was purchased that using bumpers is not recommended due to the possibility of suffocation and SIDS.
__label__pos	This monitor works great
__label__neg	One time,  the urine stream made it fall off
__label__neu	 I am hoping it works out maybe for breastfeeding
__label__pos	IT IS TERRIFIC FOR LUGGING AROUND THE HOUSE AND TO GRANDMA'S TOO!
__label__pos	He loved it!
__label__neu	I received this item at my baby shower (11/03) and we still have it. 
__label__pos	We used to have our bottles just dry on a cloth, but this drying rack saves space and makes sterilising so much easier!
__label__neu	I had orignally registered for the 4 in 1 bath station.  
__label__neg	 I don't know why everyone says this one has no smell, I have both models (this and the Twistaway) and I MUCH prefer the original Twistaway
__label__neu	One night,  when the baby was fussing and my husband was trying to get some sleep,  I turned of the monitor in the babies room and we found out that the recievers will then pick up a country radio station
__label__neg	, my baby was done with it by week 3
__label__neg	 I ended up using this hammock-on-a-frame type thing I got for #1 when she was little and bathed him in a regular tub
__label__neg	Do not waste your money on the Diaper Genie.
__label__neg	 I only had it for three weeks when it stop working
__label__pos	 I also purchased the sterilizer which works great
__label__neu	Also if you have a summer baby the wipes will heat on their own with this summer we have been having. 
__label__pos	"""this carseat is the only one i've tried that does not move AT ALL once installed, not even the allowed 1 inch."""
__label__neu	 I thought that the back could be a little higher, he still needed some support, and couldn't sit straight up. 
__label__pos	"""I am so happy I switched."""
__label__neg	"""Thus: I am not sure of the product's usefulness."""
__label__neg	I thought this would be a wonderful way to be nice to our baby with the warmer wipes but it seems like they feel good when I initially open the door and get the wipe but it seems like they are already cold again by the time I start using it on the baby
__label__neg	a couple of times with a drink in it, once with a $4 latte that spilled everywhere. 
__label__pos	We absolutely can't say enough positive things about the Fisher Price Healthy Care Booster Seat.  
__label__neu	Not recommended.
__label__neu	"Now,  keep in mind that we use disposable ""chucks"" (those blue hospital disposable under pads) on top of this terry cloth changing pad"
__label__neg	Now it no longer works at all.
__label__neu	Also,  Target lost my order and eventually it arrived,  weeks late.
__label__pos	It has held up well and washes up well.
__label__neg	 Plus, the bag got stuck in the puddle. 
__label__neg	BE WARNED - Replacement nipples are $7
__label__pos	I do recommend this pail.
__label__neu	I am going to call the company, I really hope they make this right
__label__neu	Just go low-tech and skip this product.
__label__pos	"""We have had it now for months and I have moved it to be used more as ""nursery decor"" since he's too old to have it where he might pull it down."""
__label__neg	 Grrrrrr
__label__neu	The head blocks most accidents for boys. 
__label__neg	In my opinion,  don't waste your money,  just buy a standard cup holder
__label__pos	The great thing is the music is actually calming and not annoying.
__label__pos	"""My baby is one month old and we love the eurobath!"""
__label__pos	It helps with sponge bathing newborns and it keeps the baby warm when water is poored over it. 
__label__neg	That's my only complaint, but of course that meant we couldn't really use it.
__label__pos	We bought it over a year ago (with the extension) and have used it every day since.
__label__neg	Also, the vibration is really, really loud -- at least without a baby sitting in the seat.
__label__neu	Another reviewer said there are sharp edges.
__label__pos	We open the doors to access the PS3 games,  DVD player,  and remote controls on a daily basis and the magnet lock works wonderfully
__label__pos	"""Fits almost everything we need for clothes, and we have a diaper depot hanging off the side to fit all the changing table items."""
__label__neu	This reminds me of a product that might have been around when we were little, which is refreshing nowadays with the plethora of battery-driven, light-up toys, etc.
__label__neu	Only time will tell I suppose.
__label__pos	Excellent product, Philips!
__label__neg	I rented the Medela for 2 months before using it and believe me this thing does not compare, not even close. 
__label__neu	I would skip this tub and use bathe a newborn in the sink and then invest in a Primo tub. 
__label__pos	 My daughter loves this swing
__label__neg	 In February the motor went out and we had to get another one
__label__neu	I breast feed my daughter, so I used it right away in the hospital.
__label__neu	Unfortunately, it didn't work for my baby. 
__label__neg	"""The only complaints are the price and when the baby is an infant, even the slowest speed is fast for an infant."""
__label__pos	"""It was a wonderful present to receive in the beginning of my pregnancy and I recommend it to anyone who wants to congratulate a friend, daughter or sister, etc."""
__label__neu	, you won't hear the vacuum cleaner or the dryer or the neighbor's dog barking, etc
__label__neg	"As someone else pointed out,  most of the time you end up with what my husband and I refer to as ""the giant poo-poo sack"" because no matter how many times you twist that first diaper,  the next one you put in just falls on top of it"
__label__neg	The mat itself is pretty slippery, not too much traction on it.
__label__neu	"""I bought this for my daughter who is very colicky and hates her car seat."""
__label__pos	"""It's VERY easy to use: so easy to use, you will learn to use it (believe me, this is important) &quot;in your sleep&quot;."""
__label__neg	 I pumped & pumped & pumped & hardly got any milk
__label__neg	 I'm returning it
__label__neg	"""That being said, I am now selling mine b/c I don't want to buy the expensive refills anymore."""
__label__pos	I just hold it further away from her and she likes to look at it.
__label__neu	The vent system in these bottles virtual eliminates any air from getting to your baby's tummy.
__label__pos	It pumps pretty quickly and is easy to travel with.
__label__neu	Was huge enuf to hold the biggest bottle of garnier conditioner bottle,  shampoo bottles,  loofahs etc.. But in a week or so,  the sticker with which it was attached to the shower wall,  came off and the whole thing crashed into the tub.. Now its jus sitting in the bathroom occupying the space n not of any use.
__label__neg	But, one week after we attached it to the car seat, it started leaking! 
__label__pos	I highly recommend this seat!
__label__pos	The handles are ideal for small hands and our daughter loves to shake it and hear it jingle.  
__label__pos	My baby loves, loves, loves this swing
__label__pos	He loves the teather ring.
__label__neu	USE CAUTION
__label__pos	I don't have to worry about our little one climbing it because there are no foot holds, just clear plastic.  
__label__pos	It soothes when you bounce it and baby really responds to the musical moving bar - so did I when I saw it in the store! 
__label__neg	he likes the giraffe one much better....so lesson learned.
__label__pos	He loves to chew on them and suck on them (ew!).
__label__neg	 She is a real squirmer and easily would break out of regular swaddles so I thought this thing would be a good idea but it turned out to be too dangerous
__label__neu	 The whole process took about 20-30 minutes
__label__neu	"Surely being the most ridiculously expensive with all the highlighted bubbles beside features like ""clear reception"" and ""no interference"" I would be able to hear the baby's every move from every household location and beyond."
__label__neg	 all the small parts wind up in the middle where it is harder to get to them. 
__label__pos	I am obsessed with my Swaddle Designs blankets, and use them exclusively to swaddle my 4 1/2 month old for every nap & every night
__label__neu	"""He came home at just over 6 pounds and 20 inches long (long and lanky), so the newborn size still seemed a little bulky (although he did not seem to care)."""
__label__pos	In the long run, the refills are much cheaper than the other brands and it's well worth the money to not have to waste your time on flimsy grocery-store bags - they simply can't contain the stink - find another use for them - line your other waste pails with them.  Diapers need special attention, and the Diaper Dekor Plus fits the bill!I HIGHLY recommend this stylish, practical and cost-effective disposal system!
__label__neu	It's much easier (and less costly and less stressful and less time consuming) to use the bare changing pad and simply wipe down any messes with diaper wipes or with a gentle cleanser.
__label__neg	Cons:1. Flow was insanely fast for my son from 2wks all the way to 6wks.  
__label__pos	He had very little gas, he adapted to the nipple VERY  easily, and they are easy for him to hold now that he's older.  
__label__pos	But it was worth it for my piece of mind to switch to a non-BPA sippy
__label__neg	The shower portion of it stopped working after the second use.
__label__pos	Super soft.
__label__neg	 Don't bother
__label__pos	"BUY THIS AND DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON OTHER CARRIERS"
__label__neu	I have the Medela microsteam bags for when I am away.
__label__pos	I was very excited to get this sling
__label__neu	As a new mother, I wanted to get everything that would make the baby comfortable
__label__pos	I used this carrier from the time my baby was 3 weeks and still use it now that she is seven months.
__label__neg	Unless you have a changing station (or crib, wherever you want to hang it) that has slits or slots able to hold it - the velcro will NOT hold it well. 
__label__neu	She would sleep in it the first 3 months (it helped keep her upright). 
__label__neg	 I also tried using these at a day care I worked at and other babies had the same problem the nipple on them is to firm so it takes longer for the baby to suck milk out and by the time they are done their jaw is tired
__label__neg	 Neither did mine
__label__neg	Cannot return because it is openedI am stuck with it.. 
__label__pos	"BUT: while it is not rocket science to put it on, it takes some ""experience"" to do it one handed, with the baby in the other...I sure would recommend it at least until the new mom figures out how to nurse the ""relaxed"" way, with the baby in your lap."
__label__neu	My baby is an Advent baby.
__label__neu	Despite the concerns about BPA we are using these bottles for our daughter and using canned formula to supplement breastfeeding.
__label__neu	We stared my son on a bottle of breast milk at 15 days old.
__label__neg	 My daughter is 10 months now and I have already bought another monitor
__label__neu	It dries out very quickly and doesn't mildew.
__label__pos	The Diaper Champ is the best we found!There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!
__label__neg	Snoogle's cover had to be washed.
__label__neu	All of our videos of her are on this mat.
__label__pos	"""The actual mirror surface is big and the mirror is convex."""
__label__pos	This Mobile is perfect for newborns.  
__label__pos	This mirror is easy to install but it does throw you off b/c the straps are backwards but if you twist one then it works great.
__label__neg	.
__label__neu	I had been putting off getting a swing because they are expensive and I felt my girl would outgrow it very quickly but I was not getting anything done trying to keep her occupied and I cracked, ran out and bought this.
__label__pos	She's 4 months old and we still use it.
__label__pos	Love it, love it, love it!
__label__neu	A lot of reviews for the earlier version of this cup said they leaked but I haven't had that issue (yet).
__label__neg	If you're wondering if this should be an item on the 'must have ' list then the answer is NO WAY
__label__neg	 His legs looked like they were losing circulation, so I had to take him out
__label__pos	I decided on this tub and I have to say I am very happy.
__label__neg	I took the bag out of the freezer and into the fridge to thaw and ended up with a shelf full of breastmilk
__label__pos	This monitor is fantastic. 
__label__pos	She would hold onto the handle and suck cube uppon cube of ice until her pains were relieved.
__label__neg	I bought these glass bottles after reading all the articles about bispenol A
__label__pos	seek out the old version!
__label__neg	I wouldn't buy them again.
__label__pos	"""The thing I liked best about this album was watching my son progress from pointing out the cute animals to learing the sounds they make as well as thier colors, and then to recognizing the people in the photographs."""
__label__neu	I received this from my mother-in-law (she bought every conceivable accessory for our stroller
__label__neg	I meant not only a part of the comb,  the whole edge of the comb is sharp.
__label__neg	Apparently you have to screw the cap on just right- which is really difficult at 3 AM
__label__neg	"""We purchased it directly at the store which I see was wise since shipping can be so expensive."""
__label__neg	We tried this placemat along with the disposable ones and neither worked for us
__label__neg	Definitely NOT for under 1 year olds. 
__label__pos	My baby is 8 months (not sure why they labeled this 6 months...) and this is one of her favorite teethers.
__label__neu	I bought this bottle warmer after reading the ratings and thought that I could prevent the metal disc from activating itself.  
__label__neu	I know the answer to that one -> ME!
__label__neu	 I found it for several dollars less at Target
__label__pos	 I don't know truly if it has to do with the swaddler but he is swaddled and sleeping soundly each night. 
__label__pos	"""Pricey, but worth it for the security of not having your child falling down stairs."""
__label__pos	Well,  I got what I DIDN'T pay for
__label__neu	I was appalled that these were considered soft enough or absorbent at all to be put close to my baby.
__label__neu	The nice thing about the child unit is that it attaches to the crib-you just lock it onto the top bar and then unlock it when you need to take it off to recharge
__label__neg	 It's not great however for nursing. 
__label__neg	 It basically just serves as a very expensive wipes holder
__label__pos	 My baby also like sitting in it better than the boppy.
__label__neu	I ordered this product thinking it would be great if I could pump directly into the bottles we'd be feeding our baby with, eliminates a step right?
__label__neg	 Attempt to move a couple rooms away, or to the outdoors, and you'll spend more time trying to find the signal for the monitor than getting a much-needed break while baby sleeps
__label__pos	"""In addition, it's very easy to use."""
__label__neu	Best for 15+ lb babies
__label__neu	The front pouch holds my stuff (keys cell phone etc) and I keep sunglasses and a water bottle in the side pockets.
__label__neg	It gets 4 stars because I think it takes way too long to heat up a bottle.
__label__neg	 The top half of the sleeper is great, formed out of a rigid plastic tray, but the bottom half is just the this foam mattress with no support underneath
__label__pos	My children are 12 years apart and I wish they would have had this item with my first.
__label__neg	After washing 3-4 times with loads of fabric softener - no difference
__label__pos	The Snuzzler is the perfect accessory for an infant car seat, especially for newborns and preemies.
__label__neu	"""The closer your monitor's frequency is to that of another device, such as a cordless phone, the more likely you'll hear static or cross talk."""
__label__neu	First of all the gate was not that simple to install,  I had to go online to watch the video.
__label__pos	"""I dont need any others seeing tha tmy house is VERY baby proof."""
__label__neu	If want attractive and pretty then this isn't the thing for you however if you want a sturdy carrier that gets the job done.
__label__neg	"""Needless to say, the milk just ran down our baby's chin every time."""
__label__neu	I even put air fresheners in and near it....
__label__neu	However we found it very difficult for just one of us to get him in it.
__label__pos	It's ok but not something one needs
__label__neg	I was just about to buy this for my 3 month old when I noted a warning label-it stated that this toy is not intended for children under 3 years of age
__label__neu	"""We keep one hung on the diaper/travel bag and one for home use."""
__label__pos	The thing I like the most is the light show, which keeps my baby's attention. 
__label__pos	This is a cute toy, I will give them that. 
__label__neu	I just use my Ultimate Crib Sheets
__label__pos	Best in its category!
__label__neu	My boy just squirmed until he freed a hand and then ruined all my attempts at a burrito wrap! 
__label__neg	"""Moreover, the sound of the pictures moving is VERY loud."""
__label__neg	Even with those precautions, sometimes they stay down; sometimes they don't.
__label__neu	We just set up our son's nursery and tested out the Sony monitor.
__label__neg	I have the Avent Isis but wanted something I could pump directly into the Soothie bottles stupid choice the Avent is about 10000 times better even with more parts to clean well worth the time and money  With the Avent Isis I can pump 6-10 oz in 5 minutes this one I was lucky to get an ounce in 5 minutes don't waste your money.
__label__pos	Now she is 2 months and she still loves the woombie. 
__label__neu	That was until my son was in the car crying because he is used to seeing his beautiful face
__label__neu	When my daughter was a baby (she is 5 now) I used the 4-in-1 from the first years, it worked alright until it broke (over zellest dad) Then we tried the 4-in-1 from safety first, my daughter who was average size leaned forward to get a toy and fell in to the waterface first with her legs stuck under the ring.
__label__neg	UPDATE, 1/2014: I would not recommend this dresser
__label__pos	I got this because I also purchased 2 other items from Tiny Love and thought very highly of the concept behind their products. 
__label__pos	"""After a few attempts to fine tune the viewing angles so I could see the road behind me and my baby I found a good position."""
__label__neu	Anyhow...
__label__neg	First of all this thing dries out wipes even if you do add the 1/4 cup of water you're supposed to add every couple of days!
__label__neg	I have to keep it on the charger all night so it doesn't go out
__label__neu	But the main reason I decided to buy the Ergo is it's lack of dangling staps.  
__label__neu	what I hated most
__label__neu	So, I place it on a folded face towel and that seems to work.
__label__pos	The main compartment is unzipped from the top and there is lots of room for cloths clothes and the diaper pad pouch.
__label__neg	Both times the rung popped right out breaking at the top and bottom
__label__pos	A GREAT purchase!!
__label__neg	 The baby is able to wiggle down despite it being velcro and TIGHT. 
__label__pos	"""It's one of the things I can't do without now."""
__label__pos	The Magic Blanket is a much better product,  and I can even do a better job swaddling traditionally,  with a large,  lightweight blanket
__label__neu	Of course, we thought so. 
__label__pos	The idea of the bottles is good.
__label__neu	"Then a friend of hers told her that the ""My Brest Friend"" nursing pillow was much better. "
__label__neu	I started out trying to give my newborn daughter this pacifier.
__label__pos	"""I wasn't something we needed to use for too long but for the time we did she really enjoyed it."""
__label__neu	 maybe this would work for newborns but not when they're a bit older. 
__label__neu	"Enough so that the pediatrician scheduled an appt at 3 months to look at it & possibly talk about ""the helmet."""
__label__neu	This bath tub is humongous.
__label__neg	yet
__label__neu	For those of you with wireless internet,  apparently the 2
__label__neg	They leak and are awkward to hold.
__label__neu	It is a black hole!
__label__neg	 I returned it
__label__neg	When women can buy nearly customized bras based on chest width and cup size, it's ridiculous to have a
__label__pos	i just wish i could've found these earlier. 
__label__pos	"""1)  It LOOKS happier and more kid-friendly than most of the other options out there..."""
__label__neg	 don't buy here. 
__label__pos	We could stick her in it for hours (NOT THAT WE WOULD LOL!) and she would be happy.
__label__neu	I bought 3 of these.
__label__pos	Other than that, it had everything we needed.
__label__pos	This carrier is AWESOME!
__label__neg	 And Avent knows it
__label__neu	Sometimes he felt the need to shake or grp on them
__label__pos	 I ended up using the Diaper Champ and was really happy with that diaper pail - no special bags required and all you do is drop the diaper in and flip the handle over.
__label__pos	He's napping in it right now.
__label__neg	So,  if you live close to people on cellphones or cordless phones (we live in a townhouse) it can be very frustrating
__label__pos	 He likes to free his hands at night but the blanket keeps him covered and warm and it kind of hugs him.
__label__pos	"""(A side note- it doesn't attach to my crib because of the chunky rails around the top but my mom attached it to the bumper and it is very secure.)"""
__label__neu	Now we are making the transition to the Eurobath, which I recommend now that she's a little bigger.
__label__neu	"""First, she just stared at the fish and listened to the music."""
__label__pos	Now I am attaching it to a chair and he loves it either way.
__label__neu	The parts should come apart easily.  
__label__pos	Pretty colors,  remote control,  several classical tunes
__label__neu	We didn't mind toting this stroller about until it was time to use it.
__label__pos	I recommend it
__label__neu	Big mistake.
__label__pos	Will likely get another for home and keep this one in the care for outings only.
__label__neu	I really can't stress this.
__label__neu	then she all of a sudden decided that she didn't want to take it anymore
__label__neg	Overall, I would not recommend this blanket.
__label__pos	These are truely great bottles and they dont leak either!
__label__pos	"""This is a perfect tub for any baby...."""
__label__neg	 I was planning on returning Bjorn to get my big $$$ back
__label__neg	 I am not going to let my baby chew on this since I am not too sure the FDA isn't 'in bed' with Exxon. 
__label__neg	We don't use it for sleep assistance currently.
__label__neg	I received this off my baby shower registry.
__label__neg	I am used to the operation of Diaper Genie  and do not find it that difficult to use
__label__neg	A few times I'd forget to change it (I change it my husband takes it out to the trash) and if a FULL bag of stinky diapers is left for more than a few days it does begin to smell but ANY diaper pail would stink if it was full for more than a few days.
__label__neg	Also, be careful when you look behind you, when you change lanes.
__label__pos	My son is picky about teething toys, but he actually enjoyed this one.
__label__neu	Maybe it's the softness.
__label__pos	it's the best tub, and very affordable!
__label__neu	"""My Mom bought this rocker to keep at her house for my baby."""
__label__neu	"""He went to cut it and it pulled in his hand, tearing the entire vinyl side apart on top and side so that the foam core was completely exposed."""
__label__neg	I figure it can't be any worse,  LOL
__label__neg	 This was a huge disappointment
__label__pos	I love this monitor.  
__label__neg	 It looks like it'd be so much fun, but my daughter doesn't seem to care for it at all
__label__pos	"""Since we live far away, she figured that she'd get more use out of this rocker than a traditional bouncer."""
__label__pos	Love this stroller.
__label__pos	It takes most of the weight off your back and it's very easy to take on and off.
__label__neu	 I had to prop pillows under both sides to try to get it right. 
__label__neu	"""My daughter is a month old and she has been sleeping on it since we got home from the hospital."""
__label__neu	And if we want to watch TV I can put her on the floor with this chair (so me watching and feeding her at the same time.
__label__neu	I don't know why the previous poster said it took them a half hour to blow up!?
__label__neu	That is the ONLY swaddle that keeps a baby properly contained
__label__neu	Once I finally took her pants off she went right away.
__label__neu	But under sunlight that triangle is green.2.
__label__pos	I gave it 4 stars because it looks nice and it does do the job its supposed to do (entertain my daughter) which is the most important thing to me.
__label__neu	Use Hydrocortisone 1% and it works wonderfully well for eczema
__label__neg	 The headrest is a must
__label__neu	it lays back enough that he sleeps,  but not too much that I worry about spit up
__label__neu	 I'm using a SwaddleMe now and it works much better, it can't bunch up around the neck
__label__neu	Personally, I think she worries too much, but I'm a little more careful in wrapping him.
__label__neu	I gave it a fair try,  but I had to go out and buy another bath.
__label__pos	I really like dthat you get the brush, pacifier and two sizes of bottle in the newborn set.
__label__neu	"""First, I have to say if you are considering getting a Keekaroo high chair, do it!"""
__label__neg	If you are washing it on warm your water temp may be too high(hot water heater) so that may be causing it to shrink.
__label__pos	My daughter loves it and it puts her to sleep almost every time.
__label__pos	its a good buy if you have a small house/apartment!
__label__neu	I purchased these bags when I returned to work and began pumping more often.
__label__pos	This item works great for us!
__label__neg	 The entire system just isn't durable or made for much use. 
__label__pos	 So okay binky
__label__pos	I finally decided to buy it and I am glad I did.
__label__neu	I did a search and came across this stroller. After reading reviews I decided to give it a try. 
__label__neg	The contoured shape just made it awkward to deal with.  
__label__neg	 Then taking drastic measures (realizing that it ruins the chance of return but hoping to keep this oh so cute box) i dunked it into a cold bath
__label__neu	After trying just about every single BPA free sippy on the market, I finally bit the bullet and bought a Foogo.  
__label__neg	I read the reviews about the smell but since most of the reviews were positive I hoped that was an old (solved) problem
__label__pos	I also like that it's cotton, and it seems like a good weight and well constructed.
__label__neg	Shabby-Chic...
__label__pos	"""Positive Aspects:"""
__label__pos	"""and he's really picky."""
__label__pos	Definately worth the small initial investment
__label__neu	I stopped using them and moved on to the miracle blanket which is made of a thin cotton material.
__label__pos	"""We used it regularly when our babies were newborns ..."""
__label__pos	The drop-in bags turned out to be a great benefit of the bottles also. 
__label__neu	probably the most irritating thing about the Cosco is trying to adjust the straps and tighten them and Britax is a piece of cake.
__label__pos	These are a great shower gift.
__label__pos	He seemed to delight in the fact that by waving around his arms, he could hit the toys and cause the music and lights to go off.
__label__neu	When you are trying to squeeze the air out (which takes what seems like forever when you have a screaming baby anyway),  sometimes they bust and you have to start all over...not to mention a waste of expensive formula or breastmilk.
__label__neu	I feel badly for the waste of money but the bags are SO much easier.
__label__pos	They help to make my extremely firm crib mattress a little cozier for my son.
__label__neu	It costs twice the price of this pump, but it sucks really gentle but strong enough (you can adjust the strength of pumping) with a sort of vibration. 
__label__neg	"""I didn't get the fuzz or the odor with this as the other user did."""
__label__neu	In fact, in the photo on the box it came in, that is exactly what they show it being used with.
__label__neu	I took the suggestion of the other reviewers that said they got these free and I have a pair coming to me as well from Medela...Save the money and call their 1-800 number and get a free pair...
__label__neg	 We switched to the Playtex VentAire bottles when she was 6 weeks old, and problem solved
__label__neu	"""We bought this when my son was big enough to be stable in it."""
__label__neu	It does use up a lot of batteries so keep extra on hand, but it is worth it!!!
__label__neg	You HAVE to remember that.
__label__pos	a must have - buy 2!
__label__neu	Rather that washing the bottle you can just change the liner and wash the nipple.
__label__pos	 And it made the water come into the tub nicely as well
__label__neg	deducted one star because unit does not have the continuous play feature.
__label__neg	This toy doesn't stay together well. 
__label__pos	In fact i bought extra sets to leave at the grandparent's houses!
__label__neg	 If you attempt to move about with the reciever it crackles with static, beeps that it's lost the signal, and generally makes such a ruckus that it's better for waking the baby than monitoring her
__label__neu	He gnawed that thing to death. 
__label__neu	This does not convert to a play area so if this is a future consideration then get the original. 
__label__neu	My baby ended up being her own baby care timer
__label__pos	Even her older siblings (5 & 4) love to rearrange all the toys and keep it interesting for her.  
__label__neu	My daughter is weaning herself now,  but she was able to use the pillow for a little over a year
__label__pos	I love my Diaper Champ
__label__pos	"""I love Bumpkins bibs!"""
__label__neg	These sheets are so itchy it is unbelievable.
__label__neg	It's too heavy to clip on anything
__label__neg	"""We tried to face it the other way, but when you pull the cord for music, it just pulls right off of the velcro strips you use to attach the hanging toys."""
__label__pos	Great buy!
__label__pos	"""This significantly reduces leakage of urine on the overnight."""
__label__neg	It isn't designed well, and it doesn't function properly. 
__label__pos	I like the ability to set the timer for it to turn off and I like that the music isn't obnoxious.
__label__neu	I took this on a short trip,  it proved useless.
__label__pos	"""My daughter is almost a year old now and I still use them, every night."""
__label__neu	I really did not like this.
__label__pos	"""My baby LIKES this bouncer."""
__label__neu	When I first saw it in the store my mother and I laughed! 
__label__pos	No crying!
__label__pos	Overall the dresser is decent for how much it costs
__label__pos	 I had the Snoogle for my first pregnancy and it was great
__label__pos	"""It is also nice to prop my daughter in."""
__label__neg	My daughter loves to play with it,  but has so far absolutely refused to drink out of it,  defeating the purpose
__label__neg	 It looks great but I can't say anything else positive about it
__label__pos	"""Before we had this, I was her Jumperoo - holding her for hours while bouncing on an exercise ball (not great on the back!)- and this seemed to solve all her problems!"""
__label__pos	Love it!
__label__neu	In any case, it certainly doesn't hurt to have an extra tool around.
__label__neu	She naws on this thing like crazy.  
__label__neu	There isn't much activity other than the vibrating chair,  and watching the water bubble up to music or sounds.
__label__neu	 I don't think we got a lemon
__label__pos	"""will let you know how that works out."""
__label__pos	"""At first I thought I was being a tad frivolous by registering for this, but I'm so glad I did!"""
__label__pos	I find it very useful when I have to take milk or liquid with me that I don't need right away.
__label__neg	 I didn't bother to listen as the first tune was just dire
__label__neu	One thing though... 
__label__neu	I was so excited when I found it!
__label__pos	 We ended up getting an Ergo and are much happier with it. 
__label__neg	It may have for the first week or two, but now at 3 1/2 months it SMELLS BAD.
__label__neg	I would not recommend this product unless your baby is not heavy and you have a strong back
__label__neu	We painted our son's room blue and got every piece to this set. 
__label__neu	It would not be easy for her to get off to use the restroom on her own anyway
__label__neu	I down right hate it,  don't buy it!
__label__pos	I also think that BB would be easier on the back but so far I havent used it for very long periods of time like 1/2 hr and I have yet to have any back pain.
__label__pos	I highly recommend this kit for parents and to make those one-of-a-kind keepsake gifts.
__label__neu	From what I've seen,  there are basically 3 methods used to eliminate/reduce gas in bottles
__label__pos	"In case anyone else is in that position, here are my two cents:GET THIS PUMP (OR ANOTHER HIGH-END ONE) IF...- You're going back to work- Your milk supply is medium to low- You plan to pump more than two or three times per month- You are opposed to giving your baby any formula, ever (with this pump you could build up ""reserve"" breastmilk in case of an emergency)TRY A CHEAPER ONE IF...- You have a very abundant milk supply- You only plan to pump one or twice a month- You wouldn't mind giving your baby formula if you had to be away from her for an extended period"
__label__pos	These were by far my sons favorite bottles.  
__label__neu	The need to carefully and only partially unzip the packaging for the nipples is tedious.
__label__neg	The main problem we found was that our little guy was able to catapult himself upwards so easily when he would kick against the part of the tub that holds the washcloth/soap/etc.
__label__neg	 This warmer needs to be plugged in to stay warm and when unplugged does not stay warm for long. 
__label__pos	"""It is the best!"""
__label__neu	The booster with tray can be quite front heavy,  so please be sure you only attach it to a very sturdy and preferably wide chair
__label__neg	Washed it once according to directions & it shrunk beyond belief
__label__neu	Get rechargable batteries!
__label__pos	 hides odors
__label__neg	 I've found using liners and just five covers works great for me
__label__neu	We understand that you need to make sure that the surface is clean and smooth and that the suction cup is fully rinsed before trying to stick it down each time.
__label__neg	I will never buy another squirty bath toy
__label__neg	 For example, these cost THREE times as much as the Dr Browns replacement nipples
__label__neg	I could get cheaper ones at target and Carter's Baby and to me that was good enough.
__label__neu	Now,  supposedly this warmer can be used with Dr
__label__pos	ALL bottles nipples containers jars teethers small toys fit in this.
__label__neu	 Brown's when our son began suffering from gas and nipple confusion, since I am nursing
__label__pos	The front wheels can be locked for pushing over grass or other rougher surfaces, and surprisingly it works really well.
__label__neg	 The inserts are very inefficient in pulling moisture away from the baby's  bottom. 
__label__neu	The suction cups are constantly coming off and the whole shade falls off which does not seem too safe if baby is sitting under it.
__label__neg	And the worst part - I didn't realize the twist-ties were cutting into the sides of the bags on more than one occasion
__label__neu	O.
__label__neg	 I can't even see my daughter now because the mirror is coated with something which won't come off
__label__pos	The insulated cup keeps fluids fresher longer, which makes this the HEALTHIEST cup delivering optimum nutrients and nutrition for your child!  
__label__pos	it seems like a good product for little ones who are just starting out on solids
__label__pos	Awesome mirror
__label__neg	 I should have paid the money and bought that one in the first place
__label__neg	It is boring.
__label__neg	 The medicine dropper is TOO hard to pull out and push in. 
__label__neg	 I noticed that the material frayed around the elastic after a few months of use
__label__neg	The music is ok, but none of the music is listed under the correct composer, that isn't a serious problem at all, but something worth noting.
__label__pos	This bathtub is great!
__label__neu	I Only rate this item 4 Stars because I just purchased it today.  
__label__neu	The bottles are expensive so I thought they must be good bottles
__label__pos	"""This is one product that definitely lives up to all of the hype!"""
__label__neu	He loves to kick and splash and doesn't have the room he needs.
__label__neu	 I would only recommend this item if you are looking for a dresser that looks nice but don't need a lot of storage space
__label__neu	I purchased this item thinking it would be perfect for those late night diaper changes. 
__label__neg	In comparison the Fisher Price 900mhz Long Range Monitor sounded excellent.
__label__neg	I am returning this today to try a different brand!
__label__neg	We gave up on using this within a week, and just put him in bed with us until we could buy an Arms Reach Mini Cosleeper
__label__pos	The price was unbeatable and I didnt realize when I bought it that it converts to a toddler bed and it came with a trundle drawer which was a nice little surprise.
__label__neu	I received this tub as a gift at my baby shower
__label__neg	This pump will pull and tug at your nipple just as much as the next one, and because it's clear, you can see how much of your PRECIOUS breastmilk has been lost and stuck in the mechanical aspects of the pump.
__label__neg	I do not advise getting this gate if you plan on putting it up and taking it down often. 
__label__pos	It's very snuggly for him and is so easy to put in/take out of the car seat as well as wash.
__label__neu	I have noticed that since my trip my stroller doesn't stand on its own as well either.
__label__pos	" well, if you happen to be married to a very determined ""handy man"", it can be done"
__label__pos	If you are ok with that, then it's fine. 
__label__neg	I do wish the white plastic dome piece stayed on better but that is a very minor complaint.
__label__pos	He does enjoy chewing on the lid though so I guess there's that.
__label__neg	 That one is so much better and no loud motor
__label__neg	 When I turn it upside down, milk comes rapidly dripping out right away (no, nipple does not appear to be damaged)- It's a nice big nipple, but not really like a breast
__label__neg	I would not buy this potty again. 
__label__neu	Don't get me wrong, the Ergo is super easy - but coming down from the BabyHawk, all the straps and adjustments that have to be made each time you put it on can seem a bit cumbersome.  
__label__pos	It gives him a cushy padding that makes his bath more pleasurable.
__label__neg	I started out using the 1 oz cubes,  but had a problem with the lids always popping open
__label__pos	It is easy to clean and I like how well the chair pad has come through the wash.
__label__pos	"""Very bright and colorful."""
__label__pos	"""I didn't want to put my kids in some institutional-looking cage."""
__label__neg	After my daughter had grown into it,  she was able to get her arms out and it was never very snug,  so she wouldn't like it very much
__label__neu	I would buy Sophie again here at Amazon if we lost her. 
__label__neg	 I wish I got other toppers instead
__label__neg	Still kind of boring, rough plastic edges (scratch your child and your hardwood floors), and forget about rolling on carpet at all-- that requires monumental effort, even from an adult. 
__label__neu	 Hope this helps any new mommy's out there
__label__neu	The volume control is also handy, I turn the volume up when he is just sitting there to keep him entertained; and I turn the volume down lower when I want him to go to sleep.
__label__neu	I bought this swing through Amazon.com about 4 months ago. 
__label__pos	"""I don't empty mine until it is full and have never had a stinky house(I am a clean freak)."""
__label__pos	"""THey are awesome!"""
__label__pos	"""This is just a minor inconvenience though, and doesn't take away from the awesomeness of the bottles."""
__label__pos	"""She loves lying in it and looking around the room, and it slightly elevates her head so she's not flat on her back."""
__label__pos	I think this is a must have for all new parents and babies!
__label__neu	As for the extra effort to clean the parts it only takes about a minute longer so it's really no big deal to me.
__label__neu	The diaper bag clipped to the suitcase handle and rested in the car seat.Yes, security is difficult no matter what, but I simply un-hooked only the top of the 3 clips and slid the straps down the suitcase.
__label__pos	This feature is particularly nice if your child sips a little here and a little there- esp. MILK which spoils quickly.
__label__neg	 Overall, this pump was very messy
__label__neu	Four stars. 
__label__neu	I bought this for my son a couple of years ago.
__label__pos	Whenever we go out to eat, we take this in.
__label__pos	PERFECT
__label__pos	"""The car seat is also at a great raised height so baby is nice and close to you."""
__label__neu	"We dress him in something with long sleeves so that his arms stay warm and during the colder winter nights we added ""No-Scratch Mittens"" from Babies R Us to keep his hands warm."
__label__pos	i can get about 4 diapers, towel, wipes, 2 change of clothes, baby cream.
__label__neu	"""I do suggest, however, that you read carefully and follow the directions included with these bottles."""
__label__neg	However, I think the same rings true about any folding seat cover since I have used about every one on the market and they all have the same flaws
__label__neu	I went to a craft store &amp; bought some for cheap &amp; installed it myself (used a towel as a 'liner' the first 2 baths).  
__label__pos	It's really comfortable for my child and I and SO easy to use even it looks complicated. It only takes me seconds to put it on. 
__label__pos	The pro to the monitor is that it picks up the smallest sounds.
__label__neg	You have to put the whole cooler in the freezer...Who has room in their freezer/fridge for that?
__label__neu	Not at all.
__label__neg	My only complaint is the way it attaches to the crib it's a bit awkward and it damaged the wood finish a little however a little padding under it has solved the problem.
__label__pos	"I do believe that, ""you get what you pay for"" so I do not expect this hamper to last years and years but for now it serves it's purpose and is very cute.  "
__label__pos	"""We get much longer periods of sleep as a result."""
__label__neg	 And if you are at a resturant, it is far easier to just ask for some warm water
__label__neu	Nice but Organic?
__label__pos	The teether on it is a bonus!
__label__neg	"""Maybe it is b/c I am big breasted but these did not work (loved the Avent ones though)"""
__label__neu	Maybe he likes the extra warmth.
__label__pos	Sure, real jewelry is better, but in the meantime, this is great!
__label__pos	Nice product...
__label__neg	 I changed batteries thinking that was the problem but the next day it stop working again
__label__pos	The good thing about these is that you can pump directly into them and freeze them. 
__label__neu	 The nail clipper is too big for my daughter little The comb it's OK
__label__neu	Again,  I am reminded of how delicate every drop of milk was
__label__neg	I think it's useless
__label__pos	"""I love it!!"""
__label__neg	It is a bit of a hassle to get all the pieces in the dishwasher.
__label__neg	These were not thick enough for me to use as a burp cloth, let alone the
__label__neg	 and, yes, I realize it's only for baby-sized objects, but it's just proportioned wrong
__label__pos	These take up far less room and are much easier to clean too.
__label__neg	 I do appreciate that the warning label is listed for this product; however, it would be very easy for someone to not see the warning since you have to scroll down to see it
__label__neu	And insist on it if you're visiting others (we are often too polite for our own good
__label__pos	It worked great!
__label__neg	"""It takes my husband AND I to bathe him b/c the tub offers no help."""
__label__neg	Be careful to consider how each item will fit for your application before buying.
__label__pos	"""While it may not have the strongest motor, it has plenty of other options that make it a good buy."""
__label__pos	Very very helpful little device especially in the middle of the night and when parents are on the run and trading off baby duties
__label__neg	The squirt holes are recessed so the toys can't be completely emptied of water
__label__neu	I tossed it in the closet and used regular bed and couch pillows instead.
__label__pos	(just read the instructions a couple of times and watch the video  on-line if you think you'll have trouble)The seat fits well forward facing in our car.
__label__neg	Anyhow the cheaper ones never really took off, the sleeves on the Carter's ones never fit him properly and were too warm, the bags were also not that big and constricted him so using them was always a battle.
__label__neg	A lot of the other items I've found pretty useless to me.
__label__neu	Would be better to choose a lighter color that could go into the same load as the rest of the baby's laundry
__label__pos	We used this hamper for nearly nine months for my daughter and it has been great.
__label__pos	If baby's diaper leaks it only gets on this sheet.
__label__neg	So, be forwarned about it
__label__neg	However,  this thing is not even CLOSE to being loud enough to qualify as white noise
__label__pos	Since then I have found that I even like to use it at home also.
__label__pos	Much lighter than a double stroller, mom and dad found the ability to head off in different directions at the store a great feature.
__label__pos	Highly recommend it.
__label__neg	 First of all, the bottles flowed too fast causing my son to choke and gag with every couple of swallows
__label__neg	"""I called Skip Hop for tips and they recommended sending an email, I did, and they NEVER replied."""
__label__neu	Go Amazon!
__label__neg	 The car seat does not lock onto anything, but merely rests on the bar
__label__neu	My 16 month old daughter pulls them up with ease. 
__label__neu	I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talkinga bout
__label__neu	I would recommend purchasing 2 covers.
__label__pos	Most importantly, the bags are super easy to change!
__label__neg	My handles haven't come off but they leak from the joints. 
__label__neg	 Perhaps it was because we washed them in the dishwasher
__label__neg	This version is too thin to serve as either a burp cloth or for diapering.
__label__neg	We returned it and found that just hanging little animals on the bar are better than swinging a heavy mobile an inch or two from her face!
__label__neu	I promptly threw away the awful bulb and haven't looked back.
__label__neu	we have one on our single and two on the double
__label__neg	 Arghh
__label__neu	I got this stroller for a international trip back to the USA with my 2 1/2 year old.  
__label__neu	It is just as easy to install an instant hot water thingy on your faucet and make a warm bottle in seconds.
__label__pos	It's super easy to use and my son loves it!
__label__neg	 Since my daughter has/had some reflux and gas issues, it was a no-go for us. 
__label__neg	I have to place a towel behind her head b/c the hard plastic is at such a sharp angle it's uncomfortable.
__label__neu	"""I purchased this for my 9 month old daughter who fights me every time I try to clip or file her nails."""
__label__pos	"""This is great because when we have future company we can reactivate them and the home is childproof again."""
__label__pos	It has been great!
__label__pos	"""We washed the bumper, curtains, drapes and sheets and all came out great."""
__label__neu	It's a good product that's probably a bit overpriced.
__label__neg	 We had our car seats inspected and the police officers doing the inspection said not to use these liners
__label__pos	 For the price, I think that they were, in retrospect, quite a good buy
__label__neu	At around 5 months old, my youngest could bounce slowly in the jumperoo, and by 6-months-old, she was bouncing like crazy!
__label__neg	I really do not care for these bottles
__label__pos	These bottles are great if you are not in a hurry to have your baby bottle fed and do support breastfeeding.
__label__neu	Whenever he sits he used this potty topped,  he has Two
__label__pos	my daughter loves Sophie too! 
__label__neu	I had high hopes for it--Munchkin products are usually high in quality.
__label__neu	Then I read the reviews and switched to this tub.  
__label__pos	I love looking at this swing  it's enchanting.
__label__pos	I have been using this brand since my daughter was 6 months old and have had no problems with any of the slow, medium, or fast flow nipples.
__label__pos	The other covers feel kind of scratchy and are definetly not as soft as this one.
__label__pos	Worth it
__label__neg	 Maybe later, when our baby is a bit older we'll pull out the Avent bottles again, but for now, we aren't using anything except Playtex VentAire
__label__pos	A necessity with a toddler!  
__label__pos	I am thoroughly pleased with this kit.
__label__neg	I ordered this one instead because it plugged into the wall.
__label__neu	Last night my daughter was 'picking' at the little colored dots on the pad.
__label__pos	"""I'm much more impressed with this gate than I was with the Summer Infant play yard."""
__label__neu	This is an Ikea cabinet so maybe the locks fit the modern design well. 
__label__neu	I eventually tought my son to whack it on the floor hard to turn the music on
__label__neg	The negatives: it takes a long time to pump even a small amount, it has a lot of parts. 
__label__neg	 Since I keep track of how much our baby eats, how can I do that when the liner is all scrunched up
__label__pos	this monitor does not make any distortion noises or anything of that sort.
__label__pos	It is unobtrusive and portable it grows with the child and -- contrary to what grandma thinks -- it seems to be perfectly comfortable for my child.
__label__neg	"I just think the design on the ""dangly parts"" could be better."
__label__pos	BUY IT!
__label__pos	"""Very colorful and textured so my son likes playing on it."""
__label__neg	I think I am going to return this for something a little better.
__label__pos	Overall a super product that I would recommend anyone purchase! 
__label__pos	Also this playyard is really big- huge!- which makes it way nicer for baby.
__label__neg	One of the inner flap's spring broke
__label__pos	I bought this for my 6 week old daughter because the price was nice and the table was attractive.
__label__pos	It's so much easier to carry than a traditional messenger style diaper bag, and IT LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CRAP YOUR WIFE CAN PUT IN IT!  
__label__pos	His antlers are great for teething.  
__label__pos	"""So I thought, heck, all these kids like it, why not give it a shot?"""
__label__pos	I charged the parent monitor overnight, installed lithium batteries in the baby monitor, and I was ready to go.
__label__neg	Besides all the leaks with this diaper, they are really stiff. 
__label__neg	I'd skip this one
__label__pos	 Baby Bjorn worked better
__label__neu	I was instructed by my pediatrician to boil all nursing items for 20 minutes due to my daughter having recurring Thrush.
__label__neu	I tried it every which way I could,  and no such luck.
__label__pos	It was cheap enough that I could actually do that!
__label__neu	Great idea, but bumper needs work.
__label__pos	My 18 month old and 3 year old love to play with it also. 
__label__pos	"""I highly recommend this swing to anyone looking to buy one, you will not be sorry."""
__label__pos	My favorite items are the nail clipper (which you can actually hold on to) the water temp (much easier to read than the one with the tub) and the brush (nice and soft).
__label__pos	This one is good because you can wash the cover, which I've had to do.
__label__neg	The receiver also seems to have trouble around our direct tv boxes. 
__label__pos	Good brush for little ones to carry around
__label__neu	I was worried that someday I would forget the electric pump at home and have to go a whole day without pumping.  
__label__neg	 Nothing could've been further from the truth
__label__neg	Secondly,  twist closing the lid is always a challenge
__label__pos	My son loves this bouncer.
__label__pos	"""It is great for us because the white noise keeps me up so i don't like to hear it through the monitor."""
__label__neu	I bought this in navy and then realized that everything else I have for baby is pastels
__label__pos	I think every parent should own one of these, it is inexpensive and well worth the money.
__label__pos	Worked great!
__label__neg	It does have bright colors but is not fun for him at all.
__label__neg	This thing is nothing to get excited about.
__label__neu	The colors of the actual articles are much more vibrant than shown in the pictures.
__label__neg	My son is 18 1/2 pounds and it's too small for him.
__label__neu	Built in teether. 
__label__neu	The worst part was the odor.
__label__pos	My daughter also loves the bright colors
__label__neg	The green suction bulb is so hard I can't possibly get it to compress with one hand - its useless for suctioning babies nose,  we used the one from the hospital
__label__pos	It actually SAVES my back from carrying my daughter a lot. 
__label__neg	 It is much cheaper & will definately work
__label__pos	"""My 21 month old son has had this album since he was seven months old, has played with it daily and it has survived in excellent condition."""
__label__neu	I can't believe they would come out with something this poor of quality.
__label__neu	If not, skip this item.
__label__pos	It's worth it.
__label__neu	I'm going to keep this stored in the closet to use with any more new babies we have.
__label__pos	It's supportive and comfortable for him
__label__pos	Absolutely GREAT!
__label__neu	Got this Graco IPO umbrella stroller for my 20 mo old baby. 
__label__neg	It has so many parts too clean and keep track of
__label__neg	 The sling was very helpful (the only reason this tub got 2 stars)when she wasn't able to sit up, but even then, she wasn't immersed in the water much
__label__neg	 Now this doesn't sound bad until you realize that the mechanism used to keep the smell in is very stiff and requires some pressure
__label__neu	Bath time became a pain.
__label__pos	"""Very easy to use and refill."""
__label__neu	You won't break your nails on these plugs because they come out fairly easily - you don't even need to push their little button
__label__neu	however the slightest leak and they seem to soak through easily not recommended for those who leak a lot
__label__pos	Buy it - you won't regret it!
__label__pos	I keep the parent monitor with me at all times, and I'm able to hear the smallest sounds from my elder's room.
__label__neg	This thing is junk and a waste of space. 
__label__neg	 The only good thing about this chair is the vibration, but definately not worth the $40.
__label__neu	The whole idea that I need to drill a big hole inside each cabinet door or drawer is a non starter.
__label__neu	baby monitor
__label__neg	"""The dye inside the foam does fade a bit when wiping it down with soap and water so I make sure it's absolutely dry from cleaning before I put my son on it."""
__label__neu	She falls asleep without any fussing.  
__label__pos	It does distribute the weight pretty well and is a welcome break to the shoulder fatigue sometimes caused by the Bjorn.
__label__pos	Plus, I've found it very easy to clean.
__label__pos	Much safer than the old blue seat or any seat with suction cups!
__label__neu	 To put it back in you have to completely unscrew the cap and put your fingers in
__label__pos	While the Born Free bottles have just as many parts to wash, you do not need a special small brush for these like you do with the Dr. Brown's bottles which I like.
__label__pos	This is a great swing and my daughter loves it.
__label__pos	 A shame, the docking station was a neat feature
__label__pos	A great bedding set all around.
__label__neu	But she would only sleep that long in this chair. 
__label__neu	Throw a Big Dot waterproof cover over this (see reviews for that, does double duty as a mattress pad too) and you're set.
__label__neu	These bottles are ok, but I like Dr. Brown's better.
__label__neu	This item is sadly going in the trash :(
__label__pos	What a wonderful buy.
__label__pos	:)
__label__neg	Then I would have to stop and take the pump apart to get the disk back in position.
__label__neg	 SCARY
__label__pos	It is incredibly soft and the pink with polka dots matches our room perfectly.
__label__neu	I use a small pad to help protect it
__label__pos	He's 30 lbs and still fits nicely in it it's still easy to clean and we use it every day.
__label__neg	I just don't think they described accurately what you are getting.
__label__neu	On several occasions,  my daughter ended up sliding down in between the side positioners.
__label__neu	One thing that I have learned is never to pick something beacause you like the pattern.
__label__pos	"I was initially concerned about previous reviews that these sheets would be ""too thin"" but I also purchased a quilted mattress pad/protector and they are great together."
__label__neu	my 2.
__label__neu	How often is there baseboarding on only one side of an opening?
__label__pos	Ultimately it's a fine product and I would recommend it.
__label__neg	She would get alot of gas when using these bottles
__label__pos	Great product--highly recommend it!
__label__neu	 I don't see how any average sized baby can fit in this for longer than that
__label__neu	The thing about this strap is that it uses the latch system on the car seat
__label__neg	We spent over $200 and it's all scratched and chipped
__label__neg	I bought these because my sister who had a baby a couple of months before me recommended them,  but I was very dissapointed
__label__neg	I first tried it when I had a clogged duct, and I found it too painful.
__label__neg	The cons.1)  Can't stand up to hard pulling by toddlers.
__label__neg	 This may work for much smaller babies, but at 8 lbs
__label__neg	Negative is that it is expensive.
__label__pos	My daughter is now 10-months-old and larger than average but I can still swaddle her with fabric to spare.
__label__pos	"""But the 3rd time was the charm!"""
__label__neg	In a tub full of ~100 degree water,  he consistently read 72-74 degrees
__label__neg	I used this diaper pail when I had my first daughter a couple of years ago and I did not like it at all
__label__neu	At the time,  the Sony Baby Call 27 channel had the best reviews out there.
__label__neg	And it doesn't just beep once - it beeps and beeps and beeps until you do something about it
__label__pos	Diaper Dekor has a step pedal,  so hands never have to go inside
__label__pos	I LOVE this as an unconventional bathtub!!
__label__neu	I also use this pillow for tummy time.
__label__neu	Over priced and poor quality if you ask me.
__label__neg	I am normally a side sleeper.
__label__pos	For what I have used it for it has been great and is very easy to use and clean.
__label__neu	She is very fidgety and therefore wakes herself up a lot if she is not in her swaddle me blankie.
__label__pos	I would really recommend this to other parents.
__label__neg	"""With each washing it got smaller and smaller and it made the contour of the pad malform a bit at the corners."""
__label__pos	It is generously sized but not overwhelmingly huge.It is made of a thin cotton, so isn't over hot to wear.
__label__neg	"""When we first used this toy (at night), my husband and I wondered if it was broken - that's how loud and grating the sound was."""
__label__neu	Maybe I did something wrong but when I called the company for help they weren't much help at all.
__label__pos	Well worth the money!
__label__pos	"""It looks super comfy for baby."""
__label__neg	My only critique is that the cover bends slightly after a while and as a result the cover can fall into the hamper if you're not careful.
__label__neg	 I'd stay away from it
__label__pos	 We loved it
__label__pos	It opens easily and closes in such a way that is easy for my husband and me but I know that our daughter won't be able to work it open.
__label__neu	 I heard a Woombie is good too
__label__neu	She stays under it talking and checking everything out and it's so much fun for me to lay next to it with her and watch her discover everything.  
__label__pos	Like so many other reviewers...my husband and I are SO thankful for this thing!
__label__neu	I really wanted it and was excited to use it.
__label__neg	 I have yet to fine one that will fit and still be a reasonable price
__label__neg	They are also very large and extremely noticeable - there is no way I would wear them in public. 
__label__neu	Expensive does not always equal good
__label__neg	I guess not EVERY product from a company is going to meet expectations. 
__label__neu	He still wakes up every 3 hours at night.
__label__pos	"""There is no volume control, but thankfully there is a mute button for when I need my son to look and not necessarily want to listen to it."""
__label__pos	And its overall best feature is how you can roll it from room to room without taking it apart.
__label__pos	This is a large baby tub, but it stores easily in the bathtub, cleans up very easily, and you will be able to use it for 2 years at least!
__label__pos	The remote to turn on and off the mobile seems like a nice convenience, but I haven't used it except to test it.
__label__pos	I can count on at least an hour or 2 of 'me' time when shes sleeping in it.
__label__pos	The swing always makes him sleepy so it is great to calm him and even to make him sleepy.
__label__neu	The wipes at the top when the dispenser was full really weren't all that warm.
__label__neg	 He is 2 1/2 months old right now and when we first used it he didn't like it because he wasn't in the water
__label__neg	 It is horrible
__label__neg	Just super dissapointed with these monitors - ABSOLUTELY NOT worth its big price tag
__label__pos	They are cute and are somewhat entertaining to my son,  so that is why it has two stars and not one
__label__neu	We recently bought this pad for our changing table in the blue color. 
__label__pos	"""I replaced the older version with this one because of the music and mobile."""
__label__pos	I bought this set hoping that despite the low price it would work based on the reviews on this site.
__label__pos	And it does a great job with maintaining milk supply. 
__label__pos	Between playing with all the toys and smiling/talking to himslef in the mirror, I could once again take a shower that lastest more than 2 minute, and even put on some make-up and brush my hair.
__label__pos	I would recommend this.
__label__neg	Each wrap session takes like 5 minutes and if it becomes loose or undone you have to unwrap to rewrap it with both hands (and the baby might fall out while you're doing this).
__label__neg	 Using twisties to seal the bags is cumbersome and annoying
__label__pos	Plenty of room for my little guy to play around with his rubber ducky and splash a bit
__label__pos	I am buying more because over time you loose a few here and a few there.
__label__neg	The other thing I had trouble with was the plastic ring that came with the kit; I just used a bowl.
__label__neu	It was very easy to put together and has a multitude of adjustments in the seat and footrest to grow with baby it is very durable seemingly knick proof easy to clean there are a few nooks and crannies which get a little crumb traffic but easy to get with a vacuum hose.
__label__neu	But even if you aren't successful... who cares?
__label__neg	If you have these, they will work, but I much prefer the Lansinoh pads.
__label__neg	 At least it was neutral which was what I wanted
__label__neu	But since the purpose of them is to be in seperate rooms it shouldn't really matter to much.
__label__neu	When you do get that figured out then you get to deal with the stupid sling.
__label__pos	Babies love it!
__label__pos	I loved it because I didn't worry about her getting her blanket loose and then getting it over her face.
__label__pos	"""It isn't even close."""
__label__neg	Buyer beware
__label__neg	 But, it still leaks
__label__neg	My advice on this item is,  don't buy it,  even if it does work,  you will probably never use it
__label__neg	 Brown's bottles and could not get used to this classic bottle
__label__neg	 We have washed it a few times and the edge is fraying and coming off
__label__neg	but, I don't know why they would create a book that is obviously for a baby but allow for a possible choking hazard
__label__neu	That is how I decided on the Baby Einstein.  
__label__neg	 We learned our lesson the hard way
__label__neg	*so disappointed.
__label__pos	still using it to help her sleep at nights now.
__label__neg	They are the only company that will completely ignore emails, phone calls, etc.
__label__neu	so it made my son gag & spit up every few sucks, and his feedings that should've taken 10 min would literally take 30...
__label__neg	I assume the baby's body muffles the sound, since no one else noted this in their review.
__label__neu	"""My daughter loves to be held and carried, as long as she is awake, she wants to be in someone's arms, needless to say I needed a break."""
__label__neg	The one big problem is the temperature sensitive plug.
__label__neg	The battery only lasts about 5 hours off the charging base so I can't make it through the whole night without it beeping due to low battery
__label__pos	Ok so the idea of the Diaper Champ is awesome-- it is very easy to use-- that's why I gave it 1 star.
__label__pos	The release mechanism does take more strength and dexterity than a toddler has3)  Very flexible.
__label__pos	They hold enough liquid and they are easy to handle for both of us.  
__label__neg	The seller of this product is wonderful,  but the Maya Wrap is not for me or my little guy
__label__pos	"""I highly recommend it!!"""
__label__neg	Save your money, don't buy this product!
__label__pos	My daughter had no problem sitting with the little guard on the front.
__label__pos	"""It held up just fine in the washer."""
__label__pos	Highly recommended!!
__label__pos	We have been using it for our baby anyway, and she does seem to like the added scoopability with this plate, as it is a bit easier to grab things from the rounded compartments. 
__label__neg	I also wonder if the system it uses to attach to the side of the chair is a wee bit too flimsy.
__label__pos	our dog loved his treat!
__label__neg	When I saw that the refills cost about $20.00 for 3 bags I thought oh my gosh.
__label__pos	I started bouncing pupsqueak and he started squeaking and my son started laughing in delight.  
__label__neu	Needless to say,  I'd steer clear of this one.
__label__pos	I can easily bathe her alone without problems.
__label__neu	Also this seems to be molded more for short people.
__label__pos	:)  I still love my duel electric for work just for ease of use but love this little guy for the occasional home use.
__label__pos	Also, it seems like when you are on the lowest levels the swing is hardly moving.
__label__neg	We unfortunately bought this before reading the reviews.
__label__neg	My son (now 9 months old) likes this toy - somewhat
__label__neu	I had to use the Original style instead). 
__label__neu	Just lifted it and took it downstairs! 
__label__pos	The handles are perfect for her little hands to grab and the sippy nipple is soft enough for her to use.
__label__neu	once i pulled it out to be longer but,  no matter how much i struggled to put the extension back together,  it just wouldn't click.
__label__neu	They tell you not to do this
__label__neg	The pictures look like a five year old drew them and are somewhat scary.
__label__neg	 The sling is uncomfortably narrow at the shoulder & doesn't distribute weight well
__label__neu	Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube
__label__neu	I have no idea really. 
__label__neg	 Because of this, it tends to cause a downhill slope, and baby slides down
__label__neu	The Diaper Genie's only redeeming quality is the fact that it closes at the top.
__label__pos	"""It is half the price of the Baby Bjorn and it is so conveniant."""
__label__neg	 Well, out of all of the items I have purchased these two were the BIGGEST waste of money and are more of an inconvenience than anything. 
__label__neu	!
__label__neu	I could not get this mirror to stay put in my car.
__label__neu	Cons.
__label__neu	I followed directions and thought I had it right, mabye they should send out someone to show me how it works. 
__label__neu	This sheet is still soft,  still fits the mattress (I've been drying it on my regular settings in my dryer for the last year,  at least,  without any shrinkage)
__label__pos	"""The soft plush, the bright colors, that cute bark, the squeak, the rattle, those crinkly ears--what's not to love?"""
__label__neg	I would actually give this fewer stars because we've gotten NO use out of it
__label__neg	Because if you breastfeed your baby, the diapers really DON'T stink that much!
__label__neu	This has two for the bottles and two for the Via nursers.
__label__pos	"""Its sturdy and has plenty of space to place items."""
__label__neg	Impossible for a baby,  even young toddler to turn it on
__label__pos	Highly recommend.
__label__neg	 But she is just not interested
__label__neu	They slide out easily and never seem to get stuck in the netting.
__label__pos	I want even aware that you could, but I loved being able to see my angel and hug him all the time.
__label__pos	If you are looking for something for a young infant that is still exploring.
__label__neu	If you clean them out right away you have less of a problem.
__label__neu	Does it have all of the bells and whistles the Bugaboo does?
__label__pos	It entertains him long enough for me to get a shower, dress and dry my hair.
__label__pos	The only advantage I can see to these bags is that they are easy to hook to the medella breast pump and pump into directly.
__label__neu	Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).
__label__pos	But it's well made and once in a while she will gnaw on it for a bit.
__label__neu	"""When my son was 3 month old, his neck was a lot stronger."""
__label__neu	The lights flash when the music plays.  
__label__neu	Even taking it from room to room requires some manipulation to fit through the doorways.  
__label__pos	I now own 4 and it's not enough. 
__label__pos	"They dont ""leak"" out the goodies so easily or the crumbs.  "
__label__neu	but I think it's one of those personal preference things
__label__pos	Overall the swing is cute and my baby liked it for a while but he only used for 1 month tops and he much prefers the full size swing.
__label__pos	really glad we got it.
__label__neu	It was uncomfortable and hard to roll from side-to-side with.
__label__pos	Highly reccomended
__label__neg	 I tried it on my faucet without a shower stopper and it fell off several times but because it was already out of the box I opted to try it out for the bathtime
__label__neu	The odor protection of the Diaper Champ really leaves something to be desired.
__label__neu	It kept him warm (sometimes too warm) and was easy to get him in and out of.
__label__neg	I bought this diaper because of the good reviews however I found that it does nothing to keep out odors.
__label__pos	"""The large shape is, I think, helping him learn how to grasp better."""
__label__neg	If you are refilling and take the top off with the straw still in and then replace, liquid will come shooting out the straw.
__label__pos	GREAT MONITOR @ Great price
__label__neu	beware,  as your child ages,  this system does not hide the odors.
__label__neg	 I was registered for the baby bjorn
__label__neg	The motor on this toy is SO loud
__label__neu	"After having 3 Maclaren strollers (techno, triumph and rally twin), I can say: cons are that this stroller is smaller and heavier, narrower than the maclaren, the sunshade is not that good b/c it doesn't cover all that much, the seatback is short (my son's head bulges out the fabric when he lays down) not an issue on the maclaren, the foam handles are kinda rough, the locking latch is manually done, not automatic like the Mac does, and I have to try not kick the back of the wheels with my long stride (although I am only 5' 4"" and never an issue on the Mac).... "
__label__pos	Life Saver
__label__neg	"Oh, and forget about ""quick"" middle-of-the-night diaper changes--it's nearly impossible to get his legs out of the bottom pouch, so wrestling him out of the blanket wakes him up."
__label__pos	One of the advantages for me these are so much easier to clean than the others.
__label__pos	There's no shrinking, fading or unraveling and the zippers still work perfectly.
__label__neu	Who knows.
__label__neu	this is the worst bath tub i've bought.
__label__neg	When I first put her in it at about 2 weeks old, she didn't like it.
__label__neu	When you play catch; it does make clicking sound.
__label__neg	"""The only con I would say is that the handles are pointless, and I never used the hood."""
__label__neg	No luck.
__label__neg	 Since it was a gift I decided to keep it
__label__neg	 So did the toys left in it overnight
__label__neg	 It's a total pain to empty and change the bags
__label__pos	I would highly suggest using this one from the very beginning.
__label__pos	The pattern is soothing and classy, with muted blues and yellows.
__label__neg	Avent bottles are not as great as all the write ups
__label__pos	"""It's a great seat- I highly recommend it!"""
__label__pos	*Update*I had to update this posting because this toy has become a big hit in the last few months
__label__neu	He was plaing in the play pen wiggling his legs against the walls of the play pen
__label__neg	Well that's great and all but didn't the FDA approve baby formula and other such items that were found to contain melamine?! 
__label__pos	I like the angle of the bottle.
__label__neu	There are many other sizes available at the woombie website. 
__label__pos	We love this gate!
__label__neg	 His arms were forced upward, looking like a bird trying to fly
__label__neg	It didn't fit together right and then the adhesive didn't stick to the brick
__label__neg	 Would recommend using a sling with an infant.
__label__neu	So we just took it up and she's been fine without anything on it
__label__pos	"""The Synergy is great because its breathable so we can use it during the summer."""
__label__neg	The sling slips out of place all the time and the bath ring isn't worth the extra work it takes to clean it and the little ridges that hold it into the tub. 
__label__neg	"""I wish there was a size medium, which would be perfect."""
__label__neg	"""You have to use your foot or hand to jog the seat back and forth to calm the baby or to keep the baby entertained."""
__label__neu	Before I got this organizer,   I used a tall rectangular snapware container with a lid; it held more bags and took less space in my freezer.
__label__pos	"""They are versatile for all weather temps too as can be layered over warmer jammies, onsies, etc...."""
__label__pos	It is a great way to get more use out of those bottles.I noticed that there are extra parts available for this pump.
__label__neu	"""It was so big and bulky that I only used it once and it was trying it on!"""
__label__neg	 The more I pumped the less milk I got out
__label__neu	So I tried to get the smear off with window cleaner, and that made the whole mirror worse, so now it's all foggy!
__label__neg	 My son doesn't like that he get's his hand stuck in there between the wedges (and he's 1), and then trying to get it out, he dumps cheerios all over
__label__neu	I don't think every newborn likes to be swaddled
__label__neu	Be sure to try at home first!
__label__neg	 Then I tried not putting the bundle me over the impact wings but that left a lot of extra fabric where the baby's head would be, which I thought was a suffocation hazard
__label__neu	I keep one in my bedroom and one in another part of the house.  
__label__pos	Safer than Britax, Graco, First Years, Combi, etc.  
__label__pos	"""This product gets the job done."""
__label__neu	"Only their ""Polypropylene Line"" of bottles are BPA Free.  "
__label__pos	It is wonderful. 
__label__neg	I think it was a waste of money
__label__pos	This cup is great,  my 6 mos old used it all on her own very well,  better than the others we've tried but we lost the internal straw after a week.
__label__neu	Cute concept just for my son he didn't find them interesting
__label__pos	"""I tried 2 other tubs before I got this one."""
__label__neu	 Also, it took quite some time before my son was able to face forward
__label__neu	As the caregiver for an elder who's recovering from stroke, I need to monitor her condition constantly -- a difficult task when you're also taking care of additional household responsibilities.
__label__neu	Able to see well at night too.
__label__neg	the package blatantly lies in saying that it fits elongated seats - it will fit,  but it'll also slide around and leave large gaps
__label__neg	This was not safe.
__label__neg	"""Save space by getting a little bigger tub that will spend more time holding your splashing baby than sitting under your sink: I have the Newborn to Toddler Tub by The First Years--my baby is a year old and I still use it (she is petite, but I'm sure anyone can get at least 6-9 months out of it.)"""
__label__pos	I put them on her feet and she loves them.
__label__neu	It kept flipping up and covering her face while she slept.
__label__neg	"""It is very big compared to the other tubs out there, but we just store it in our bathtub when it's not in use."""
__label__neg	I have tried little tricks to make sure it remains aligned after I screw it shut, but the alignment always shifts and then the cup leaks. 
__label__pos	Our faucet extends far enough that the tub water can be continuously refreshed.
__label__pos	"""A great toy!"""
__label__pos	"""We also keep at least one in the car for him to play with in his carseat."""
__label__pos	its very good quality!
__label__neg	"""I would say, buy anything else but this."""
__label__neg	 Boy am I sorry
__label__neu	When my 5- month- old started teething my father- in- law tried to put crushed ice in a Zip- loc bag so she'd have something to chomp on (she wasn't a fan of chilled teethers).
__label__pos	I actually liked this swaddle quite a bit.
__label__neu	Being a sleep-deprived first time mother, I was not sure she would even need such an item.
__label__neg	Very frustrating
__label__neu	He LOVES the Gerber Transition cup (7oz...not the other Gerber cup.) and he's okay w/ the Avent cup.
__label__neg	Within less than 1 week, the mirror fogged up. 
__label__neg	At $159 the motor should not go out
__label__neu	The top surface is nice,  but the bottom needs more slide resistance.
__label__neu	My Little one will stay in the sling for hours when out although he can get tired and fussy in the stroller
__label__neg	 Then, they fit, but the fabric would stretch out during the night and she'd get her arms up and wake herself up
__label__neu	What else could you ask for?
__label__neu	UPDATE:My daughter is now 5 years old.
__label__neu	I have tried numerous baby spoons.
__label__neg	The gate does not swing back, does not close by itself and only the bottom lock works
__label__neg	The beep is so loud and annoying and it's allllll night long. 
__label__pos	This is a good sheet.
__label__neg	I would get about a total of 4-5oz after 30-45 min. 
__label__neu	It doesn't cut through the bags,  you have to use scissors to do it.
__label__pos	Thanks for making this tub
__label__pos	An excellent purchase! 
__label__neg	As for the starter kit, it's odd that this is the only time you can get the flat lids that fit the bottle (for freezing or refrigerating without the nipple on).
__label__neg	That said, I have one major complaint with this bouncer...
__label__neu	"""the second she starts trying to pull it off, i remove it."""
__label__pos	"""This blanket is perfect for swaddling (it keeps the swaddle tight, very important!)"""
__label__pos	We can plop him into the seat and his attention span is absorbed for up to a couple hours.
__label__neu	Go for the white!  
__label__neg	If I didn't already have a pretty good idea about the water temp,  I could have really scalded my kids
__label__neg	"""3)  As a whole, the toy panel is a bit of a disappointment - if I could find a similar playzone without the built-in toys, and pay less for it, I wouldn't miss the toy panel for a second (nor would my kids)."""
__label__neg	No matter how many times I twist after the first diaper, the second one always pushes right through the first twist and ends up hanging in the bottom - un-sausage-linked.
__label__pos	It was an instant hit!
__label__neu	We ended up having to rewet ours almost every day.
__label__neu	I got this gate since it is made for the top of the stairs and was wide enough for our staircase. 
__label__pos	Great Tub
__label__neg	I wish that there were another option in a lighter color and a lightweight fabric for summer.
__label__pos	"""We honestly should have bought these in the first place."""
__label__neu	, 2004 Tried to use it,  threw it out.
__label__pos	"""Everyone who saw me using it loved it too!"""
__label__pos	It is nice that it is small and portable but it is really tiny when you get it on a toilet.  
__label__neu	Best for small spaces, travel to family and in hotels, and roomier and appears safer than bassinet. 
__label__neu	My son enjoys it as much as a 3.
__label__neg	Now the mirror is foggy, scratchy, and totally unuseable. 
__label__neu	Only two (seldom used) cabinets are still working. 
__label__pos	Also you can switch it to blue/no timer,  green,  red,  and rainbow.
__label__pos	One plus for me, though it is a small feature is the little storage compartment in the base, I throw a few diapers in there, just in case!  
__label__pos	We got these Kidco Lock Set and it was so easy to stick on and now she's locked out for sure
__label__neg	Do not waste your money!
__label__neu	He's 99th percentile in length. 
__label__pos	We registered online for this bag because we thought it was stylish. 
__label__neg	In additon to this the cost is ridiculous.
__label__pos	It easy clips and velcro's so you can adjust it in any car.
__label__neu	Thank goodness I always held on to her.
__label__pos	"""I suggest bringing it to the hospital."""
__label__neg	You'll have to read more of my reviews about OTHER toys to see what disappointed me.
__label__pos	This is one of the few balls that's safe to throw in the house and a younger toddler and his older sister can have fun sharing.
__label__pos	I really like this bottle warmer.
__label__pos	He absolutely loves being in the swing.  
__label__neg	"""The only con is that you have to untie it every single time you want to fold the stroller..."""
__label__pos	we've been very happy with the Diaper Dekor and recommend that
__label__neg	Too heavy to lug around in diaper bag
__label__pos	"""plus it's not as thick as this one."""
__label__neg	 It provides zero warmth and barely acts as a barrier between the cold and your baby
__label__neg	The other one worked great but the bar at the bottom of this one warped in the sun within the first week.
__label__pos	This product is fabulous!
__label__neu	"""FOLLOW UP 6ISH MONTHS LATER: Bag has been awesome, big, stylish, and very functional, but I must have overloaded it and blown out the fabric."""
__label__pos	he enjoys feeling like hes taking a bath even though the water level doesn't come past the point of the mat.
__label__pos	Baby loves to play with it.
__label__neg	I bought it yesterday, and I'm returning it tomorrow.
__label__neu	"""First, to all the parents who are sucking on the bottle to 'get it started' for your babies - STOP."""
__label__neg	 I'm ordering another Twistaway and giving this model to Goodwill
__label__neg	this thing is the worst piece of junk i've ever ordered
__label__neu	If you don't order the four pack of locks you must order the key separately!
__label__pos	Excellent for a multitude of uses
__label__pos	"""This is an awesome carrier if you have a newborn or a child that is already used to facing inwards."""
__label__pos	It puts him to sleep when mommy has something to get done, he will look at himself in the mirror, he loves the music, and he watches his Baby Einstein videos while in it.
__label__neg	I have tried five different types of bottles and these are horrible.
__label__neu	Saves the mess and saves the food.
__label__neu	Maybe some are leaky,  some are not.
__label__pos	They are the most clear and most visible.
__label__pos	These bottles are great because my son had such bad colic he was screaming when he would eat.
__label__neg	 Our monitor seems to be very fuzzy; it picks up lots of white noise. 
__label__neg	Used this once and gave it away
__label__pos	"""It's worth every penny!"""
__label__neg	I guarantee they will break off with little effort.
__label__neu	 I prefer the regular body pillows and find much more comfort using them-for a lot less money
__label__neu	I'm holding out hope that she will figure out the straw- like opening this sippy sports which is supposed to be the best kind for developing jaws and such.
__label__pos	I know the swing is only meant for occasional use but every couple of hours for a week did it no damage.
__label__neu	Explore the outdoors......
__label__neu	The Snuzzler is reversable for summer or winter and is adjustable as the baby grows.
__label__pos	After that, I cut the hook off and now it's perfect!  
__label__neg	"""As a petite woman, it is difficult to lift the baby entirely over my head so that I can slide him inside the infant insert..."""
__label__pos	Despite the lack of availability of the refills I would buy this product again.  
__label__neg	It doesn't do anything.
__label__pos	"""It also has the best changing pad with pockets where you can stick wipes."""
__label__pos	"""He gets a great vantage point plust it gives him the nice rocking motion they love."""
__label__neu	It is definitely a little boy's bedding set.  
__label__neg	"""My son just turned six months old and we just put away the swing, not because of weight but because he is to much of a big boy to be in a swing (according to him)."""
__label__neg	But it's definitely below average IMHO.  
__label__pos	Soft and cozy
__label__neg	The seat, unfortunately, catches all the pee on the underside, causing the toilet seat to be pee covered, the potty seat underside to be pee covered, and the seat to leak out pee once you pick the thing up. 
__label__neg	Someone talked about this item not being sturdy
__label__neg	 And sometimes it's almost impossible to unlock it to take it down, and you just have to pull it out from the doorway. 
__label__pos	The old style are good too Good to know before buying.
__label__pos	I also have two at Grandma's for changing and laying on the bed.
__label__neg	They helped with gas yet were not a pain to clean (like the Dr. Brown's bottles.
__label__neg	This thing does not stick to car windows and even if I made it stick,  it would fall down before we even got out of the garage
__label__neg	" It hurt his bottom so badly that he cried & said ""oh mommy my legs"
__label__neg	Then I got tired of changing clothes from all the leaks I experienced.
__label__pos	I highly recommend this for anyone with a tile bathroom, (with a corner) who has a need for storage of many many bath toys!!  
__label__neg	HOWEVER the zipper on our case broke after two uses (we never forced the bed into the case).  
__label__pos	Emersyn plays with it alot and loves the lights that change and create a Kaleidoscope of colors that both fascinate her and cause er to chatter!
__label__pos	I've tried generic immitations and they just don't compare.
__label__pos	I had originally chosen another bedding set because it looked so cute on-line.
__label__neu	I bought these for my daughter because she found her feet, and I figured since she was always playing with them I would get her something to put on her feet to play with.
__label__pos	Highly recommended A+
__label__neu	When he does this the arch comes off the car seat and it has already it him twice on the head.
__label__neu	I have your average, fiberglass shower/tub, and this thing is FILLED with bath toys. 
__label__pos	This product looked so beautiful online.
__label__pos	My son has always been a big chubby baby but we still use the tray on the middle of the three settings so I'm not worried that he will feel constricted as he grows bigger.
__label__neu	Very confusing - but these here are not the BPA Free Bottles!!
__label__neg	This may sound pathetic, but after buying this product I find myself too lazy to use it.
__label__neu	I have used everything in this little kit so far except for the dropper.
__label__neu	After reading all the positive reviews I'm going to try this again so may update my review again now that he's bigger.
__label__neu	It does make some noise when your baby jumps but nothing unbearable.
__label__neu	it worked well for us and had her close without being in my bed ( not wanting to break that habit later of sleeping with us plus she was only 6 pounds at birth). 
__label__neg	I wish we had saved our money.
__label__neg	I bought these yesterday at babie r us and am now signed in looking for a better option
__label__neg	They are a great product if your child takes to the trainer set other wise inquisitive children get distracted by them specially because of the color choices instead of making them clear or white.
__label__neu	I bought this stroller when our son was 1 month old and used it not even for 5 months and also occasionally.
__label__neu	I would recommend buying one set from Target ( or some grocery stores cary Avent) and trying first.
__label__neg	 It took me 45 minutes of frustration and power tools before I gave up and let my husband finish it
__label__neu	I added buttons and loops couple of inches above the zipper ends it took just few minutes but helps a lot when it's cold and windy - just a suggestion maybe someone else would find it useful too.
__label__pos	It's nice to be able to provide a little extra comfort.I use pampers sensitive pop-up wipes, and sometimes two pop out instead of one, but it's really no problem...how many times do you use just one wipe anyway?
__label__neg	Another viewer was right about the lack of slits to pull the straps through to hold the baby. 
__label__pos	Definitely recommend.
__label__pos	I just had my second baby and am still using my original Isis breast pump that I used with my first child four years ago.
__label__neg	Also, the remote didn't come even close to fitting on my visor.
__label__pos	Later edit: We've now had this smock for about 2 years and it's barely showing signs of wear.
__label__neu	My son was a very light sleeper and any little noise would wake him up. 
__label__neg	It was the most expensive on the shelf but she will only be little once.
__label__neu	"""I wanted to try it, again."""
__label__neu	"""Of course, I did get mine used so this could be due to that??"""
__label__neu	I've been much happier with the Avent cups that have replacement mouthpieces widely available.
__label__pos	Get it,  get it,  get it
__label__neu	And I didnt realize until much later that it played music. 
__label__neu	FYI!!  
__label__neu	So far it's not too much of a problem. 
__label__neu	I've never had back problems, so that's not the issue. 
__label__neu	The model I purchased is the J5933 but there is another model L1907.
__label__neg	She was 3 months old when we tried it.
__label__pos	I'll probably toss a throw on her when it gets colder, but for a primary comforter it's perfect.
__label__neu	if only all our items would have been so durable. 
__label__neu	All in all,  a major dissapointment.
__label__neg	It still doesn't work
__label__neu	The color in the picture is not a good representation of the ACTUAL color.
__label__neu	Seeing that others have had problems with these not sticking, I figured that they couldn't be manufactured that poorly and that others were maybe not cleaning the rail well enough before applying. 
__label__neg	 Let's just say we're very unhappy because you don't just spend a lot on the original purchase, you spend a huge amount on replacement nipples
__label__neu	I would recommend using the 2nd level for babies that are very active, this way they learn cause and effect.
__label__neg	 There isn't anything fundamentally wrong with the swing; it is what it is
__label__neg	Cute looking but not very useful
__label__pos	The velcro stays put and she stays inside tight and neat like a baby burrito and falls RIGHT to sleep in minutes - if she's really tired, SECONDS!  
__label__pos	We've used this for about four months now and it makes bathing our baby so simple.
__label__neu	*~
__label__pos	She loves looking at the animals and at herself in the mirror
__label__neg	This is a great stroller for 1 child but not for 2It was impossible for my 2 year old to sit or stand in the back with my 1 month old riding in the front which I thought was the entire point of this strollerIt is only a good buy if both of your children are old enough to ride in the seats only the infant carrier part is completely useless
__label__pos	"""I received this for my baby room at my shower, I love it so much."""
__label__neg	 I switched to the Sure Comfort newborn to toddler tub and he likes it so much better
__label__pos	But they last such a long time that it is very worth it!
__label__neu	I suggest always drying out the tub/sling after each bath by squeezing out excess water from the pillow and turning tub over to air dry.
__label__neu	This is a love/hate relationshipLoveThat they work so well with bottle accessories and cups stuff later on
__label__neu	A lot
__label__neu	So I tried Gerber for newborns
__label__neu	It leaked the first time we used it because I didn't snap the locks into place all the way.
__label__neg	The other minor drawback is that the seat does not come up all the way.
__label__neg	This way I just change the multi-use pad and I don't have to wash the changing pad cover very often.
__label__pos	It is nice to know you aren't putting unnecessary chemicals in your baby's body.
__label__neu	I put tissue at the bottom just in case and it does the job just fine
__label__pos	"""She can sleep in too!!!"""
__label__neg	If you place it in water the bottom collects it, only to pour out when it is inverted.
__label__neu	Video only works if you sit there and watch it (which defeats the purpose of freeing you up for chores),  and if it has audio,  as this one does,  then why even HAVE video?? Video is an unnecessary expense,  because just what is there to SEE inside a baby's crib anyway?
__label__neu	"""Also, quick side note."""
__label__pos	She likes to grab it and play with it for long times.
__label__pos	sometimes target just has random items for super cheap prices
__label__pos	I think the main thing it did was to give my son the confidence to use a potty - his feet stayed securely on the ground and it was stable and didn't slip around.
__label__neg	Also the nipple collapes ALL THE TIME. 
__label__pos	We loved the Advent bottles but they didn't help with his gas problem.
__label__neg	When I called the company(which has the worst hours), they just sent me a bag of parts and said you figure it out. 
__label__pos	He liked it.
__label__neg	 a waste i think, most bottles have 2 fast or slow but there seemed to be 4 different sizes or more
__label__neu	 Go with the Dr
__label__pos	I highly recommend this.
__label__pos	Perhaps these products work fine with a typical changing table,  but keep in mind they do not work with a folding top dresser type.
__label__neg	"""If I could wish for anything..."""
__label__neu	Bulk pack came with several foam inserts to put behind plates on drafty walls.
__label__pos	However, I found an even better use!
__label__pos	My foster son has terrible reflux, and these bottles have made a definite improvement for him.
__label__neg	" When it arrived (with included batteries in a ""try me"" box), the batteries were dead"
__label__pos	It is a pretty good buy.
__label__neg	 My daughter dislikes using them and I can't get her to nurse with these
__label__pos	Great quality, very comfortable.
__label__neu	I love this travel swing for serving it's purpose but as far as it's portability that left me with some gripes.
__label__pos	But so far so good!!
__label__neu	Wiping the Genie out with disinfecting wipes and spraying with Lysol helps a little.
__label__neu	You really do need to screw the tops on correctly.
__label__pos	The controls are easy to use.  
__label__neu	I thought that was sleazy.
__label__neu	I thought this product would help with that but it doesn't.
__label__pos	Easy to install, easy to operate.
__label__neu	The plastic side buckles to hold the child in place were not that secure,  so when we used it we still held her for fear of them opening up - defeats the purpose of having your hands free!
__label__pos	When I got home and took it out of the package, I realized that the seams weren't sewn very well at the top and stuffing was starting to poke out of the seams!I went back and exchanged it for the plain bopppy & this luxe slipcover... Am I happy I did!!!
__label__neg	These are soft and I prefer the jersey version of these pads (the fleece version tended to leave lint on my skin if it wasn't completely dry--yuck for baby!
__label__neg	I waited a really long time to buy this because it felt like a lot of money to pay for a smock.
__label__pos	When people think of slings they think of ring slings and this Maya Lightly Padded should win the prize for best workhorse sling.
__label__pos	Our baby passed out in it for hours in her first few weeks.
__label__neg	I have noticed that if I move the camera to certain areas of the crib the reception will suffer so you have to get the camera in just the right spot.
__label__neu	I bought this because I wanted a carrier for short trips instead of always hauling a stroller.
__label__neg	Even when she was just a few days old,  she was strong enough to wiggle out
__label__neg	However,  the toys are not easy to get on and a few fall off often but can be put back on
__label__neg	They last with repeated use for several months then ours eventually develop a crack in them from being thrown on the floor.
__label__neg	 In order to have it reclined correctly, we had to remove the base, use 3 pool noodles AND a blanket
__label__neg	The babysitter discovered that she preferred rubber nipples over silicon ones because they are softer, but she didn't like the shape of other brands, so it was still a struggle to try to get her to drink from a bottle during the day. 
__label__neu	"""I brought this because of the great reviews this product got."""
__label__pos	It is also important to note that the Snuzzler meets all official flammability requirements.
__label__neu	Choose a store that has various models on display. 
__label__pos	well made, comes with a remote.
__label__pos	But now she is 9lb 10oz and is just right for the swing - not to fast.
__label__neg	For this product to really work well, the bags need to be much thicker so that the diaper smell is blocked NOT masked
__label__neg	 Even with cleaning them often using alcohol, as the manual suggests, they fall off every single day
__label__neu	Then i bought electrical one. 
__label__neu	We have that in the kitchen and the Papasan in the livingroom.
__label__neu	I would return them but I washed them before putting them on.
__label__neu	I don't have much experience with pacifiers to judge. 
__label__pos	I have the jungle style for my little girl (basically the same thing but different scheme) she loved it from day one played until we finally took her out (normally half hour is her max with anything) but she loved this a lot so much to do.
__label__pos	"""She loved having snack in the little snack tray and all her little friends that came to play always ran to the table..."""
__label__neg	Absolutely the worst
__label__pos	I ended up getting the Medela Pump In Style and loved it
__label__neu	Would not recommed to anyone.
__label__pos	I like the wide neck bottles because they are closer to breast feeding and when my son got older, it was easier for him to hold the bottle on his own.
__label__neu	They left my baby bloody more than once and they're going in the trash tonight.
__label__neu	If she pulls them in,  she can still walk in it down the hall to our room
__label__neu	So it leaves 2 gaps because the pieces don't come together completely.
__label__pos	The Munchkin formula dispenser was a great buy for sure!
__label__neu	I had one heck of a time assembling it.  
__label__pos	However,  the fabric is soft.
__label__neu	It's very obvious when one is soaked as it weight a whole lot more and feels like a dead jellyfish,  but you only know this when you check it
__label__pos	It can be assembled very quickly.
__label__neg	He also hated the sling that came with it.
__label__neg	 If only they would have a non-toxic (no BPA, pthalates etc) version of this same design!
__label__neg	But she just got fussier and fussier because she was spitting up everything at each feeding.
__label__pos	I love this product.
__label__neu	We ended up purchasing the Leap Frog Learning Seat which is really neat and has age appropriate stimulation.
__label__neg	I reported this already to consumer safety unfortunately Combi the manufacturer does not give you the option to write an email but just to call - and only between certain hours SMILEY which makes it kind of hard to reach them.
__label__pos	It is a very stylish, sturdy carrier that couldn't be easier to use.  
__label__pos	But it sits great in the tub and doesn't slide around
__label__neu	Look through the reviews and you can see many people upset about these leaking.
__label__neg	This is not what you want.  
__label__pos	"""This is a must-have for working mothers."""
__label__pos	My kiddo goes everywhere in his carseat and loves it.
__label__neu	"""It will take some practice for her to scoot all the way back on it."""
__label__neg	"""Oh well."""
__label__neu	I just turn it upside down and empty it out.
__label__neu	It broke in 3 different parts within the first week. 
__label__neg	 Video only works if you watch it, and if it has audio, as this one does, then why even HAVE video
__label__neu	I bought this Floppy Seat when my son outgrew his Snugride carrier at 6-7 months
__label__pos	They work great
__label__pos	 I never used covers with DD and never had a problem.
__label__pos	The songs it plays actually are a good distraction although I haven't needed to distract him because it's not unpleasant to suction his nose anymore!
__label__pos	CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT!!!
__label__neg	"pros - easy to clean- works like a straw as you only have to suck to get the air out and as soon as the air comes out the milk comes up so the bottle works at every angleCONS -The liners break when you try to ""burp"" them to get all the air out"
__label__pos	MY 15 MONTHS AGE DAUGHTER PLAYS WITH IT.
__label__neg	 Bottle feeding is not rocket science and no mother should have to pay that much to feed her child successfully
__label__neg	Since I have read about this problem in other reviews,  I do not believe its a fluke
__label__neg	 Sure, there is one less piece to the straw, but you have to dismantle the flip top to get the straw apart (ultimately resulting in the same number of parts)
__label__pos	"""I think the sleep sacks are wonderful!"""
__label__pos	Super soft fabric.
__label__neu	They may work well in holding in liquid, but gee, that's what polyester DOES. 
__label__neu	Comparison with regular Gerber premiums
__label__neg	 They are cute, but they leak and make a terrible mess
__label__neu	Honestly,  my husband and I use the plastic bags that the daily newspaper comes in
__label__neg	"""They're junk."""
__label__pos	"""After reading all of the reviews I purchased this bouncer."""
__label__pos	This playyard has a really thick high- quality floor that is comfortable and baby could sleep on.
__label__pos	"""She hasn't had a problem sliding down at all and even though I'm a worried first time mom, I put her to sleep on it while she's in her bassinet."""
__label__pos	My daughter loves this.  
__label__neg	 The splash guard is what really seems to make it uncomfortable for her
__label__pos	We have now just unplugged the thing and use it as an attractive wipes holder!
__label__pos	It does the job well - holds bottles,  cups,  toys,  snack trap,  etc
__label__neg	"""Plus, Houston is very hot, wearing BabyBjorn in the summer wasn't comfortable for me."""
__label__neg	Just put your diaper in a plastic bag!
__label__pos	It works great.
__label__neg	"""Here are the things that stink (no pun intended) about it.."""
__label__neu	My mom got this tub for my daughter right after she was born.
__label__neg	This was a time consuming process and we likely spent much more energy than needed.
__label__neg	The drilling also made me really nervous
__label__neg	It leaves red indents on his cheeks. 
__label__neu	 It has to stand on two legs because you need to turn the swing
__label__neu	ive had many people comment on them.
__label__pos	"""I am selling all my avent bottles on ebay!"""
__label__neu	Because it's cheaper to get UL certification for a wall wart than to get certification for the whole device.
__label__neg	I bought this and returned it the next day. 
__label__neu	Even then,  it did a very poor job of grinding AND juice from the fruit leaked out the bottom of the mill.
__label__pos	We had the Graco Laura Ashley travel system and I used this frequently during the 8 months that my daughter fit in her infant seat.
__label__pos	I love that you can use regular plastic bags and don't need to buy refills for it.
__label__pos	Didn't work with any of the bottles we used
__label__pos	I'm very happy with the quality and design of this potty and I have NO complaints!
__label__pos	This is a really great product for the carseat, shopping cart, stroller, etc.  
__label__neg	After messing around with the lid for a good 10 minutes and thinking that it was on good; the cup *still* leaked.
__label__pos	"""I love this bag!"""
__label__pos	I guess it depends on what type of tub you have, but this was a great find for me. 
__label__neg	Despite being made  of cotton and having a 220 thread count,  it feels quite rough
__label__pos	We have loved all of the different feature as our daughter has grown.
__label__neg	which we did NOT expect!
__label__neu	For those with a dishwasher stick with the dishwasher.
__label__neu	I tried this on him for three days but I would get up to find him slid out of it,  giving me his mischievious grin
__label__neg	The suction cups do not work. 
__label__neu	I stick air freshners to it to compensate-I think that says it all.
__label__neu	I couldn't see spending a ton of money on a carried being my son was growing super quick.
__label__neu	Another option is to get the plate covers
__label__neu	She had been sleeping in a bassinet that had a small music/sound box attached and had gotten used to falling asleep to the sound of waves or trickling water.  
__label__pos	This is the best pack n' play.
__label__neu	There has been a new toy that fits my daughter's development from 2 weeks to 6 months.
__label__neg	Save your money and purchase something your baby really needs.
__label__neg	 She loved them and thought they were a cool new toy but they did not do the intended job
__label__neg	So, while I love this stroller for its ease of use, its exceptional maneuverability, its light weight, and the fact it's the only double stroller that fits into my Prius, that it's only good for twins up to 23 possibly 24 inches is a major design flaw
__label__neu	While the Constellation turtle is a cute idea,  it is poorly made.
__label__pos	"""They are easy for me and my husband to open and close (even with babies on the hips) but too difficult for my 3 year olds to operate."""
__label__neg	California climate I live in, it can get pretty warm during the day and this just creates way too much heat.
__label__pos	This chair works great because it elevates her to a position where she is totally comfortable and able to sleep.  
__label__neu	She would wake up when she got cold
__label__neu	Granted, he would not sit in any type of bouncy chair for very long (only the swing for him, which my daughter never used).
__label__pos	I was so pleased with it, I bought another one to keep in my Mother-In-law's car so I always had it handy.
__label__neu	It didn't fit well on my Graco snugride.
__label__pos	He's three months now and still loves it.
__label__neg	 This model has too many problems I wouldn't buy it if I could do it over again
__label__neg	"""Unfortunately, our baby has never been interested in this toy."""
__label__pos	 It is a fantastic seat and I would highly recommend that anyone looking at this seat consider the Boulevard instead. 
__label__pos	"""As a matter of fact, now that it's up again, my three-year-old likes to turn it on to watch and listen too."""
__label__neg	 Currently my baby is 23 inches long and the pocket for her legs force her to bend her knees
__label__neu	 He took it it, though later would prefer Avent paci's but this along with other artificial nipples added to problems I would have breastfeeding him
__label__pos	He loves to play with those toys
__label__neu	It has 4 9oz bottles, slow flow (number 2) nipples, 4 sealing disks, 4 travel nipple bases, and a newborn pacifier.
__label__neg	I am a pretty small woman (about a size 8) and I found that the donut-hole in the middle was so small it buckled in the front when I tried to put it around my waist.
__label__pos	I thought this bottle looked cute,  and it seemed easier to clean
__label__pos	The instructions were very clear and I was looking forward to installing the gates
__label__neu	I went to visit my parents in the US and sent one of these to their house.
__label__neu	 I think Dr. 
__label__neu	worst tub ever,  not worth it...  i bought the Eurobath instead (by Primo) which,  on the contrary,  is the best tub ever!
__label__neg	When they tip to the side,  the little hanging fish hit them in the face
__label__pos	"""It's cute, but not too cute."""
__label__pos	"""My daughter really liked to use this product."""
__label__neg	 There are marks around all of the handles caused from fingernails, and not just the fingernails of adults
__label__neg	 Not worth the money on the liners and there is plenty of air that gets into the liner even if once in a while you do manage to get the air out
__label__pos	The First Years makes a two pack of swaddling blankets which fit a 7 lb. baby perfectly.  
__label__pos	No regrets!
__label__pos	The mat also washes easily and dries quickly.
__label__neu	"""I also spray the inside w/ febreeze or lysol disinfectant during each change and that nips the problem in the bud."""
__label__pos	"""Overall, I""m very pleased."""
__label__neu	I even used the different types of refills that were made for it...ie.
__label__pos	It works much better.
__label__pos	Would be nice if the white container was made with a little cushion for the small tush, but it's nice in that it's easy to clean and easy for the little ones to sit on.
__label__neu	If you have a bra that fits a bra pad will stay in place
__label__pos	Our husbands are both much larger then we are and we're able to use this universally.
__label__neu	We also got the mobile, the lamp, and the wall hangings.
__label__neu	"""I recommend using them before you have the baby though."""
__label__neg	My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag.
__label__pos	i have washed it several times, and it handles well in the washer/dryer.
__label__neg	 Very poorly designed
__label__pos	At first the pump worked great
__label__pos	So far, it works perfectly and our 10 month old is not able to get into the cabinets now
__label__pos	A great take along toy!
__label__neg	 Sadly the chest went to the curb
__label__neg	 My 2 mo
__label__pos	However, we were drawn to the bouncenette's pretty neutral color and seeming usefulness.
__label__pos	I used this product a lot when breastfeeding in public.
__label__neu	The camera unit has to be hooked up to the AC adapter most of the day and the monitor has to get recharged every 4 hours.
__label__neg	6. Very Expensive, and in this case we didn't get a better product for the money.
__label__neu	So,  we switched to using the sleep sack we received instead and it worked MUCH better.
__label__neu	"""LOL, all you have to do is squeeze the nipple once or twice, which pushes the air down and pulls the liquid up."""
__label__neg	Rather than risk it, we haven't used it.
__label__pos	It is pleasant to look at and always catches my sons eye.
__label__neg	First of all, you should not install this in your car as it can become a projectile in an accident (as the police officer who installed my car seat told me.)Second of all, When you buy this mirror it comes with a 'protective' piece of plastic over the mirror that you have to remove to use the mirror, but when you remove it, you see that the mirror is very foggy. 
__label__neu	For the bigger ticket toys, it is worthwile to know how it will be received before you make the purchase.
__label__neu	Got it as a gift and was very skeptical about it at first.
__label__neg	Needs to be re-called.
__label__pos	He loves them!
__label__neu	Plus it comes with some lanolin just incase you get sore nipples.
__label__pos	I have a toddler & a nb that I carry in the Moby all the time! 
__label__neg	 However, one afternoon I found it bunched up around my 1 month old daughters neck
__label__neg	 personnel has recommended we not use the infant seat in our car
__label__neu	"""We clean the diaper genie every week."""
__label__pos	"""This set is wonderful."""
__label__pos	It's affordable5. 
__label__pos	We go on picnics all summer and this is great!  
__label__neu	I wouldn't want a toddler getting near this organizer!
__label__neu	These bottles suck!
__label__neg	And the ones Avent offers to replace them with if you call to complain also leak.
__label__neg	"""The 1st couple of times I put her in it she didn't seem all that interested."""
__label__neg	Also the on/off switch is impossible to use.
__label__neu	"""Now, if you have any good car-seats, etc."""
__label__neu	i like the tub but my daughters hiney slides too much when i try to put her in the infant side.  
__label__neg	Leaked too much milk (and as any BFing mother knows
__label__neg	AND it's too short
__label__neu	In conclusion we highly reccomend this chair the only drawback is the hefty pricetag but a chair to last through childhood.
__label__pos	Plus, it fits my 6'5 husband and the Bjorn does not
__label__pos	It packs in my diaper bag compactly,  too
__label__neu	I finally threw it away and for my newest baby I bought a Diaper Champ which I love and find to be a cheaper,  better option.
__label__pos	I love that it is portable, it can convert to a freestanding bassinet, also serve as a changing table, and later a playpen!
__label__neu	"""My wife picked up this little floating thermometer for our baby's bath."""
__label__pos	"""It smells rubbery (not plasticky) but that doesn't seem to dissuade the little ones."""
__label__neu	Originally I had registered for a different monitor,  but I had to make a change when I looked into the frequency of my wireless internet
__label__neg	"""But I think it is way too expensive for what it is."""
__label__neg	We also had to buy 4 of these toeven find one that wasn't broken when we took it out of the box.
__label__neg	 Its like the newest designed Xbox 360 still has a 50% failure rating
__label__neg	I am happy with the way they handled it,  but I wish it would've never happend
__label__neg	Do not use/purchase this nurser/bottle if you boil your bottles to sterilize them due to you or your child being sick.
__label__neg	"""Also-I took mine back because my son kept getting his arm stuck between the seat and the arm that hooks over my tub!"""
__label__neu	when i pressed it to lock the extension,  i couldn't tell whether it locked or not,  so then i put water to test the lock system.
__label__pos	We wouldn't want to sterilize any other way!
__label__neu	Well you miss the whole lower corner of the window.
__label__pos	Other than that great toy!
__label__pos	"""I bought this for my son because they have similar ones at his day care that he loves to play with."""
__label__neu	The toys are a little low but it doesn't bother us.
__label__neu	It would stay sealed for a couple pumps,  then unseal and seal again--off and on.
__label__neu	"One lady referred to it as a ""totally fabulous situation"" when she came up to us in the store and gestured to it"
__label__neu	"""We bought this last week for my 6 month old daughter."""
__label__neu	We've had the toilets locked so long that it's never paid off for him to try to play in there and he can't get into it even if he tries.I have to get more, I broke one on accident.
__label__pos	She doesnt seem to really care for the massage part but she loves the music.
__label__neu	Period.
__label__neu	The directions say you need to disassemble the lid, but I've found that it gets perfectly clean if you leave it assembled.
__label__neu	You can puch the air out so you dont have to worry about it. 
__label__pos	I was sick of pushing my original Chicco Mamma High Chair around the kitchen and out of the way so I bought this.
__label__neg	 You're supposed to squeeze it and it acts like a squeeze toy and is SUPPOSED to make the water run
__label__neu	 He got some sleep but I didn't
__label__neu	The purpose is to keep leaking of air from the valve stem over time to a minimum.
__label__pos	It's that easy.
__label__neg	Unfortunately, they are such a nightmare to wash and assemble.
__label__neg	In my opinion, this is in NO way similar to breastfeeding
__label__neg	It sure isn't a quiet swing, it makes a clicking noise everytime it goes back and forth.
__label__neg	She slept better when swaddled so we didn't mind paying the extra $$ on the electric bill every month.
__label__pos	Best Booster seat ever!
__label__neu	A few told me playtex but most told me Avent bottles and sippy cups were the only way to go.
__label__neu	You might want to try it for an older baby or toddler who is not adapting to other styles.
__label__neu	But this company is wonderful. 
__label__neg	 I am in the last half of my 2nd trimester, so maybe I'll use it more later, but for now it works best for back support when I'm sitting on the couch
__label__neu	Our little one had reflux and anytime we put him in the carrier it was a royal mess.
__label__neu	I don't hate this pacifier really. 
__label__neg	 The bottles are not comfortable for people with small hands (or stubby fingers) to hold, and the worst part is with the nipples, which are made of semi-hard plastic and too large for young babies. 
__label__neu	You save a lot of money when you buy this in bulk rather than buying them individually.
__label__neu	There is also a removable cover and handles and the silicone sleeve comes off if you want to wash either the bottle or cover.
__label__neu	"The packaging will say ""Polypropylene"" bottles.  "
__label__neg	oh my gosh.
__label__neg	He would suck 10 times and the nipple would be colapsed.
__label__neg	"""Just use the old-fashioned, flat covers instead."""
__label__neu	especially to nervous first time parents.
__label__neu	[The number of germs on a toilet handle, btw, is only 50,000]
__label__neg	 Not sure if others have noticed but it does get moldy in the cracks & is extremely difficult to clean because of the shape
__label__pos	My daughter sits on it sometimes (she's almost 4), and it's not flat after 3 years.
__label__neu	Note that this does not come with bottles.
__label__pos	Worth every penny!
__label__neg	The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that most wipe refills they sell don't have a layered configuration for easy dispencing, so you have to lift the lid each time you want a wipe. 
__label__neu	 We call the nursery @ the hospital & asked them why
__label__neu	The toys that it comes with are fine though I was glad I had extra rings to dangle them down further as they really were up to high.
__label__pos	The happy sun prism glows in the sunlight, and this toy always brings a smile to her face.
__label__neu	You will know within days if your child will take to it.
__label__pos	"""I definitely recommend this tub!"""
__label__neg	kinda cuteWont recommend to anyone
__label__neu	We got this infant seat from a local Once Upon a Child.
__label__neu	BUY this for your friends and family! 
__label__neu	I have no idea why it's in the Amazon BPA-free store.
__label__neu	One thing I'd like to mention is not to have the 2 pieces close to each other - they create a high pitch sound or begin to alarm that they are out of range of each other.
__label__pos	"""These work very well."""
__label__neg	If you wash it, the music stops playing though, lol.
__label__neu	"""He is now 5 months and plays with them by kicking them and picking them up, holding and turning them."""
__label__pos	The nipple is very wide and shaped more naturally than other bottles. 
__label__pos	I got these for my son when he was 4 months old and it was instantly his favorite toy.
__label__neg	"""My 11 month old can take these off with no problem."""
__label__pos	These are great soothers for our twin boys.
__label__neu	He's now getting big enough that he stands in it (at lowest setting) and whirls around from side to side.
__label__neg	 I decided to try this one since the previous reviews rave about decrease in the dribbling of milk, however, this did not work for me
__label__pos	And not space consuming.
__label__neg	The whole thing feels flimsy and cheap.  
__label__neu	We go to a lot of outside events (car shows) where a bottle can't be warmed so easily.  
__label__neg	It does not fit well into my husbands Civic.
__label__pos	"""Every parent should have one (or several) of these."""
__label__pos	I love that you can attach it to anything.
__label__pos	I am thrilled with this little booster seat and I have no desire to bring a big traditional high chair into our small dining room.
__label__neg	In addition to the annoying beeping from disconnects, there are static pops, most likely from power line interfereance.
__label__neu	UPDATE
__label__neu	I just have to lift the mattress,  and it takes two seconds
__label__neg	Our son was always banging his legs into the darned things, until one day he propped a foot up on the fish and pushed -- it broke right off!
__label__neg	It's a little bit awkward to carry one-handed, and the legs, when open, are too wide to fit through the doorways of my 1850's apartment so I'd need to put the baby down to fold it-- too many steps!
__label__neu	i have attached a crib mobile to this table to keep katie happy during diaper time.
__label__pos	I like to be able to see behind me because it helps me gauge my reaction in an emergency situation.
__label__neg	 a phase that this tub doesn't suitably deal with
__label__pos	D Overall,  I find this product great and would recommend it to others
__label__pos	It is affordable, which is one of the features that makes it is great (having a baby, especially the 1st one, is expensive enough).You can use the Avent bottles and magic cups interchangably for milk storage, so there are fewer things you have to wash.
__label__neg	even when it does, it's hard to get it out. 
__label__neu	When they don't, they don't. 
__label__neu	MY daughter has been playing with it since she turn one.
__label__pos	"""It has worked very well."""
__label__pos	These sheets are wonderful!
__label__pos	"""My baby always smiles and laughs when she looks at this mobile."""
__label__neg	So far this isn't useful to me
__label__neg	I think air was getting in around her mouth b/c milk was always leaking out of her mouth too.
__label__neu	I suppose you could leave it on the entire time but there's times when you don't really want the thing on.
__label__neu	We really thought he would - it's so soft and snugly
__label__neg	 i would ahve to pour the leftover formula into a regular bottle to see how much he ate which was bad when i thought he wasnt eating enough
__label__neu	we said they were sitting in their pool.
__label__pos	I highly recommed this product if you want a clean,  simple,  and convenient diaper pail
__label__neg	Before he cried all the time and we never knew why.
__label__neg	 The sling was poorly made and the sprayer broke after 5 uses. 
__label__pos	I also love that there is no nipple air pocket that seems to look grungy very quickly.
__label__neg	 I felt I could not get the pillow in position to be comfortable
__label__neu	When fully tightened in the rear-facing position using the LATCH system, both could be grasped by their bases from the front seat and pulled forward, pushing baby's head into the back seat.  
__label__pos	It was the most perfect thing to use when our daughter's belly button had not yet healed.
__label__neg	If they had cost less, I wouldn't have been so disappointed in the quality.
__label__neg	But it is hard to find sometimes because it doesn't have color.
__label__neu	99 to pour into other brands of bottles.
__label__pos	Wipes up nice and clean with antibacterial wipes.
__label__neg	 Video is an unnecessary expense, because just what is there to SEE inside a baby's crib anyway
__label__neg	EVERY bottle I bought was a newborn bottle- with newborn nipples ( I double and triple checked) but for some reason they ALL had different flows!
__label__neu	I tried it and thought I'd nock the table over it took so much pressure so I stopped.
__label__pos	Can easily fit on any stroller since it has velcro straps that are adjustable to most style of strollers
__label__pos	I have read other reviews about the safety issues of this chair, but when used properly for the appropriate age - it is very safe!!
__label__neg	" You can't warm it nipple-up either, because the stupid ""petal valve"" at the other end will leak out the milk too"
__label__neg	My dog ended up with this pillow because it was so horrible. 
__label__neu	Not worth the hassle.
__label__neg	"What's more,  other ""safety"" products I have purchased that use well-known 3M tape were defective as well."
__label__pos	Rubberized balls would be much quieter and much smoother rollers than plastic.
__label__neu	The pump also fits standard bottles. 
__label__neu	I had wondered if this product was gimmicky but after mixing formula all the time and storing it in bottles in the fridge I decided to give the pitcher a try.
__label__neu	You can use any regular trash bag.
__label__neu	"""I assumed her kids liked this toy and that's why she'd given us one (I hadn't requested it on our registry)."""
__label__neg	Unless the bottle is a regular generic bottle with a gallon of fluid inside,  it won't keep the heating latch engaged
__label__neu	It's a cute swing and I would highly recommend it.
__label__neg	When using these bottles with my newborn,  stage 1 flow was very fast for her
__label__pos	It was so much better than the pillow that the hospital gave me for the same purpose.
__label__pos	Gets the job done
__label__neg	 I would never have gotten this far with the Boppy. 
__label__neg	The only thing I would caution is that if you're needing them to protect a cloth diaper from an oil- based cream you might want to fold it or use two liners since they are so thin.
__label__neg	"""If it magnified it may be better..."""
__label__neu	My only complaint - the music has to be restarted too often!
__label__neg	Then when I tried one of the positions my baby either kept hitting his head on the ring or grabbing onto it
__label__neu	4 Ghz monitors can cause interference
__label__neg	 Returns during the busiest week of the year
__label__pos	It will dry extremely fast and get really clean.
__label__neu	Initially the diapers seemed a little small in the large container but I soon discovered that newborn diapers could be stacked in two stacks which means the container holds twice as many
__label__neg	"This means that if the wheels are dirty, there is no ""clean side."""
__label__pos	"""I currently expecting my 2nd child and was thinking of getting an electric pump, but after reading the reviews and the time it takes to express milk; I thought to myself why waste money if it's going to take the same amount of time."""
__label__neu	If you are going to the toilet to rinse a diaper that could be a bit awkward,  but a minor inconvenience in exchange with your child's safety,  I think
__label__pos	The safety rating is the best.
__label__neu	We use this to organize creams, wipes and diapers on the changing table.
__label__neu	They are cute in his room.
__label__pos	"""My son also loved the music, light and mobile."""
__label__neu	I have two of these dishwasher baskets, but I do not have the valve basket. 
__label__pos	There are no bad smells until you open it
__label__pos	"""Best $12 I ever spent!"""
__label__neg	"""Outrageous to all intelligent parents out there."""
__label__neu	My son holds her against his body under his arm and tries to knaw on her head and ears.
__label__neu	I've had it in my car for months,  but I can't bring myself to give it another try.
__label__neu	cannot seem to get it to wrap tight enough to make me feel secure to tote bubbies around.
__label__neu	Luckily if the motor does go out for me, I have the old one that still works too.
__label__pos	It cut down on the gas problems my daughter had and really I had no trouble cleaning them.
__label__neg	Sometimes now,  I'll just be walking by it,  without pushing anything,  and it will shout out a random color
__label__neu	I tried the cosleeper without it for a week and it was breaking my back to dip down to pick up the baby to breastfeed at night.Giving birth naturally injured my back/hip.
__label__neu	I bought one regular sheet to cover the mattress,  and I've never taken it off
__label__neu	Too bad the Vent Aires didnt work b/c they are the cutest bottles of the 3 though.
__label__neu	We bought two of these to have on eat each toilet
__label__pos	"""This is the tallest baby gate I've seen - definitely too tall for my dog to get over."""
__label__pos	My daughter sleeps in this like her regular crib and I think we will get a lot of use from it!
__label__neu	Even got the hubbie to use it!
__label__neu	, sesame street, dora, etc)
__label__neg	I was reluctant to register for this tub because it was so affordable.
__label__pos	We on the other hand love these locks.
__label__pos	"""So I switched to Playtex after finding out that it offered BPA-free disposable liners."""
__label__pos	Reasons why I'm glad I bought it
__label__neg	 The flip-up design enabled by the chains is a nice idea in theory, but doesn't work in practice. 
__label__neu	I originally bought an Ameda electric pump.
__label__neg	I wish this blanket wasn't so expensive! 
__label__neu	He'll use it for about 10 minutes, then he wants it off.  
__label__pos	A Must Have - Great for naps
__label__neu	So if you're looking for something to address a colic/feeding problem,  that's the way to go
__label__pos	"""She sat for almost an hour in awe."""
__label__pos	The thermos keeps the same temperature for several hours (or I make the water really hot if I think that I won't be using it until later in the day).
__label__neg	you can't turn it off,  you just have to take the thing apart
__label__neu	I am glad I did because we instantly picked up the neighbor's baby who lives in the townhouse 3 doors down from us- imagine the confusion
__label__neg	It's also just not as interesting to look at or chew as many other toys we've tried.
__label__pos	"""Great essential product."""
__label__neg	And the ones that Avent will offer to send you as replacements also leak
__label__neg	Also the snaps didn't match up well w/ my cribs slats and even if they did they were too long to actually be safe and secure.
__label__pos	"""For comparison, the First Years bags are flimsy plastic (one actually ripped); the Lansinoh bags are nice material but big and bulky (can't attach to pump mechanism)."""
__label__neu	etc
__label__neg	 He would be half out of the top after an hour or so. 
__label__pos	So I rate the item very high, but check out your product when you receive it because the FedEx guys really beat ours up!
__label__neu	It also hurts sometimes when it get stuck under your nail as you try to pry it off your child.
__label__neu	In my case,  it was prune juice and the baby's medicine
__label__neu	I tried every bottle imaginable for my daughter.
__label__neu	We also added the Natures Touch Cradle Swing to our registry.  
__label__neu	So you see love the swing wouldn't live w/out one of these but fisher price could have easily perfected this one and had the market for a few dollars more.
__label__pos	It has a nice rubber grip on the bottom to keep it in the same place on the floor.
__label__pos	It will also save you some money because you won't need to buy the Breast Milk Storage kit.
__label__neg	 It was useless after I took it apart and had to wash it
__label__neu	The mobile will start back up at that point.
__label__neg	So we took it back.
__label__neu	"""just don't put the suction cups on the grout lines."""
__label__neg	I went back to the Vent Aire bottle I started out with.
__label__neu	"""I was in the hosptital last year for a few days, in order to keep my milk supply, they gave me a Medela pump and let me used their (rental unit) Lactina."""
__label__neg	I was not disappointed in the quality of the bottle, but I was not overly impressed.
__label__neu	Too big to put it on top of a kitchen sink.
__label__pos	I love these bottles.VARIABLE FLOW- There are several different grades of nipples.
__label__neg	Ack.
__label__neg	"All I got is that ""the materials in our products meet global phthalate and BPA requirements"", a remarkable statement given that, to the best of my knowledge, there are no such global requirements (every country has their own widely varying safety standards, and the US regulations in particular are ridiculously out of date with the current research that suggests that even small amounts of BPA are harmful)."
__label__neu	The way the wrap goes round means that the weight of your little one is spread across you back in hips
__label__neg	 NOT worth the $$$ I would just buy the Tummy Wedge by Boppy for Belly Support :) Cheaper & does the job
__label__neu	If you are considering this maybe try the one with the tray which would prohibit such movement and possible injury.
__label__neu	I recommend buying a regular tub with a sling rather than spending the few extra bucks for the sprayer that doesn't work that well.  
__label__pos	This playyard is amazing!
__label__pos	I like it otherwise.
__label__neg	There's a rubber insert on the flat side which you're supposed to press against your child's head to make a seal so the water only flows back from that point.
__label__pos	I hope this information is helpful to anyone deciding which play gym to chose for thier baby.
__label__neu	This is the only way you'll know.  
__label__pos	"""It comes with labels to insert under the sonogram photo."""
__label__neg	The nipples are very hard (not like the breast at all
__label__neg	 I have to put air freshners inside it to help with the odor. 
__label__neu	I bought these bottles for my baby who is a big spitter.
__label__pos	On the plus side, this item really taught my daughter to walk next to me and listen to me LOLWe used it a couple of time and put it aside. 
__label__pos	Besides using it as a nursing cover up I used it as a sun shade all the time.
__label__neg	I liked that bottle cuz it was pretty small and comfortable for my child to grip,  but leaking takes all good away
__label__neg	So you can pump and use,  just as you would with these bottles.
__label__neg	 Plus, a lot cheaper
__label__neu	Our son has started to teeth so several moms reccomended this teether. 
__label__neg	 I tried so hard to putting it back together
__label__pos	"""OH..."""
__label__neu	Hopefully this will help.
__label__pos	Works well for flat or inverted nipples.
__label__neu	I wouln't use something like this in the crib though but carseat or playtime is perfect.
__label__neg	We don't even turn on the lights for our baby because they distract him
__label__neu	to attach toys with
__label__neg	These were just about the worst
__label__pos	"""The animals are fabulous to look at - black and white plus bold colors, with buggy eyes to boot."""
__label__neu	Save your money and buy an Amazing Miracle Blanket instead.
__label__neg	It's going back.
__label__pos	You definitely want this one on your registry!
__label__pos	I'll stick with my Soothies
__label__neg	Honestly, I don't see the point in buying a more expensive one.
__label__neu	I bought another model that places more weight on your hips
__label__pos	"""It also keeps your vehicle seat from getting indentations from the car seat as well."""
__label__pos	"""There is a small splash guard (more like a ridge) in the seat so no ""fountaining"" can occur."""
__label__pos	Pretty much like the Safety 1st Neat diaper disposal system but with some improvements.
__label__neu	You only need one hand to throw the soiled diaper away.
__label__neu	I thought these bottles were a lot of trouble and aggravation.
__label__neg	Maybe this potty is better for a girl but definately not a boy. 
__label__pos	No more forgetting to replace the cover when I'm done!
__label__pos	While you would never leave a child unattended - it does provide a great deal of support.
__label__neg	Wish I had saved my receipt!
__label__pos	very quiet
__label__neu	It is possible with the two toys on the end but I haven't seen them do damage yet.
__label__neg	The last thing you want when addressing any feeding problem is resistance to your baby's suckling
__label__neg	I am not rating this very highly because my daughter's head still flopped around quite a lot when I used it because babies' car seats have them sitting almost upright even as newborns.
__label__neg	Very disappointing (and my kitchen is still a mess, too).
__label__pos	I think it's a great product, just that my 15 mo daughter is too independent to like it... she likes playing with it, instead...
__label__neu	It doesn't actually swing.
__label__neg	In addition,  there is no way to travel with it because it doesn't have a top to keep it from leaking everywhere
__label__pos	Other than that, I have had no issues.
__label__pos	"""because he was looking forward to the ""Goodnight Toes"" story."""
__label__neg	It also attaches kind of funky - you have to fold back the fabric on the side bars and snap it over a little button, which doesn't hold it securely at all.
__label__pos	But, I gave it a few more tries and have really come to appreciate this product.
__label__pos	"""Cloth diapering has come such a long way, these type products make it a snap to do this now - why would you choose any other option!"""
__label__neu	change at least twice per week (especially in the summer) and you are good to go.
__label__pos	holds very few diapers -- must be changed every few days(Diaper Dekor holds at 5x as many diapers
__label__pos	My daughter will lift it off,  wait till it comes on,  and then sets it back on the charger,  then gets into bed,  and she is only 3.
__label__neu	She started at 3 weeks after i tried breast feeding.
__label__pos	this is a great washing tool for baby.
__label__pos	Great swing
__label__neu	Unless your are planning to remodel your bathroom to fit this monster,  go for something else.
__label__neu	Before using to warm actual food or milk for my son I tested it out
__label__pos	"""I like it because she looks comfy on it and it keeps her on her side."""
__label__pos	Highly recommended.
__label__pos	Bright vibrant primary colors typical of Fisher Price, sweet as can be.  
__label__neg	They have never leaked and I'm not afraid to look in the bottle bag anymore when we are out!
__label__pos	 The nipples on the Playtex Nurser are much softer and mimic the breast much more closely than the Avent
__label__neg	After the baby was born and passed his stage of dry bath, I found this tub is not very easy to use. 
__label__pos	This adapter and plug cover works very well.
__label__neu	We have the changing table in our bedroom and the Diaper Dekor right beside it.  
__label__pos	You can pump and use your other hand to cook.
__label__neg	I echo all of the problems pointed out by the negative reviews: the shower sprayer has never worked, and the tub is too short with the sprayer unit in place in the tub. 
__label__pos	"""My son absolutely loves this swing."""
__label__neg	" Finally, I used it with the changing pad by ""Especially for Baby"" and the fit was a bit too tight which resulted in the pad curving a bit over time"
__label__neg	This brand is harder to close,  more time consuming and wasteful (due to spilling
__label__neu	We felt that baby would be hanging over the top of the gate and fall down the steps (Jay is already 33 inches tall).
__label__neg	We tried to install his under our car seat, but it didn't fit easily under the seat base in our small car, and seemed to make installation more difficult.
__label__neu	I recommend Dr
__label__pos	He had so much fun in this!
__label__neu	It is a mess waiting to happen.
__label__neg	My hubby is much larger than I and the specifications of what size straps to buy for the BB were confusing.
__label__neu	Money down the drain.
__label__neg	"I am 5'6"" & 130 pounds."
__label__pos	"""My kids loved to bat at these bugs and each bug makes a different noise too!"""
__label__neu	I'll keep trying...
__label__neu	I do not own this tub,  but used it for a week when I was visiting my girlfriend who has it.
__label__pos	She would smile, and talk to this mobile.  
__label__pos	), because I've used these myself a couple times in a pinch when cold or napping, and they're great!
__label__neg	I love the design/look of this,  but we also had problems with soap leaking out
__label__neu	"The bottles (we use VentAir) do not touch the ""on"" sensor,  and it takes more than 30 minutes to warm our 8 oz bottles."
__label__neg	My 21 month old daughter hated to get her hair rinsed either by laying her down to rinse or pour water over her head.
__label__neu	Its cheaper,  I don't have to order it online,  and it actually works better.
__label__neg	I put in on my coffe table and end tables and they are all damage because of the tape
__label__neu	When I called Britax about the second buckle - they told me it was normal for there not to be a clicking noise when the clips go into the buckle
__label__neu	The main ingredient in this is petroleum jelly which you can get for 99 cents at WalMart
__label__pos	It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it's fairly inexpensive as baby products go!
__label__pos	When I put it on the crib, it looked very nice and while my daughter was little and imobile, it was very useful. 
__label__neg	"Now that my son has 4 teeth he chews on the part that attaches to the bottle or sippy cup I have found the rubber ""grippy liner"" in his mouth."
__label__neg	 First of all, the instructions are not user friendly
__label__pos	The padding on the strap is great - very plush, and has a no-slide grip - kind of like felt, but not exactly.
__label__pos	I especially like how it makes the pack n play seem a little more comfortable without compromising safety.
__label__neg	Air/sun drying them leaves them super stiff. 
__label__pos	It was advertised as having flashing lights & music, and it looked cute from the box.
__label__pos	Works well as diaper pail but it's awesome as a bathroom garbage can.
__label__pos	"""Play with toys and it was convenient to feed him in."""
__label__pos	"""I love this ""baby gate."""""
__label__pos	And, I didn't mind wearing it.
__label__pos	The toy is also very entertaining.
__label__neu	Invest your money in the real thing it's worth it!
__label__pos	This also ensures that the next wipe (the one on top) will be the warmest...that makes sense!
__label__neu	Got this bouncer at the baby shower last summer.
__label__neg	They do not go through loops that hang down from the bar, but rather velcro onto it.
__label__neu	It claims to heat up the bottle in 4 minutes but the milk is unevenly heated,  the top of the bottle is cold and the base is scalding.
__label__neu	Your better off untwisting the tie and pouring it from there.
__label__neu	2 problems with this bib.
__label__pos	This was a great purchase very useful and I would recommend it to anyone.
__label__pos	So overall I love the Diaper Champ!
__label__pos	The non skid pads in the infant side are a great feature, and the high angled back is very supportive.
__label__pos	"""And for what it offers, the price is very attractive."""
__label__neg	My son is on the large size.
__label__neg	 my daughter had very bad gas
__label__neg	 they fit together in a very odd way, and young children will have a difficult time figuring out how exactly which part goes in which as well as actually pushing them together
__label__neu	We should get two though - one for each car.
__label__neu	I don't have to hold him up until I have to wash his back area.  
__label__neg	However, the same brand, with the absorbent center pad, is much better.
__label__neu	"""Good Luck!"""
__label__neg	 I'd prefer to use something softer so my daughter is comfortable playing
__label__neg	I am requesting a replacement but we are disappointed in its workmanship as my baby just loves her Sleep Sheep!
__label__pos	my daughter loves the animals and it is really very stimulating in color design and motion.
__label__neu	But she gets cold easily so we bought a big bath sponge instead
__label__pos	Perfect for the park, beach, or even at amusement parks to stake out your place.
__label__pos	I don't know what we would've done without it.
__label__neu	even using screwdrivers and various other tools to try to pry them off. 
__label__neu	Edited to say: At almost 8 months we are still using this bathtub!
__label__pos	What could be better than laying your head on a pillow to eat?
__label__neg	 The rubber filter keeps popping out when there is a lot of suction
__label__neg	 It's not being played with at a rate that warrants having to change the batteries once or twice a week
__label__neu	It's better for baby anyways
__label__pos	Overall I like this ExerSaucer.
__label__neg	With all the baby accidents on the clothing that gets put into this hamper, it gets a bit gamey. 
__label__neu	I was really disappointed,  and my daughter prefers the music buttons from her Tiny Love Activity Center.
__label__neg	 or max
__label__neg	 The colour of the material was a bit ho hum but that wouldn't have caused me too much angst
__label__pos	 She does like banging on the steering wheel and playing with the little gadgets on the sides though
__label__neu	Dr. Brown's is the way to go!
__label__pos	My daughter is 20 months old and loves to do it ALL herself.
__label__pos	No complaints.
__label__neg	It did not allow her to move her arms where she wanted to.
__label__neu	I bought this when my daughter graduated to the big crib at three months.
__label__neu	that's much better than this deal
__label__neu	She has also used the Halo Sleepsack Swaddles which her arms go through a sleeveless shirt and the swaddles wrap around the outside.
__label__pos	We like using this rocker for our baby.
__label__neg	If purchasing this item make sure you can place it somewhere where there is an outlet, be able to place it on some sort of protector to protect your changing table from water damage, and also be prepared to also buy the travel wipes warmer because your little one will get use to their bottom only being wiped with warm wipes which is not always so convenient if your out and about or traveling.
__label__neg	My advice is to wait a few days before purchasing this item, to see if you really need it.
__label__neg	"""Both Diaper Champ and Genie cut down on the smell but you are asking for a miracle if you think you are never going to smell poop in your baby's room."""
__label__neu	We made him choose from all the one they had at Babies'R'Us.
__label__neg	 Ugh
__label__pos	I have used 4 of the other top brands and am very pleased with Avent.
__label__pos	"""My daughter definately seems to like the warm wipes better as she doesn't ever flinch or cry like she will with the cold ones."""
__label__pos	Fits gerber bottles too.
__label__neu	There is a comfortable pad for her,  a night light for checkups in the middle of the night,  and a vibrator feature.
__label__neu	For wipes I use a combination of kushies flannel wipes and bum genius wipes.
__label__pos	I keep all of the out grown small bottles in the container and it works great~!
__label__neu	He's almost 5 months old
__label__pos	My daughter loved it from day one (it was the only way we could get her to sleep at night for the first 2 weeks!).
__label__pos	You can adjust the speed which is nice
__label__neg	The fabric has an unpleasant feel and the zipper began to break after only one use.
__label__neg	Don't waste your money on this product
__label__pos	Although I debate the necessity of ANY diaper pail, this one receives 5 stars from me!
__label__neg	Brown's 8-ounce bottles (regular width,  not sure about wide).
__label__neu	If I'd spent less initially,  I would have given it a higher rating even with the problems
__label__neu	I used this when I became too sore to use my electric pump. 
__label__neu	I own Britax Vigour which I really love but it takes a lot of space in a trank so I wanted something lighter and more compact in folding. 
__label__neg	 This applies when using the bottle with a heavier baby as well
__label__pos	It is soft, thick and washes very well. 
__label__pos	love it
__label__neu	Sometimes they would be scalding hot,  sometimes ice cold (and then you have to wait until it's completely cooled down before it will allow you to heat it again!
__label__neg	You twist the inside ring and ONLY cut when the Genie is full.
__label__neg	i am disappionted this didn't come more complete for the price
__label__pos	We used it the day we got home from the hospital and for months after that!
__label__pos	it grows with your baby
__label__neg	 It's an okay toy I guess, but don't expect anything spectacular
__label__neg	My daughter really likes the cold of the frozen teether rings, but just can't seem to hold on to it long enough because it's too cold for her hands.
__label__neg	I also found that it tends to move (slightly) even when attached.
__label__pos	"""Enjoy!"""
__label__neu	We now own two of these gates/yards. 
__label__pos	It looked so nice and the assembly was pretty quick and easy.
__label__pos	plus she was easier to burb. 
__label__pos	, and the style is great (it looks more like a messenger bag until you're close up) & I've recieved lots of complements
__label__neu	He'd cry within minutes of being put into it.
__label__pos	 It's even better to prop your baby up with for tummy time or to sit. 
__label__pos	This monitor helps us keep peace of mind and be able to rest.
__label__pos	Never, ever buy from this company. 
__label__pos	The seat sets in the base easier, the handle to release the seat from the base uses less force, the straps have not once gotten folded over or creased, this is a big plus for me, I hate it when the straps get mangled, which happened with my other seats.  
__label__neg	Not too good solution
__label__pos	"""She is starting to get a little long for it, but that's OK because she sleeps just fine."""
__label__neu	I've eaten over my daughter many evenings!
__label__neu	Bought this for my 3 month old because, quite frankly, it just looked too cute to pass up and she needed more toys. 
__label__pos	"""Now, my second son is enjoying it."""
__label__neg	The SIDS alliance suggests not using anything in the crib, including any of these sleep positioners or wedges, because the baby could kick his way down and suffocate against the foam bars. 
__label__pos	"""It was really easy to install, too."""
__label__neu	I bought mine March 9,  2009 and it's August 7,  2009 and it no longer works.
__label__neu	It doesn't hold many bottles,  especially since I use the Dr.
__label__pos	Good product.
__label__neg	It kept lifting the corners of the floor mat.
__label__pos	"""Our baby, now 5 months old, loves his Pupsqueak and has since he was 4 or 5 weeks old."""
__label__pos	 I am frequently in stop and go traffic so it is nice to know what she is doing back there
__label__neu	"""I found that the items I needed to use it with (the carseat, the stroller, the swing, etc.), came with their own headrest."""
__label__pos	Once i tried these bottles, we were home free!
__label__neu	Later she kicked off her blankets when in her crib.
__label__neu	it scratched my baby's scalp.
__label__pos	I have now transitioned him to the tub with out the sling and the erogonomic design and non slip back pad, really keep him in place comfortably.
__label__pos	This is a cute chair, it must be comfortable, because my grandson will sit on it for quite a while.
__label__neu	Terrible product & I am replacing them with a better brand.
__label__neu	Very disappointing
__label__pos	i liked the product for its ease of use.. 
__label__neg	"""it doesn't bounce!)."""
__label__neu	One of the benefits of this over a bowl is that the lid keeps the bottle being warmed from floating out of the water
__label__neg	The only convenient thing about this is that you can put whatever garbage bag you want in it and even then,  the bag can hold many diapers.
__label__neu	Haven't had any accidents to report on the function.
__label__neu	"""This is the second swaddling blanket I have bought."""
__label__pos	"""It is not anymore difficult than emptying my kitchen trashcan and it smells a lot better!"""
__label__neg	The spout leaks (nothing magic about those cups) and the collars can leak too.
__label__pos	"""I could hear the fan rotating."""
__label__neg	This monitor did not work for us. 
__label__neu	But my son would just slip down and would cry because it was uncomfortable for him.
__label__neg	My only problem is that it's a little complicated.
__label__pos	A blessing for cracked nipples!
__label__neu	roll some receiving blankets and viola
__label__neg	Listen to the reviews--don't waste your money.
__label__neu	However,  some lids were hard to remove and others easily removed
__label__pos	I love this bather and could NOT do without it!
__label__neu	I am STILL looking for a good alternate and might try the Tikes Turtle divider plate with lid instead
__label__neg	I bought two of these and thank goodness BRU let me take them back. 
__label__pos	"""Easy to clean, easy to use, and come in some cute colors!"""
__label__pos	It makes turns well and is easy to fold up and pick up - it is a bit long with the carseat attatchment on it, but I havent had a problem with it-  it is easy to remove and put back on and at 6 months- baby can sit in stroller seat. 
__label__neg	I can't get to all his parts.
__label__neu	I was able to take pieces from both to make a useable one.
__label__neu	I sent them back and ordered an accordian style gate instead
__label__neg	Most of the time it's annoying.
__label__neg	It is actually harder to make the harness tight enough.
__label__neu	It's impossible to avoid things made in China.  
__label__pos	I needed a tub that would be good for my very small son.
__label__neu	 Some similar carriers fold down by the babies face so they can face forward easier
__label__pos	My son loves it and I couldn't get very much done without it!
__label__neg	Even my husband can't squirt about half the toys.
__label__neg	The suction is not strong enough.  
__label__neg	However,  the seat never supported her enough
__label__pos	 I got a lot more use out of the Baby Bjorn Sitter which is a little more money but my baby likes it, sits in it for at least 10 minutes (that is a lot for her
__label__neu	Dont know what was the hype all about. 
__label__neg	"""I washed it several times and even lint rolled it and it still didn't help."""
__label__neg	I had a hard time putting them up straight and keeping out the bubbles.
__label__neu	You can convert your bottles into sippy cups!!!
__label__neu	"2) The biggest problem - my daughters hair gets stuck around the ""pearl"" strand that clips into the holder piece to keep the bib on."
__label__neu	I put this diaper bag on my baby registry and someone bought it for the shower.
__label__neg	 I don't know why the hole is there, but all of the cups have this design flaw
__label__pos	I love these snack cups!
__label__neg	but this pillow doesn't help
__label__neu	I used these with the Evenflo glass bottles
__label__neu	Mozart plays bach, Bach plays Beethoven, Beethoven plays Mozart.
__label__neu	We started with the Playtex Nurser Bottles
__label__pos	My daughter still loves this mirror at 19 months old.
__label__neu	It is a big tub, so we have used it in the bathtub ever since his second bath on the kitchen counter when he peed on our toaster oven.  
__label__pos	All in all I think they were a great buy and worth it.
__label__pos	And after my son outgrows this as a crib toy, I can use it on a table in their room so they can still enjoy it.  
__label__neg	 I almost kept walking assuming it was something that the wheels ran over
__label__neu	Ditto to all the other reviews that say the gate is extremely difficult to install but it's worth it once it's in place -- it works very well
__label__neu	This bag is large and fit my my son's car seat, clothes and stroller for travel.  
__label__pos	I think it is so cute.
__label__neg	Good product,  but better ones out there for less money
__label__neg	 The reality is there are so many switches, settings, and keys on this thing that it's all but impossible for your child to learn cause and effect
__label__pos	My nephew has a Graco Contempo, which my daughter has used, and I like it much better because she sits up higher and the tray comes right to her at the appropriate height. 
__label__neg	 oh, and it's not portable. 
__label__neg	Also,  the belt clip is not tight - the monitor always falls off of my belt if I bend down to much
__label__neu	Even though the description said it takes an additional 2-3 days for processing, this was not the case. 
__label__neg	Overpriced is the least of the complaints I have about these.
__label__neu	Hoping that this would solve the problem I bought this item.
__label__pos	This toy has many thoughtful features -- no-slip texture, right-size for hands, light weight, soft (no banging on heads), friendly face and an engaging presence
__label__pos	I imagine this toy will remain one of my son's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor.
__label__neg	 It also only has one compartment to fit one very small bottle
__label__neg	The massage bubbles on the cup are uncomfortable and only irritate your breasts
__label__neg	It did take some maneuvering to set up because it is large and awkward when you unfold it.
__label__neu	Their policy is a 15% restocking charge,  even though they caused the problem,  but actually they've not refunded anything.
__label__neu	"""I had the idea that I would use this for the occasional pumping to get me started and then I would buy a hospital grade pump."""
__label__neu	"""I went to the store and found this monitor."""
__label__neu	After about the 10th time I nearly fell over the darn thing, I went to find a new gate and saw this one.
__label__pos	"""Lansinoh bags do hold more, but I don't find that to be an advantage (all I usually need is 5 oz at a time)."""
__label__neg	 My daughter loves to play and can spend hours knocking down block towers, chewing on books or rolling balls, but she is not impressed with taggies and neither are we
__label__neu	It divides me & my boyfriens up completely
__label__pos	It feels wonderful,  and I was pleasantly surprised
__label__neu	Then we would get to the car where the heat is on and she would be sweating.
__label__pos	There are also several little loopies that you can use linkadoos,  etc
__label__pos	An item I'm glad we bought
__label__neg	I bought this item in hopes that it would be comfortable for her and easy to use.
__label__neg	I bought this primarily because it takes regular trash bags we used it the way it's supposed to be used for the first couple of days but quickly discovered that as the pail gets full the dropping mechanism gets stuck forcing you to clean out the mechanism whenever it's time to change the pail and it's one more thing to wipe down if a diaper gets too messy.
__label__pos	"""It is nice to be able to grab it and go, and also to have all of my diaper changing things in one area."""
__label__neu	This way even if baby breaks out the arms go up above the swaddle and not below which would push the material upwards toward the face.
__label__neu	At our Newborn Essentials class before our child was born,  I asked the instructor if she had heard of the Woombie
__label__neu	"""This is the second one I bought."""
__label__pos	He has loved it ever since.
__label__pos	very soft bristles for my daughter who doesn't have much hair yet.
__label__neg	 However, it takes me about 20 minutes to pump 4 ounces
__label__neu	Make sure when you buy this product it comes with two of each of the adapter rings.
__label__pos	However, you can't even imagine the relief of having my son totally love this sippy cup FROM THE FIRST TRY!!!
__label__neg	 It does work to keep odor out I suppose, but so does a plastic bag. 
__label__pos	many others let out a drip or two when tipped over and such, but not these. 
__label__pos	"""Out of 3 that we bought, this is the most comfortable one."""
__label__neu	As long as your seat moves less than an inch in any direction AT THE BELT PATH (i.e. on an infant seat with a base, right at the seat crack where the other poster said it was tight) it is safe.  
__label__neu	It arrived without its template(parts A&B)and i decided not to install without them.
__label__neg	Unfortunately, the slip resistance is all but nonexistent. 
__label__neu	 He could hold his head well enough long before he was tall enough to face forward, but my baby didn't mind facing me
__label__neu	 In comparison, the Fisher Price 900mhz Long Range Monitor sounded excellent
__label__neu	My four month old isn't teething but is at the age where he's shoving everything into his mouth.
__label__neg	 I decided to return this car seat and the Venezia stroller to BRU when my baby was 8 weeks old
__label__neg	They bottles are sterile in the pack they come in, but once you open them, then what.
__label__pos	Well, now I know I would pay full price for them if I lost the ones I have.
__label__pos	Great product!
__label__neu	Be cautious with small babies but I'm sure is great with babies that are a little bigger where the velcro can be more secure.
__label__pos	This bouncy/toddler rocker is a good buy!
__label__neg	Now when I use it, the suction is not as strong or as efficient
__label__pos	She sits and stares at the world from the seat and it always puts her to sleep.
__label__pos	I don't have to worry about my 4 year old hurting him with this.
__label__neg	Like:  1) Removable handles, 2) BPA FreeDislike: 1) Ridiculously expensive, 2) Fidgety extra parts that do nothing except require cleaning and slow you down when you try to fill it.
__label__pos	No down side, all pluses here!
__label__neu	"Save your time and money,  I won't be surprised to hear this product is recalled in the near future...  For a better option try the ""snack trap"",  we used ours for 3 years not and no issues with the product breaking down."
__label__neg	She can't wear it for too long without getting overheated and fussy.
__label__pos	It's a full size booster seat so it is big.OTHER COMMENTS: It worked so well when we were abroad that now I keep this in the trunk of my car.
__label__neu	PLUS it's then much more sensitive to pick up sounds that will then set it off again.
__label__neg	"""We have reached out to the vendor and our next step is to reach out to the manufacturer to try to refund our purchase -- not interested in a replacement! -- but it's completely not worth the big price tag for such poor quality in our opinion."""
__label__neg	I tried it about 6 times and it only worked one time.  
__label__pos	This is a great transition for the swing stopping and can help baby sleep in it longer.
__label__neu	My son just grabs hold of the covers and off they come,  both knob and cover
__label__neu	Our rolling carry-on is old and did not feel stable enough with all that weight, so I just strapped on the car seat (Evenflo Triumph Advance Deluxe Convertible) and usually used my sling to carry my son.
__label__neg	 The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is my daughter seemed somewhat comfortable in it,  that it until she fell in between the positioners.
__label__neu	My daughted fit in it from the time she was born and we can still use it now at 7 months. 
__label__neu	It did not always stay on my nipple very well, but I may not have been putting it on correctly, I now realize.
__label__pos	My baby doesn't seem to mind cold wipes.I still use the organizer, though, and I like it.
__label__neg	It was a total waste of money
__label__pos	My baby was born in June and we used these every single day - for swadding at night, to place on the floor or sofa, to cover the bassinet from sunlight, to cover myself when nursing, etc.
__label__neu	"It never happened to me ever in my entire life though I'm complete ""backpack person"" and I never had anything else but a backpack."
__label__neg	With two children 16 months apart, I knew I'd need an installed gate for our ground floor
__label__pos	I like how the pacifier does not have hard parts,  minimizing the ring around the mouth,  and the nipple is round rather than odd shaped
__label__neg	Great concept, poor quality.
__label__neu	The opening is bigger than other potty chairs and oblong instead of round, so no more pooping on the seat.
__label__pos	It fits perfectly on my kitchen chair takes no extra room.
__label__pos	I would recommend this to anyone.
__label__pos	Best Bottles!
__label__pos	It works wonderfully.  
__label__pos	It doubled as a toy when he was in the car seat.
__label__neg	 
__label__pos	and the baby loves it!! 
__label__pos	"""I got smart with my second daughter and bought this."""
__label__neu	We never used the prop pillow.
__label__neu	The only problem with that is that the battery life in that monitor is only like 1-2 nights (tops!).
__label__neu	I added a detachable head support for the first several weeks because our baby's head kept falling to the side.2. 
__label__neu	I have to say there needs some improvement.
__label__pos	He smiles every time we hand her to him.
__label__neu	this ones only fit in doors!
__label__neu	Double bagging them helps to eliminate the orders.
__label__pos	I did a TON of research on car seats when my daughter started out growing her Graco ComfortSport Convertible CarSeat and found the Graco Nautilus to be one of the safest most comfortable affordable highest rated by consumers.
__label__neg	Not only was she gagging,  but she just didn't like the nipple
__label__pos	"""I would highly recommend this chair."""
__label__neu	I think it got damp and wasn't allowed to breathe because it cleared up within 48 hours after I stopped using them
__label__neg	Three diapers, a half empty bag of Kirkland wipes, one change of clothes, and an insulator pack for breast milk, prooved to be too much for the main compartment.
__label__neu	Most of the in- store models are cheaply built and expensive.
__label__neu	I opened the package and set them out to air for 3 weeks before giving them to the kids to put up in the baby's room.
__label__pos	"""And it is awesome."""
__label__pos	 I found the DEX bibs to be much better.
__label__neu	I'm going to have to use the infant carrier until she grows another inch or so.
__label__pos	The bright color seems to catch her eyes.
__label__pos	This product works great.
__label__neu	MUCH PREFER THE FRONT CARRIER
__label__pos	"""When we first got it (~5mo), our daughter loved to sit and play in it."""
__label__pos	Highly recommend.
__label__neu	Of course, we can't flush them. 
__label__pos	They came quickly from Amazon and they are very sturdy.  
__label__pos	It cost $30, which is more than the other tubs, but well worth the money.
__label__neg	i am a little worried that the changing top will not be strong enough to hold a baby for long
__label__pos	Considering the age of them I think that they've been a good value for us.
__label__pos	"""The motor (the purple ball-shaped section) died within the first three months, but when I called Tiny Love, the company that makes this, they sent a new one completely free of charge, and it continued to work well."""
__label__neu	We love the sounds although the Whale recording is a short loop and not as good as we had hoped.
__label__pos	I was pumping so much milk out by day 4 (after delivery) that our son is now 4 months old and we still have tons of frozen milk in the fridge. 
__label__neg	 Won't be ironing them when baby is here
__label__pos	"She holds onto his ""feathers"" and loves the noise the crinkle noise makes."
__label__neu	Because of her reflux,  I needed this to stand up to repeated washings.
__label__neu	We have the Saratoga P&amp;P and I've been very disappointed with the sheet we bought.
__label__neu	I think my child is too interested in the food to spend time wondering about the lid!
__label__neg	"The wipes at the bottom will dry out and turn brown within just a few days, and the insert for ""pop-up"" wipes won't stay down in the unit, so it just comes out with the wipes, making it impossible to grab a wipe with one hand."
__label__neu	It is very cute but he wont use it yet, we are still trying.
__label__pos	Plenty of room to hold all of the baby's bath stuff and great to use to sit on while giving the little one a bath.
__label__pos	"We got this bag for my husband so it looked ""cool"" for him.I used it on a trip with my infant and it was the best option."
__label__neg	I am just scared of the thing coming down on top of him because it is so heavy.
__label__pos	I am so happy I did.
__label__neu	"""he'd cry and cry."""
__label__neg	Fisher Price could stand to make the metal bar thicker.
__label__neu	All other objects come in for a good number of twists pulls and chews.
__label__neu	All you do is attach the liner to the breast pump, fill it up, and cap it and you can store it or feed right then.
__label__neu	Well,  I put it on my registry and got it,  and I wish I didn't!
__label__pos	"""He loves to touch and pat it all over, pulling and grabbing each part to make all the sounds."""
__label__neg	But otherwise give it a pass.
__label__pos	Following the instructions I was excited to have a revitalized hamper.
__label__neu	I got a sling from Hotslings instead.
__label__neu	I thought those were a little cheap and the plastic lids had turned a yucky color--they just looked dingy.  
__label__pos	I got this as a shower gift and I don't know what I'd do without it. 
__label__neg	 I had to put towels under it to absorb all the water
__label__neg	As soon as she began to roll around, about 4 months, I would wake in the night to screams...her litttle arms and legs would get caught in the spacing of the crib, up and over the bumper! 
__label__neg	 And the hefty price you have to pay for the replacement bags...what a rip-off! 
__label__neg	We have a bunch of the Born Free bottles and sippy cups
__label__pos	The front pouch easily lifts up to access more flat pockets.
__label__neg	 She got cold very quickly
__label__neg	It also stopped working altogether and this happened the same day it arrived.
__label__neu	I purchased this gate at Babies R Us, but read the reviews first from Amazon.  
__label__pos	The Safer Bather also dries very easily.
__label__pos	The adjustable length is better than I expected it to be - didn't think I'd adjust it as often as I do
__label__pos	"""She likes to look at the fish and bubbles while sitting in it."""
__label__neg	 Well, it shrank so bad that it no longer reaches the bottom of the legs so you can velcro it. 
__label__pos	"""\This seat is cheaper and more importantly, WAY more functional!"""
__label__pos	well,  it would be perfect if it worked
__label__neu	When trying to look at the screen when outside in sunlight,  the screen is completely black,  and nothing can be seen at all,  making it nothing but an audio monitor when the receiver is outside.
__label__pos	"""It keeps oder out really well until it starts to get full."""
__label__neg	We purchased this walker a few months before my daughter was born thinking that it was a good price so why pass it up
__label__neg	Normally I wouldn't care so much, but there was a VERY sharp piece of plastic left that we couldn't remove...
__label__neg	 In fact, the entire cover is already covered with frays and snags after only two weeks of use! 
__label__pos	 One reason I chose this brand/model is for its price
__label__neg	We ended up having to throw out the remainder of the milk and beg some napkins from a zoo snack stand attendant to sop up the mess.
__label__pos	It's definitely NOT too small, it's the perfect size for a toddlers small hands.
__label__neu	We've tried various brands that use all 3 methods
__label__pos	This is a great all purpose blanket.
__label__pos	What a great concept.
__label__pos	My 2 1/2 mo. old son can't grasp things yet but he really seems to like his Sophie.
__label__neu	I wish I would have found and purchased this sooner!
__label__pos	"""I decided to forgo the padded discs that you can screw into the wall to keep the gate in place, because I thought my daughter wouldn't be strong enough to dislodge it."""
__label__pos	"""It is expensive but it is worth the money."""
__label__pos	These bottles are really easy to clean.
__label__pos	The best thing i found about these toothbrushes are that they are not a straight long typical brush, because these bow out into an oval it makes it harder for a child to accidently swallow or push too far back into their mouths.
__label__pos	It is very simple to lift off the charger and put it back on.
__label__neg	 During the process of pumping, the valve that creates the suction would become loose and I would have to unscrew the bottle and press it back into place
__label__pos	"""At birth, it was the only the thing that my husband & I could do to give her space and relax her when she was fussy."""
__label__neg	 It didn't look like it would suppport her
__label__neu	"""The colorful little floating turtle can be turned on or off and gives a digital temperature readout."""
__label__neu	I can see why they thought this would be an innovative idea,  but in theory,  it just doesn't work.
__label__pos	"""Perhaps the biggest selling point for us was the fact that you have the option of using a plug-in adapter or batteries."""
__label__neg	If you can get another model that swings both ways, do that
__label__neu	I am so glad this didn't happen when my son was playing with it,  easy to choke on these pieces.
__label__neg	"The ""hands-free"" design is ridiculous--rubber bands with clips!"
__label__pos	I bought the Lamaze Spin & Explore for my daughtet, when it got to my home I opened it and set it up which was really easy
__label__neu	It does not come undone when the baby moves around.  
__label__pos	I'm not sure when we'd recline the seat but I guess it's a nice option to have.
__label__pos	I think this is a pretty new product and when I saw it at BRU it seemed like a good idea
__label__neu	This was something we certainly could have done without.
__label__neg	We used Avent bottles for several weeks, but our baby was spitting up _all the time_, seemed like she was choking during feedings, and had gas all the time
__label__neg	It was ok for awhile then things starting getting messy
__label__neg	I have tried to use this carrier a dozen times, but to no avail.
__label__pos	"""I can't seem to go wrong with this one."""
__label__pos	This bag is beautiful!
__label__pos	"""Less Pain"""
__label__pos	this booster seat has been a lifesaver, I use it with my 2.5 year old who likes to sit at his table with it and with his 7 month old brother as a first high chair.
__label__neg	We returned this carrier
__label__neu	Pros.
__label__neg	 Boy was I wrong
__label__neg	It's what I had for my first pregnancy.
__label__pos	We bought the Sound Sleeper and it was like magic!  
__label__pos	We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.
__label__pos	I find them really easy to clean and I have used these bottles with my now 20 month old twin boys (just without the natural nipples) The bottom piece is a godsend since I dont have to SCRUB to get the gunk out of the bottle!
__label__neg	however I just wish that it had held up a bit better for us
__label__neu	I finally just removed it and I use the toddler tub itself.  
__label__pos	"""My 18 month old cannot break this no matter how hard she tries."""
__label__neg	 The Avent nipples are TOO HARD for a breastfed baby
__label__pos	Easy to change bags.Stable when changing bags (others are not!!!)
__label__neg	 That didn't make sense to me at all
__label__neg	I use the Avent bottles to store milk, but I use the Medela bottles for feeding, which is kind of hassle compared to being able to pump directly into the feeding bottle.
__label__neu	I'd give up disposable diapers and the swing before I'd part with these
__label__neg	 False advertising and a waste of my time
__label__pos	Love that you can run everything over the small protable parental device. 
__label__neu	This design strikes me as a good idea but the execution is ridiculously bad.
__label__pos	"""I have one in each bathroom and she can go use it, lift up the lid, take the ""cup"" and pour it in the potty and then return it to the chair."""
__label__pos	"""It's too complicated of a mechanism for kids to figure out (not that they'd be able to reach it...), but easy for parents to use & can be done with one hand."""
__label__neg	 Don't waste your money...
__label__neu	Now he sits up and plays with the toys that hang from the gym.
__label__pos	"""Don't be scared by other reviews saying it's complicated to use because it's not."""
__label__neu	bottle in 10-15 min.
__label__neu	Which is sort of irrelevant to the tub, but highlights the dangers (an hilarity) of a bath in the kitchen.
__label__pos	I bought 2 packs of 4 and used them constantly.
__label__pos	Easy to use.
__label__neg	I do get interference every once in a while.  
__label__pos	The bag is a cinch to dispose of, and I LOVE how you can cut it off at any point you want.  
__label__pos	I highly recommend this product for all parent who have dogs in their house no matter what size they are.
__label__neg	 I wouldn't buy this product again
__label__neg	 I still see them sold in older packaging at drugstores and at Target
__label__pos	Now that he's 5 months old he and his Sophie the Giraffe are all but inseparable.  
__label__pos	"""Then Avent came out with these!"""
__label__neg	 I had to keep pulling the bottle away from my hungry baby to allow air in bottle
__label__neg	 We are much happier now and our daughter is too
__label__neg	I feel like my life revolves around washing, drying and assembling bottles.
__label__pos	No matter which one you end up choosing be sure to get a playmat.
__label__neu	***Third,  the sprayer screws directly into your supply line and it is very,  very easy to accidentally loosen the connection (just by turning the thing off) and end up with a leak that could cause water damage or a minor flood.
__label__neu	Many inflatable items have a closed valve so when you try and blow up the item you have to pinch the stem at the same time.
__label__neu	I DON'T HAVE TO STRUGGLE TO GET THE SNOWSUIT ON MY NEWBORN
__label__neu	The lid is definately tight, but it does not bother me much. 
__label__neu	Well I decided to go Avent and here I am writing a review for a playtex sippy cup.
__label__neg	The motor broke twice and one time it suctioned in and never released
__label__pos	this is a great buy.
__label__pos	Now that she is a little older and can wiggle out of the blanket swaddle, it's great because it has velcro closures so it keeps her snog all night and I don't have to worry about her wiggling free and having loose blankets in the crib with her.
__label__neu	For those worrying about the quilted quality of the sheets and baby's safety, I use a sleep positioner for peace of mind.
__label__neu	Had a little difficulty reclining or lifting the back with her in it as have to push both buttons at same time as moving the back but was not that big of an issue
__label__neg	 Within the first month of use the hand-held audio only monitor broke
__label__pos	They hold up very well in the wash and fit great over my Simmons mattress.
__label__pos	"My husband is 6'4 and big and he can make this work for him to take ""piggy"" out for a walk."
__label__neu	"""I got two of these from someone who's twin granddaughters never used them."""
__label__pos	"""she loves it."""
__label__neg	My baby does not seem to like the NoJo very much and I prefer the Bjorn in almost all aspects.
__label__neu	Babies are also not supposed to sleep with a blanket on top of them,  so we have yet to use the comforter.
__label__pos	"""They wash great and kep baby very comfortable whilemaking it easy for night time changes."""
__label__pos	It's actually pretty funny since it is not obvious what is amusing about this process but somehow he reacts as though you're about to attack him with tickles.
__label__neu	If you can get both, do it.
__label__pos	The music is gorgeous, by the way.
__label__neu	They come in a range of colors,  I am sure everyone can find at least one color they like
__label__neg	I had no luck with this product,  either,  and there were more parts to clean with this feeding system
__label__neu	"""We have a 14 mo."""
__label__pos	In woombie she can stretch and move around her arms and legs more.
__label__pos	 This pillow is fantastic. 
__label__neu	I stored all of her bath things under the bed with blankets, onesies, and burp cloths. 
__label__pos	"""I could even hear her roll over."""
__label__neg	The only down fall of this monitor is that the lights do light up my room quite a bit, since we use a noise machine in the kids rooms.
__label__pos	My daughter sometimes prefers to sleep in it rather than anything else. 
__label__neg	 Now he twists and turns and won't stay put in the tub. 
__label__neg	But not Evenflo.
__label__neg	I just bought this toy because it was the only one I could find in the store for a stroller.. 
__label__pos	"""4)  Configures to all kinds of angles, so you can fit it where you need it"""
__label__pos	 Generally I LOVE the manhatten toy company
__label__neg	He couldn't care less about the light, which is motion activated.
__label__neu	MY FOUR YEARS OLD SON LIKES TO SHAKE IT TOO.THEY ARE NOT LOUD AND MAKES INTERESTING SOUNDS.
__label__pos	It's so cute.
__label__neg	 I can't get them to stay in place and they are really akward
__label__pos	I love how soft and cuddly this changing pad cover is
__label__pos	"""I do love the price and the fact that you can fasten it into a carseat."""
__label__neg	It was highly recommended by the hospital,  so I bought TWO sets of these bottles before my baby was born.
__label__pos	She was entertained by the music which was a great incentive for her to stay a little longer on the potty, and when she was ready it transfers and snaps onto the &quot;big girl potty&quot; and still plays music!
__label__pos	First of all, I thought the steering wheel was cute. 
__label__neg	Wayyyy over priced! 
__label__pos	"""These are also great to throw in the diaper bag, because they are small."""
__label__neg	"""The speed of the swing is absurd."""
__label__neu	He can take it all over the house and I don't have to go behind him with the vacuum. 
__label__pos	I also appreciate how many colors it comes in
__label__pos	"""My daughter seems to like it."""
__label__neg	Don't bother with this one
__label__neu	 NOooooo
__label__pos	Great, but watch your kiddo
__label__pos	I would recommend this to any parent!
__label__pos	Grandbaby approved
__label__pos	"""My son loves it."""
__label__neg	 The prong that connects to the handle, which creates the vacuum to pull the milk out, consistently becomes unlatched breaking the vacuum so you have to fix it and start all over
__label__neu	Just pour whatever amount of water in it tells you, drop your bottle in and press the button.
__label__neu	its gently used and well they liked it in there apartment but he out grew it to quicky!
__label__pos	Highly recommend.
__label__pos	This is a great carrier once you figure it out.
__label__neu	It was awkward and difficult to use.
__label__neg	:) Since I was really impressed with the idea of a washable hamper at the time of purchase we will not be buying one for Baby #2 when the time comes.
__label__neg	I couldnt tell when the bottle was ready and the light would go on and off and not warm the bottle or else get it to hot
__label__pos	The bottles worked great for the first six months and then.....
__label__neu	I'll be returning this back to Amazon
__label__pos	"""I like that it can be pushed right up to the table, with the base fitting underneath the table."""
__label__neu	it's been about 16 weeks since we got it and we have never had one problem with it
__label__pos	"""She sucked the fruit right out and screamed for more."""
__label__pos	My son loved being in it as well.
__label__neu	I had to switch to bottles because of low milk production and having to supplement soon after my son was born. 
__label__neu	With our next child,  I will definitely be buying electric
__label__neg	She was resistant to this at first, and I had to carefully put it on after she was asleep. 
__label__neu	this was a big waste of money.
__label__neg	"The ""new"" design still needs lots of improvement!"
__label__neg	I gave it two stars because it was easy to set up and it positions nicely--just didn't work out for us.
__label__neg	 I looked everywhere for the older version and found it
__label__pos	"""I would cringe when I would see her gnawing on the rail."""
__label__pos	Honestly, if I wanted to just store bottles, I would have bought something else!
__label__neu	If you get into a routine.
__label__neg	The stationary 'jump' setting is also a joke; we own a FP Jumperoo and when we put my son in here to jump, I kid you not, he looked at us like 'you have got to be kidding me.' Given all these factors, I think there are much better walkers/activity centers on the market-- buy something else. 
__label__pos	It is so easy to put on.
__label__pos	However as a nursing pillow this is your best choice.
__label__pos	We use racket balls with the toy now and my 6 month old does enjoy the activity.
__label__pos	I keep telling people that this chair is one of the few things I did right the first time.
__label__neu	You can find generic liners that work and fit just as well, to cut back on cost.
__label__neg	"""I wish I'd done a little more research when looking for a bouncer (why this even comes up in a search for bouncers is beyond me..."""
__label__pos	My son really enjoyed it.
__label__neg	 (he is almost 3 yr old) He does fit on this potty, but it leaves horrible red marks in his inner thighs after only sitting on it a few minutes
__label__pos	A great toy all around!
__label__pos	Now I have this swing next to my bed and he sleeps in this swing every night.
__label__pos	I am very happy with this crib.
__label__neg	the second one was also damaged.
__label__neu	She instantly responded to the Playtex nipples,  however.
__label__neu	It didnt seem to fit together right.
__label__pos	i've been using the pillow for about a month now, and would HIGHLY recommend this pillow for expecting mothers.
__label__neu	I bought this for my son's baby car seat because I would find him with his head bobbed to the side when I checked on him.
__label__pos	We loved this product.
__label__neg	 I'd rather error on the side of safety.
__label__pos	Our son is three months old, and still loves it.
__label__pos	I was wrong, she loves it.
__label__neu	maybe it wasn't there
__label__neg	I cut the rest up to use as cloth diaper wipes.
__label__neg	Cons:Can't dry them in dryer: (But who's gonna separate 30+ small wipes before drying, and risk missing one and ruining it! 
__label__pos	My first daughter likes these and was bottled fed only.
__label__neu	I know I will be using these for a LONG time.
__label__neg	 It was a complete waste of money! 
__label__neu	 The paperwork included with the cover even instructs you not to rely on the cover for warmth and to dress your baby for the weather
__label__neg	Even the new and improved Diaper Genie can't compare to the Diaper Champ.
__label__neu	Needless to say, I returned it to Babies R Us.  
__label__neu	"""You can ask my husband - I've purchased at LEAST 5 potty seats since getting our son to use the potty."""
__label__neg	My son is only 10 months old and can't use this seat because there's not enough space between the seat and the tray
__label__neu	My baby loves playing without shoes or socks on
__label__neg	Once solid foods were introduced into my son's diet, this didn't even come close to holding in the stench.
__label__neu	Now I have minimal clean up and I only have to sterilize the nipples, rings and tops!!! 
__label__pos	My son was born weighing about 5.5 pounds so we put a neck supports in the swing he seemed to love it lulled him to sleep and the swing is easy to store. 
__label__pos	It is a great buy, I'm so glad we found it.
__label__neg	The biggest problem I noticed was that they leaked after I had them in the cooler if we went out.
__label__neu	I have not noticed a difference with A&D on my cloth diapers.
__label__pos	It came out beautiful!
__label__neg	 She is not a big girl but this seat is just too uncomfortable for her. 
__label__pos	I also like the ability to use the batteries and put it on your belt. 
__label__pos	I think my son will kill me later in life for writing this BUT the handles really helped him with going #2
__label__neg	She destructed one every 2 weeks.
__label__pos	Way better than any of the cheap terry ones marketed for babies.
__label__neg	I didn't like this blanket really at all. 
__label__neg	 Luckily, I stopped to see what it was
__label__neu	You can buy extra sets of hardware to move the gate around depending on the circumstances.4.
__label__pos	Now our son is able to watch it spin for a much longer time and he prefers the ocean aquarium music anyway.
__label__pos	"""Within days, he was spitting up less and had less gas too."""
__label__neu	I tried to vary the amount of water I poured into the heating base but this didn't help.
__label__neg	 Buy the Avent instead its has a great sensitivity function for only slightly more money.
__label__neu	).
__label__neu	I bought this product based on the reviews I read about a year ago.
__label__pos	This monitor is excellent!
__label__pos	She is over 6 months now, so she doesn't play with it as much, but it always brings a smile when we bring it out!
__label__pos	It was just a great chair. 
__label__neg	 The monitor is very large, though, and so it would have been nice if the hand held auido one worked - so I could take it to another room
__label__neu	This train makes a rattle sound when his wheels are moving.
__label__pos	No mess no smell.
__label__pos	Now, at 4 months, the star is his all time favorite.
__label__neu	 My son liked it, but it's not a fail proof soother for breastfed babies in the beginning
__label__pos	I love my inclined to sleep.
__label__pos	"""Can also be used to help prop baby up when they begin to learn to sit or for them to lay in when they are little."""
__label__neu	I just washed it every so often and kept it in my car for next time.
__label__neg	I got this toy for my son to crawl after but it's the lamest toy ever
__label__neu	It will also last you a long time so you won't need another tub later when your little one is getting to big for an infant tub.
__label__neg	 She know that the door doesn't close and falls apart, so she's always where the plastic bag is. 
__label__neg	 Well, when it finally came time to open up the box, the music didn't work
__label__neu	"""I have used the Original Diaper Genie and the Diaper Dekor."""
__label__neg	Bottom line: If you like the idea of soothing sounds, don't buy this product
__label__neg	Just use a pillowcase & it works just as well...
__label__neu	I breastfed and formula fed my baby for the first 5 weeks. 
__label__neu	I tried using this pump for about 2 days till I got too frustrated to try anymore.
__label__neg	It is expensive and it takes too long to heat a bottle
__label__pos	Probably not the best analogy, but I'm really glad I have the soother.
__label__pos	"""He loved it and I'd have to restart it for him over and over (with or without the remote) because it captured his interest so well."""
__label__neg	However,  good luck getting it to stay!
__label__neg	The adhesive wouldn't restick either. 
__label__pos	"""I'm so glad that I did, I use this constantly and ended up buying 2 more."""
__label__pos	I highly recommend this cup for any mom or grandmom that is on the go or even just relaxing at home. 
__label__neu	My baby was born 8 lbs 2 oz and was 10 lbs at 4 weeks. 
__label__neg	This product is poorly designed.
__label__pos	This swing has helped me get through a lot.
__label__neg	I haven't used it again after the first time.
__label__pos	They even have variable flow nipples so you don't have to buy three sets.
__label__pos	All in all this was a good choice for us!
__label__neg	50 a pair and they last only a month or two before they need to be replaced (The holes enlarge and let too much flow out) There are MUCH CHEAPER and simpler / better designed bottles out there - you just have to look
__label__neu	This system works great but is so bulky on my newborn.
__label__neu	I ended up buying the Radian XT.
__label__neu	Others complain this isn't very bouncy -- and they're right -- but this isn't a bouncer
__label__neu	You can't input a time, they are just timers.
__label__neu	It has a detachable base which, when installed in the rear-facing position, fully fills in the gap between the carseat and seat back.  
__label__pos	My mom bought one for her house and after I saw how much my son liked it I immediately went out and bought one for myself.
__label__neu	It is a little more expensive that other mattress pads but in my opinion it is worth it.
__label__neg	 Or just do what I did and make sure your child knows how to properly wash his/her hands after using the restroom
__label__neg	 Surely no one would design a unit to be placed a yard from a sleeping child in a dark room with a big flashing green light on the front of it
__label__neu	"The SwaddleMe (which was the only way to swaddle our little Houdini) and the white noise CD ""For Crying Out Loud"
__label__pos	less $$ and easy to use.
__label__neu	In London I use the Widgey pillow and so I thought this was similar.
__label__neg	 It also seems that when it is in correctly, occasionally it creates some sort of seal or pressure, and the formula won't come out of the bottle at all
__label__pos	The little pockets on the side are handy for a tube of diaper rash ointment, etc.
__label__neu	Also, the nipple on the wide neck is different from standard, and it takes baby a few feedings with the new nipple to get used to it. 
__label__pos	You literally can put your baby in the carrier, attach the cover and go. 
__label__neu	Be wary of any diaper pail that requires instructions and a demo by your next-door-neighbor in order to use it!
__label__neu	I was so frustrated with trying to put Snoogle's cover back on after washing that I left it off and left the pillow bare.
__label__neg	However, it just doesn't match up to the Moby.
__label__pos	I loved this product at first and I know my daughter enjoyed it for the first two months
__label__neu	"""We keep the water running throughout the bath and rely on the colored light scheme for temperature control."""
__label__neu	Well,  the top weighs a ton when there's a sleeping baby in it,  so I didn't even try to lift it as I was recovering from my c-section.
__label__pos	I told her it was her special bib and how special she was to wear it!
__label__neu	It worked great for about 8 weeks,  then one of the front wheels bent to where we couldn't use it anymore.
__label__pos	All of the pieces I've tried so far work very well also.
__label__neu	When our son started escaping from the receiving blankets we'd swaddle him in, we started using a sleep sack.
__label__neu	If I was sitting in my bed reading, I'd lay her next to me on her noggin nest for a nap.
__label__pos	"""I LOVE this product."""
__label__pos	"""if your little one is like ours, he/she will find it extremely amusing to pull up and roll the mat."""
__label__pos	Don't hessitate on this one you won't be dissapointed!
__label__neg	This step-up is a danger.
__label__neu	I use plastic links to connect from one loop to the next, then attach toys to the links, so she has a little chain of toys that can't get too far out of her grasp.  
__label__neu	Apparently I can handle a ziploc baggie but not a twist tie
__label__neu	Keep a few handy in the nursery and use them to bag the poopy diapers.
__label__neu	Sometimes he tires himself out jumping, and falls asleep in it...
__label__neu	I don't understand the problem in some of the other reviews that the footrest comes unsnapped...
__label__neu	There were a few saucers that really didn't hold her attention at all.  
__label__neg	In the past I rated a diaper pail that required expensive refills.
__label__neg	The placement of the music and vibrate buttons is where her legs are though so it will cycle on and off as her feet kick the buttons on and off.
__label__pos	"""It is very comfortable to carry too."""
__label__pos	CHOOSE THIS SHEET for your child's crib.
__label__neg	"""I felt like he was about to fall out all the time."""
__label__pos	All baby bottle supplies fit fine with no issues.
__label__neg	On top of the fact that we had 20 bottles and only 2-3 nipples that worked the way they were supposed to.
__label__neu	Our son slept in the papasan for the first 2 months
__label__neu	I have researched every gate on the market at this point.
__label__neg	The wipes dry out quickly or are too soggy, there was no in between.
__label__neu	Warm water in the microwave and stick the bottle in that... 
__label__pos	I love the different sounds it makes and my baby loves watching the fish.
__label__neg	I would only have 2-3 diapers in there when it begins to smell.
__label__neu	"""My son weighs 16 lbs and has plenty of room to grow in this seat!"""
__label__neg	I found the nipples EXTREMELY hard for a new born baby to suck on
__label__pos	I also love the idea of wrapping him on because it seems more organic and natural.
__label__pos	He is 21 months old and still loves looking at the stars.
__label__pos	It is so simple to use and my baby always falls asleep in it (she's 6 weeks old).
__label__pos	Icouldn't have nrsed without it.
__label__neu	You can also switch it to battery power if you want to take it outside or something. 
__label__neg	My daughter was small, but this really seemed very cumbersome to use. 
__label__neu	So,  I rarely use it and even though I rarely use it,  the motor all of a sudden started making a loud disturbing noise that wakes my baby anyways.
__label__pos	They are lively and bright little spoons and much shorter than his others so they make a great decoration.
__label__neg	 Avent bottles are awsome too
__label__pos	My 6 month old loves his cars!
__label__neg	You think they are on tight,  then when you hold them up at eye level you will often find that they are on crooked
__label__neg	Decent size cubby to hold toys in the bath, but one side doesn't seem to want to stick to the walls
__label__neg	I got it so that my daughters head would not fall forward while she was sleeping in her car seat but the part that goes behind her head is so bulky that it actually pushes her head forward.
__label__neg	Bulky bulky bulky.
__label__pos	My three-month old loves it.
__label__neg	 I aired it out for 2 weeks (
__label__neu	We set it on his dresser.
__label__neg	The music was loud and painful. 
__label__pos	I can't recommend this toy enough! 
__label__neu	 I am thankful that nothing happened to her when she sild down the pillow
__label__neg	But the bottles routinely leaked, ruining several diaper bags, clothing, and nighttime feedings
__label__neu	"""As I see it, it's during the 1st."""
__label__neu	I'd send it back,  but it would cost more to ship it than I paid for it in the first place
__label__neu	It is impossible to get folded and unfolded.
__label__pos	But we do really like it as a wearable blanket
__label__neg	 Not to mention that to two measley suction cups that are suppose to hold it onto the side of the tub do not work at all. 
__label__pos	"""What more can you ask for?"""
__label__pos	Holding up well after several months of daily use; looks brand-new. 
__label__neg	I haven't had any of the mechanical problems that others have mentioned, but have noticed that sometimes if the mobile doesn't want to move, I just need to adjust it by moving the mobile unit in the stand (that attaches to the crib rail) just a little to the left or right.  
__label__neu	Infant Carseat-Graco Snugride
__label__neg	The formation of the seat is very squished and I don't know why.
__label__neg	You have to put the thing directly into an infant's crib (making the cord a choking hazard) in order for them to even hear it
__label__pos	Wonderful bottle for breast or bottle fed babies.
__label__neg	Buy a different brand
__label__neg	As an ophthalmologist, I can attest to the functional utility of this product
__label__neg	I get frustrated and put it away and pull it out again like a month later and try again, but get the same reading, 77 degrees when I know it's a good 50 degrees outside & our air unit was off.
__label__neg	I was offended at the sight of this toy at first.
__label__pos	Would definitely recommend!
__label__pos	It's completely worth it and I wish I'd had it since he started solids.
__label__neg	 It doesn't beep so you dont know wen its done. 
__label__neu	"""Here's what happened: My husband was flipping it over to determine which was the more firm side, when he noticed a long, loose thread."""
__label__neu	He also slips down the sling frequently.
__label__pos	We are considering buying one for the babysitter and even the friend who occasinally picks up baby from daycare.
__label__neg	I bought these spouts based on great reviews but got extremely disappointed when I start using them
__label__neu	edit).
__label__pos	The liquid flows so easily and the baby does not have to suck so hard- I highly recommend even if you don't have a fussy baby because they seem to work the way a bottle should.
__label__neg	"""We had this product less than a year before we switched to the diaper champ."""
__label__pos	I like that I can remove the tray insert and still have a usable surface.
__label__neu	Usually we change the bag about once a week,  every garbage day so no dirty diapers are sitting in there for longer than a week
__label__neu	I am a certified child passenger safety technician and this is NOT a safety concern.  
__label__pos	This crib set is so wonderful!
__label__neg	all you have to do is get a piece of flannel and hem it and make the corners, they don't need elastic since the mattress has bending points in it
__label__neu	Think of nightime feeding
__label__neg	Very frustrating!
__label__neg	 The rest of the frame is pine
__label__neg	 Needless to say, we returned it
__label__pos	We highly recommend this tub as it is durable and fun!
__label__neu	They all look the same other than the color variation which has nothing to do with the sounds
__label__pos	I liked that this pillow grows with your baby and will be good at helping an older baby sit in the bath better making bath time more enjoyable.
__label__neu	He is in the range for length that's noted for this sleep sack. 
__label__pos	"""Stors easy and it has a SHOWER!"""
__label__neg	Why spend a longer amount of time pumping that you have to (and yes it does take longer even though the manual says their stats say otherwise
__label__pos	He likes hearing the sand/rattle sound when I turn it over for him.
__label__pos	The music is clear.  
__label__neg	My daughter is only 8 months and can understand the concept of a cup but this one eludes her.
__label__neu	"This means you can't ""top off"" a bottle,  or add something to an already made bottle."
__label__pos	I love the entire Foogo line.  
__label__neu	Save yourself the headache.
__label__neg	 I will be uploading them into amazon's product picture page, we'll see if it's approved
__label__pos	The bright colors and various textures are awesome!  
__label__pos	He's so quiet sometimes that I forget he's in there.
__label__neu	Wish the handles were adjustable- they needed to be an extra 3-4 inches higher.
__label__neg	It seemed like every nipple had some sort of problem.
__label__neg	 We tried this monitor in 3 different areas of the US, and static everywhere
__label__pos	A friend of mine suggested this tub because of the &quot hammock feature.&quot  Your baby is cradled in a &quot hammock&quot  that attaches to the tub, making it super easy to bathe your newborn.
__label__neg	 at 20 minutes at a time
__label__pos	This one seemed to get good marks . 
__label__neg	You're supposed to be able to fold it up, but I haven't figured it out yet.
__label__pos	my son was 5lb7oz and it was perfect
__label__pos	It allows her to turn it on by herself,  which is nice since she like to be independent.
__label__neg	The only problem I had was that my skin broke out where the rubber rested against it
__label__pos	"""I still love the Kooshies."""
__label__neg	 these are nothing like the beads that are for regular play which are a harder plastic and its easy for a baby to figure out which part goes into which
__label__neu	We have it for our 7 month old son who was crawling all over the place.
__label__neu	Yes, yes, I read Karp's Happiest Baby on the Block, and yes, I believe that swaddling itself is the miracle-not this blanket.
__label__neu	This toy gets my son's attention.
__label__neu	My son's room always smells like you know what.
__label__neg	They are so gauzy that you can see through them, so they won't even work for a game of
__label__pos	We have been using it for a little over 8 months now and it has started to smell a little (that's why not 5 stars),  I did clean it up with bleach and let it sit outside to air out and now it is much improved
__label__neg	 I really didn't like using them with the twist ties
__label__neg	Furthermore, the blue lights are not that great (although better than the amber ones).
__label__pos	I highly recommend this plug cover!
__label__pos	1) Removable handles,  2) BPA FreeDislike
__label__neg	However upon using these bottles I became increasingly frustrated with leaking issues.
__label__neu	"""We got sick of that, so decided to be a little more spendy and try these."""
__label__neg	The ties on one of mine broke as I was trying to tie the bow.  
__label__neg	 once you get it under the chair, you can't scoot the chair up to the table. 
__label__pos	It's so cheap!
__label__pos	The only thing is that it fit my bassinet pad just a little loose, other than that this is a great product.
__label__pos	Overall great carrier!
__label__neg	"""I then ran out and got the Munchkin Tri-flow."""
__label__neu	At first I thought a refridgerator had been delivered!
__label__pos	I guess this is an OK choice
__label__pos	 I also purchased a stand alone jumper and feel that it was a little more appropriate and money better spent
__label__neu	"i got stuck once at a conference because I forgot my cones for my pump,  so i set out to create an ""emergency"" stock of cones for the pump and car"
__label__neg	I didnt purchcase my cups from Amazon but since I am looking for replacement cups...I thought I should leave a message.
__label__neg	 I don't have that, so we only really use it for the sound
__label__neu	I followed the instructions on how to wash the sheet,  yet the backing still came apart and the whole thing shrank so it doesn't fit the mattress right and makes it bunch up.
__label__pos	It so easy to use and fast.
__label__pos	It was a great value for the money in our opinion.
__label__neu	 Why not make them a couple of inches deeper so they can hold more
__label__neg	Same goes for the ones with the flippy lid thing.
__label__neg	 With him in it I couldn't even put two fingers between him and the carrier
__label__neg	It should have been made with elastic and shirring.
__label__neg	 And within 3 months, they began to leak
__label__neg	Once you get your child into a reasonably predictable routine,  you can warm bottles at a reasonable time and easily without having to waste time and money on the First Years Quick Serve Bottle Warmer
__label__neg	The Ever-Fresh pad at the bottom does dry out, but we just re-wet it each time we replace the wipes.
__label__pos	"""Does what it says."""
__label__neu	"""I don't have a dish washer so I guess it makes sure your bottles are sterlized properly, but if you use really hot water and give it a good wash then you wouldn't really need to go this extra step."""
__label__neu	As a first-time mom to a now 6 month old boy, I have run the gamut in terms of baby toys.
__label__pos	"""It provides the support they need, while allowing for some independence."""
__label__neu	There was just enough pressure on his little belly to turn it into a projectile mess.
__label__pos	All the pieces come off and are easy to put back on for cleaning.
__label__pos	Highly recommended.
__label__pos	It fits easily into my diaper bag, it's lightweight enough that my baby and I don't swelter in the heat, it's wide enough to cover all of me, and I love that I can see my baby while I'm feeding her.
__label__neg	They are so thin and cheap
__label__neu	I figured it was just for feeding.
__label__neg	There has to be a better hand pump out there. 
__label__neu	My baby hates them for feeding,  however.
__label__neu	We did get a lot of use out of it though before that.
__label__pos	Was especially great those first couple months during the night feedings.
__label__pos	Plastic is very good.
__label__pos	It's very easy to use and you can use whatever trash bag you want.
__label__pos	"""what a waste of space!"""
__label__pos	It fall down from a high chair so many times and its fine!
__label__pos	It's especially helpful since she has reflux, because it keeps her propped up at an angle.On a side note, she loves the aquarium crib soother too.
__label__neg	HateThey were hard to screw on (the flat tops to the bottoms and many times were on crooked
__label__neg	This is one of the more expensive changing pads so you would expect it to be more durable. 
__label__pos	Light and breathable, but yet substantial.
__label__pos	just what i wanted
__label__pos	The Baby Bjorn takes care of all the problems I had with the Safety 1st potty.
__label__neg	The way baby is positioned in this carrier causes spinal compression. 
__label__neu	Superman had Kryptonite and my baby has swings.
__label__neu	He is on the tall size and he quickly outgrew his other rocker (Fisher Price Rainforest Rocker).
__label__neu	After using both these bags and the Gerber bags,  I prefer the zipper-style closure of the Gerber bags.
__label__pos	"""Buy this one!"""
__label__pos	Looks good, and easy to manuever with one hand
__label__pos	Great Sterelizer!!!
__label__pos	Also works for appliances or other surfaces that you can't drill into.2)  Easy open (for adults).
__label__neu	"""Choose a monitor that operates in a different frequency band than your cordless phone."""
__label__pos	"""Lansinoh claims ""can store flat,"" but so can the Medela bags."""
__label__neg	Boy was I wrong.
__label__pos	"""I looked at other car seat covers but none came even close to this one."""
__label__pos	The Ergo baby carrier saves your back and supports more weight over the long run.
__label__neg	 Unfortunately i have a Mountaineer and this car seat just does not fit comfortably anywhere in the back seat in the rear facing position
__label__pos	My son likes to look at it,  but it has WAY TOO SHORT of a song and spin cycle.
__label__pos	My son loves these cups, they feel clean and it's BPA free!
__label__neg	But after only a few uses the mesh cup/bottle holders have torn
__label__pos	I think it's also a great way to build leg strength.  
__label__neu	I started bottle feeding at 6 months and ended up having to switch and buy an entire new line.
__label__neg	Yuck.
__label__neu	 Maybe it will be more helpful as he is older and we don't need the hammock.
__label__pos	I liked the sling.
__label__neu	I bought 2 as I figured he'd be likely to soil it in the night and since everyone said it was such a miracle I didn't want to be without
__label__neg	 The first two did not function properly, they would not swing side to side
__label__pos	 i went back to avent and he did fine switching back and forth.
__label__neu	This difference is that the lights turn off in about 15 minutes under the battery and stay on constantly under the a/c. 
__label__neg	I tried the Dr
__label__pos	It made nursing so much easier
__label__pos	Fabulously Affordable
__label__neu	The Ventaires didn't fit well on dryer adn would wiggle all around and fall off if it was jiggled in the least.
__label__pos	"""Since he loved this mobile so much, I tried another mobile."""
__label__neg	 She isn't quite big enough to make it go all by herself so she just sits and plays in it while I'm cooking in the kitchen with a little stool underneath her feet
__label__neg	The baby sling never stayed in place and i was constantly adjusting the sling and baby
__label__neg	It does some,  but not worth the money to my opinion
__label__pos	A MUST have!
__label__neg	 I originally gave it 4 stars, taking one off because it's bulky and makes it difficult to roll over
__label__neu	2
__label__neg	We finally ended up with the Playtex Premium.
__label__neg	I bought this tub because it received really good reviews - but it is gigantic and really takes up half of my bathroom.
__label__neg	 Please, do not buy this product.
__label__pos	These dishwasher baskets are designed allot better. 
__label__pos	I was skeptical about the price, but it's totally worth it if you want to be able to use a pump on a regular basis.
__label__neg	"""Out of depseration, we took the genie to the local baby store and after 45 minutes even the staff could not figure this product out."""
__label__pos	This fit well in our room, washed well ( leakydiapers and spitup), secured to the bed and holds so much! 
__label__neu	We don't use this anymore because my daughter is a toddler but we used it since the day my daughter was born and we brought her home from the hospital.
__label__neg	I wouldn't recommend this to anyone
__label__pos	"""My husband set it up and it was adorable."""
__label__neg	Or you can buy Evenflo bottles without the nipples for $4.
__label__neg	 I'm no longer using these because I've switched to cloth diapers
__label__neg	I do NOT understand why anyone likes the Boppy for nursing.
__label__pos	My 3 month old loves the water, and seems to feel very secure in the mesh cradle included.
__label__neg	"""That makes more sense to me."""
__label__neg	The clip is unnecessarily bulky, as is the part that attaches to the binky.
__label__pos	I contacted Sassy,  and after apologizing,  they assured me that it was only distilled water inside and that they don't use anything harmful in their products
__label__pos	"""It helped keep him propped up, so that he wasn't lying down flat."""
__label__neg	 This tub's blue circle looks like it would prevent slipping, but it isn't all that effective
__label__neu	I am not a fat woman,  but when I've just given birth to a baby,  I'm not a SKINNY woman,  either
__label__neg	In my case, only 2 months after use the sterilizer,the system not run properly and I had to buy a new 
__label__pos	It is the best one I have found
__label__neu	Even when I screw the top on without the handles,  it leaks.
__label__neg	I think there is one spot that will play a little bit of music when you squeeze it, but that's about it.
__label__neu	It's hit or miss but I don't regret trying.
__label__pos	Summary:  Great Forward facing infant seat!
__label__pos	I highly recommend Sophie-- our son loves her!
__label__neg	How far from the truth this is for us. 
__label__neg	 All you hear is static
__label__pos	"It is just a very nice,  comfortable ""situation"" for your baby and for your piece of mind"
__label__pos	It was very easy to put together and is so multi- functional.
__label__neg	What can I say.
__label__neg	I wish that there were more lights, along the sides, top, etc.
__label__neg	What a waste. 
__label__neg	But I am basically using it as just a glorified wipe box because it's too much of a pain to do the warming part.
__label__neg	 He prefers to be IN the warm water rather than on top of it
__label__pos	The only real drawbacks are that it doesn't have any way to secure it to the changing table without the diaper depot... and it is a bit bulky.
__label__neg	 The packaging claims that they are super absorbant and they just aren't
__label__neg	 However, this item only has one selector so all you get is the music
__label__neu	there is a plastic ring around the refill that sticks out
__label__pos	With a child with severe anxiety, being alone and sleeping issues, the Two way intercom communication has been a blessing. 
__label__pos	the pictures of cats and dogs make it even more appealing and it gets the job done,  is easy to clean,  etc
__label__neg	"""I waited, and it was quite an ordeal."""
__label__neg	We don't bother to open or close the gate to get in and out, we just step over it.
__label__neg	I'm not sure why but she doesn't mind it on her snack bowl just her cup.
__label__neg	"""The only draw back on the bowls is that they cannot be microwaved due to the permanently attached suction cup on the bottom."""
__label__neg	I certainly couldn't see him in the tiny rearview mirror attachment
__label__neu	Also, my son had no problems with colic.
__label__neu	When you follow the swaddling directions,  it is like having 5 flannel blankets on top of her (count the layers),  and when we unwrapped her she was all sweaty,  even in the AC.
__label__pos	My son likes to look at the different animals on the bumper while he falls asleep.The set comes with 6 pieces - bed skirt, bumper, quilt, valance (approx.
__label__pos	Unlike other swings this swing is very roomy!
__label__pos	I bought this because it's so much cuter than a rinse cup & my daughter seemed to like it
__label__neg	I wish I would have just bought a new body pillow, it would have saved me a lot of money and headache dealing with this huge thing
__label__pos	And it is tethered to the cover,  so when baby thinks it would be funny to launch it out onto a nasty floor,  it doesn't work out as planned
__label__neg	I tried emailing Columbia about it but they never wrote back.
__label__neg	Cute,  but unsafe,  unsafe,  unsafe
__label__neu	The picture color is so faded that it almost looks like black and white.
__label__neu	It's hilarious!
__label__neg	"""It pulls up on your shirt so make sure you wear a long one!"""
__label__pos	I carry this matt (rolled up) in the basket of our stroller when we go out in case we eat out, and always make sure to take it when we visit friends and family.
__label__neg	I'm disappointed in this chair because I think Baby Trend usually makes good products. 
__label__neu	Good thing is that amazon charges less than stores for the First years tub (well in Alaska).
__label__neu	You can find ours at Goodwill.
__label__neg	 there's only one hole and he got frustrated sucking so hard. 
__label__neg	I have clipped my child's little fingers more than his nails with these
__label__neg	 This really isn't the most hygienic method of diaper disposal
__label__pos	I think he'll like it more when he can play with it like a ball, rather than trying to use it as a teether.
__label__neg	 This one appears to want to re-invent the wheel and of course fails miserably: when the baby is facing the sun this shade does not do anything to cover his/her face
__label__pos	Love, love, love this swing as does my infant child.
__label__pos	i LOVE the design on these also. 
__label__pos	We did find it useful around the house outside the tub.
__label__pos	"""He is actually enjoying bath time for the first time!!!"""
__label__neu	However,  it would barely swing with the baby in it.
__label__neu	I use this with the Medela Pump In Style Advance.
__label__pos	"""Even though I don't think it's particularly cool-looking, she does, and that counts!"""
__label__neg	It was the one toy I knew I'd never buy for my children
__label__neg	The blanket was soft when I first got it,  but with several washings they are becoming rougher.
__label__pos	They truly do help eliminate colic and keep your baby safe and out of harmful chemicals way like BPA.
__label__neg	after a few use, the trap leaves a big hole and so the food falls out of the cup easily.
__label__pos	I didn't have this bouncer in the first few weeks, but once I purchased it, I don't know what I did without it!  
__label__neg	 It was OK when he was a little baby and could fit in the sling part, but the pillow would get very cold very fast, and keeping him warm while trying to bathe him at the same time was a challenge
__label__neg	Adding a 1/2 cup water to it does, but then were back to ITS NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!! 
__label__pos	"""And she has broken pretty much everything else that she can get her hands on."""
__label__neu	Don't get suckered into buying a contraption that forces you to spend money on proprietary bags.
__label__neu	We are still using it more than 2 years after purchase though,  since it does work with the modifications
__label__neu	I have 15 month old twins and they haven't tried to pull them out.
__label__neg	It's also difficult to hold the shower head and hold the button down they could've had a better design there.
__label__pos	"""You can buy it at Target or anywhere Medela products are sold."""
__label__neg	 Also it made my back sore
__label__pos	good product for the most part
__label__neg	 Sure, the idea of twisting the diapers into their own little sausage-like casings seems appealing, but all that twisting led to some real issues with my elbow - very painful. 
__label__pos	"""My daughter doesn't hurt herself on the coffee table now"""
__label__neu	Some many things match it outside of this collection too because of the blue and red combination.  
__label__pos	we tried to get away with just one exersaucer but they both loved it so much we broke down and bought another.
__label__pos	BUT, it made breast-feeding sooo much easier, and then the sitting up stage, and well, now I use it for myself, instead of a pillow.
__label__neu	The Inclined to Sleep positioner isn't our favorite because our 3 week old slides down in it while sleeping and wakes up crying and uncomfortable.(This doesn't happen in the Air Flow which is 1/2 the price!)
__label__neg	I never filled them past the line but they ALWAYS LEAKED when they were cold.
__label__neg	So please,  please make sure you do not fall into this category before buying this chair.
__label__neg	"""But..."""
__label__neu	She cannot draw the milk in from these nipples and if she is hungry enough to do the extra work it takes about 40 minutes to eat 4 oz.
__label__neu	I have decided just to buy a soft kids seat for the big toilet and a step stool. 
__label__pos	The biggest plus to this diaper pail is that you can use any plastic bag you want
__label__neg	 I basically toss it out after many times of trying
__label__neg	We are looking into a  smaller Britax.
__label__pos	"""It was fine at first before we fed our baby to solids."""
__label__neg	I wish they could make these like real static cling that you can dip into water then squeegee them onto the window.
__label__neu	I don't know about everyone else, but I only run my dishwasher at most every other day, and I didn't have enough bottles to last that long when she was eating every couple of hours.
__label__neu	It's definitely not worth ordering online and paying for shipping,  I suggest if you want to try this get it at a store where you can return it if you experience the same problems as I have.
__label__neu	You have to string the twist-tie into each bag by yourself.
__label__pos	The first moment I tried it out,  it felt comfortable,  as it is very stuffed and does offer support.
__label__pos	I love it...
__label__neu	The only thing you can hear is static.
__label__pos	My son fits in it comforably and I love the convenience of the 3 levels, tray cover and lightweight portability.  
__label__pos	I'd recommend these to anyone who is breastfeeding and wants to introduce a bottle in addition to the breast.
__label__neu	"My lactation nurse has ""My Brest Friend"" pillows and they are SO much better!"
__label__neg	 If you are crazy enough to buy them SAVE YOUR RECEIPT
__label__neg	 The only way you can keep a Peg Perego Primo Viaggio car seat from completely falling off is to use a strap that it somes with
__label__neu	It turned out that we needed an extra bag so I took the carseat out and replaced it with the First Years reclining booster seat (for eating) a boppy and some clothes and had a ton of room.
__label__neg	 It is a joke
__label__pos	Well worth the money.
__label__pos	Just as well since they say to wean them off around 4-6 months anyway.
__label__neu	They are genius I just wish that the fabric wasn't so itchy!
__label__pos	It seems to stick and feels like it would require a lot of pressure to actually get parts to move.
__label__pos	Very unique and different from other swings.
__label__neu	I have inexpensive mattresses so this may fit snugger on a big thick mattress that you have to pay more for.
__label__neg	The motor is a bit noisy, but does not overbear the music.2.
__label__neg	After 2 months of constant use, 4 times a day, one day last week the suction would not work
__label__neu	Don't buy this!
__label__neg	Let me start by saying that we used Playtex Ventair bottles with my first child
__label__neu	He never got into the lights until he got too big for it. 
__label__neu	I just got this bedding for my son from Babies R Us.
__label__pos	It has fun colors,  very attractive,  you can tell that the bottle is working from the air you hear coming out of the bottom suction and the awesome nipple that babies can actually get a grip on
__label__pos	But I tried it again with her at about 3 weeks and she loves it.
__label__pos	She would lie mesmerized by the musical star and also loved playing with, reaching for, grabbing, and eventually even taking off all the things that hang from the various loops.  
__label__neg	This monitor is not worth the extra price
__label__pos	 I don't regret my purchase because of the stool which works really great. 
__label__neg	I spent more time trying to keep this thing in place,  and then the minute it slipped off,  he peed anyway
__label__neu	The stool can be adjusted to two heights. 
__label__pos	For the price I think its the best choice out there.
__label__pos	Our son has fit just perfectly.  
__label__neu	It's a hard toy,  has no appeal to her at all.
__label__pos	The colors are great it's easy to assemble & adjust.
__label__pos	my 4 day old son loved this swing he slept in it for hours it was the best $165.00 i ever spent for my lil one and for my sanity.
__label__neu	He slept in it from day 1.The storage drawer is very shallow and can only hold a very thin blanket or sheets.The quality seems very high.
__label__neg	 I have found that keeping a clean bottle, a bottle of water at room temp and some powder formula (save your scoops) work the best for feedings on the road
__label__pos	I love that almost every piece can be easily washed and the others just take a little more time.
__label__neg	 So we will see how it works for us in the future
__label__neg	 You're better off putting a stool on the ground and a seat on the toilet
__label__pos	"""I hope ours continues to perform well."""
__label__neu	"""My daughter started using this gym when she was just over 2 months old."""
__label__neg	 I have a Graco Quattro Tour and the straps aren't long enough for either
__label__neg	"The worst part for boys is that if you/they are not careful the design tends to allow ""sprayage"" all over the place as there isn't much room between the kids ""junk"" and the front of the bowl.  "
__label__neg	We also tried with bananas and got the same result.
__label__neu	We got now Greco and very happy.
__label__neu	For a less expensive solution, check out the microwaveable version,Philips Avent Express II Microwave Steam Sterilizer without Bottle
__label__pos	I love this product!
__label__neg	My baby thought this was a bit too much stimulation.
__label__pos	"""Too bad they didn't have this 9 months ago!"""
__label__pos	It was great when my daughter would wake up for her middle-of-the-night feedings.
__label__neg	" The back is very flat- so I never felt like the baby was really ""in"" a seat, more like leaning on it"
__label__neg	I like the THINK BABY bottle much more. 
__label__pos	Great great stroller after having a couple of crummy ones (and one good one, but that was big and bulky).  
__label__pos	"""i got this product so i don't have to fill in the whole bath tub for my baby son, as well as it seems like a good transition from the infant tub to the bath tub."""
__label__neu	Used it since she was about 3 weeks old.
__label__neu	The pictures of this set on Amazon and kidsline do not do the set justice.
__label__neg	 I don't think this carrier works well for short women with big babies (she was 8lbs
__label__neu	I have read through some of the ridiculous low-star reviews and can't believe how anal people are.  
__label__pos	We prefer the wubbanub pacifier.
__label__neg	My son doesn't like the music/forest sounds.
__label__neg	 To be wet then above the water just didn't work
__label__neu	Avent makes a great manual breast pump,  but they need to put a better bottle on the market.
__label__neg	 No chance
__label__neg	" Add to the fact that you have to fill it while in its ""sleeve"", which adds another translucent layer, you might as well forget about measuring out quantities"
__label__pos	My daughter still plays with it,  and now she helps my 1yr old son use they toy.
__label__neg	I have avoided buying the attachment because it looks so big!
__label__neu	I looked at several buggy covers in various price ranges.
__label__neg	Well that was a big mistake.
__label__neg	So,  I hope I can use it much better when I will be breastfeeding my baby - at least it would not be waste of money then.
__label__neu	I bought at christmas for my son,  he is now 4.
__label__pos	You can get a much better product,  called the Diaper Champ.
__label__neg	 Now the openings for his legs are not big enough (facing away from me
__label__neu	 The tote is about 1 inch too short.
__label__pos	"""I use the Bundle Me Lite and that works great..."""
__label__pos	Love It! 
__label__pos	That makes me feel better and sets my mind at ease about using these with my children.
__label__neu	 I know the baby won't care... 
__label__neg	"""The only thing I found which was untrue was using it to nurse after, it is way to long for that."""
__label__pos	I mastered getting the baby in and out both awake and asleep after a couple of days which is great because he falls asleep in it almost every time.
__label__pos	but WOW what awesome CS.
__label__neu	;)We haven't had a problem with them being too narrow but your mileage may vary here.
__label__neu	"""If you plan on using Avent, bring some bottles with you to the hospital and instruct the nurses to check with you before bottle feeding your baby."""
__label__neg	 It doesn't do anything but float
__label__neg	These bags do not measure up to the Medela name and they should consider a new design.
__label__neg	These don't stick without the help of your adhesive of choice.
__label__neg	 It also has a weird dent in that same part that matches the bottles. 
__label__pos	I highly recommend.
__label__pos	"""My son has had this seat since before birth and uses it everyday."""
__label__neu	"I use store brand non-drop-ins because theyre cheaper and the regular ""bag"" liner colapses easier."
__label__pos	The range is excellent.  
__label__pos	I actually purchased it used from an infant resale shop and I am so happy that I did
__label__neg	 Save your time money, and sanity
__label__pos	I was better off with the regular pillow between my legs.
__label__pos	"""I'm pretty fond of all Avent products and this doesn't disappoint."""
__label__neg	 Then it stalled...so overall...a good idea...but it doesn't last.
__label__neg	I took my almost 3-year-old to Target to try this seat out.
__label__neu	BPA free brands include Born Free,  Nurture Pure,  MAM,  Green to Grow,  Baby Life and Adrini.
__label__neg	 thirdly, the sun shines through around it and my kid screamed anyway
__label__neu	I know it's out of the way and I also know where all of the parts are.Get some extra sealing discs.
__label__neu	At the end of the day,  we toss them out into the garage
__label__neg	I've now purchased 2 of these.
__label__pos	"""Don't make the same mistake we did..."""
__label__pos	The thing I love the most about them is the fact they are BPA free.
__label__pos	It fits many different shaped of chairs out there (as long as not a sofa!
__label__neg	The only con is that it can be tough to open until you get the hang of it. 
__label__pos	This is a wonderful product for nursing.
__label__neu	THEY SAID THAT I WAS NOT PUTTING THE NIPPLE AND RING ON CORRECTLY.
__label__neg	" Note the fine print: only ""parts that come into contact with breastmilk"" are BPA-free, which means the handle, the part YOU touch the most, has BPA, as I discovered from the little #7 plastic sign on the back"
__label__neu	We used the aquarium swing more than anything.
__label__neu	I switched to a combo potty seat that has a removable soft seat & a much bigger hole.
__label__pos	We have several of these in various sizes and fabrics.
__label__pos	"""he is tall for his age & will be able to wear this for a LONG time, it is big & roomy."""
__label__neu	My youngest daughter bounced in the jumperoo every day from 5-months-old to 9-months-old.  
__label__pos	 and I'm very satisfied with the exchange
__label__neu	I bought this,  I received another type of swaddling blanket and my baby HATED this.
__label__pos	"""You will not go wrong buying this swing!"""
__label__neg	I like the more classic purpose behind this toy.
__label__neu	Let's face it, after a certain age, kids don't want to 'sit' all day. 
__label__neu	You must wash the bottles before putting them in the Sterilizer.
__label__neu	But, while traveling, you don't always have the ability to boil the product.
__label__neu	I wish the reviews of the newer Fisher-Price model that replaced ours were better at the time we purchased this.
__label__neg	Also when I'm traveling with this swing I need to set it down to put the baby down and open the car door but there are no wide steady feet to set it down on you just have to let it collapse on the floor.
__label__pos	"""We love this product so much that when I see people at the store looking at the Diaper Genie vs. the Champ I will go up to them and tell them to select the Diaper Champ."""
__label__neu	Battery replacement requires screwdriver. 
__label__neu	They are short and fat bottles,  so you really have to lean your baby back to get all the liquid to the nipple.
__label__pos	These bottles do not leak so Iam thinking what is going on?
__label__pos	The first one worked nicely for about 2 weeks
__label__neu	He was buckled in, and I was using one of those head support things. 
__label__neg	I really liked the Medela products at first, but I never really liked these bags, mainly because you have to tie them with a folded over twist tie to close them. 
__label__pos	"""I haven't used the straps for the teething toys yet, but the soft rail cover is perfect for my daughter."""
__label__neg	lol)I am not a fan of any shield
__label__neu	I read the reviews on this product before buying it.  
__label__neg	I bought this baby wipe warmer in hopes that it was compatible with german housing
__label__pos	its soft and cushy and baby doesn't slide around.
__label__neg	 I didn't get it-- it was warm, soft-- he didn't care and wanted nothing to do with it-- preferred this hideous baby seat every time
__label__neg	The position of the baby can shift with your movement (ie. if you go from sitting to standing or if you need to lean over a little bit ); that disrupts and upsets my baby.
__label__pos	"""It is great."""
__label__neg	It's a cute toy but it doesn't serve it's purpose and my 10mo old is certainly not entertained by it
__label__neu	He can stand up and hold on to the sides.
__label__neg	Now that she's sitting up its starting to get pretty messy though.
__label__neu	Also, he seems to sleep better and for longer spells.
__label__neu	If your like me you have drying racks for dishes and baby bottles there and this just won't fit
__label__neg	But my son sucked on it for 5 minutes and got nothing out of it
__label__neu	If I can't find a use for it,  I'll probably throw it away.
__label__neg	losing milk is well like losing money
__label__neg	One major negative to me is the depth of the drawers
__label__pos	Good Wipe Warmer
__label__neg	It sucks batteries like there's no tomorrow.
__label__pos	It has saved me from my laundry nightmare.  
__label__neg	We HAD a Diaper Genie, it's a total waste of money and plastic.
__label__neg	I am usually bare foot and they irritate my apparently sensative feet.
__label__pos	It was obvious he really liked it by the big smiles and how his mind was preoccupied with the play items on the sides and bottom.
__label__neu	Flat.  
__label__neg	The only down side is that it's not very intersting to him for tummy time because he can't pick his head up very far yet. 
__label__neu	I use it to block my garage so that my 2 year old doesn't run out of the garage and into the street.
__label__pos	"""Therefor I am happy with this purchase."""
__label__pos	UPDATE:  I sealed all the edges of the seat with some silicon caulking (got it from Lowes for $3) and now the pee goes where it's supposed to go - into the toilet! 
__label__neg	 Plus, it shrinks in the wash
__label__pos	It is great.
__label__pos	Love it!
__label__neg	The Diaper Genie is the worst piece of crap I have ever used. 
__label__pos	It shuts off by itself every 15 minutes, which is great because I often forget to turn it off.
__label__neu	Seriously save yourself some money and buy an original one (even if it's used).
__label__neu	"""I got this as a gift at my shower.."""
__label__pos	The purple color is great and it all comes in a great carrying case complete with an important information magnet that you can stick on the refrigerator for baby sitter's etc.
__label__neg	baby could choke on it if you ask me. 
__label__neg	Big Mistake. 
__label__neu	It is SOOO difficult,  feels like it will snap any second.
__label__pos	I highly recommend this seat, it can be used for longer than the conventional car seat, which is safer for baby.
__label__neg	it was the monitor that kept us up
__label__pos	I exchanged it for the model below and love it!
__label__neg	I am disappointed with the quality if this item
__label__pos	I highly recommend these and Sleepsacks for when they are older.
__label__neu	Then I thought wait a minute the regular potty doesn't have those things.
__label__neu	Initially i loved the product.
__label__neg	 It is flimsy and bends frighteningly underneath small children even if you push the traveler seat all the way back so it is supported underneath the back (as per the included instructions)
__label__pos	I highly recommend this lock!
__label__neu	I agonized over whether to buy this cheaper pump or go straight to one of the high-end ($250+) models
__label__neg	Too expensive & difficult to clean so not worth the money
__label__neg	Did the designers of this bottle ever try USING this thing to feed a real baby
__label__pos	I had a ton of bottles, so I didn't want to spend the extra money for the breast milk storage containers.
__label__neu	I think maybe it was just too quiet for her without the noises she had become accustomed to. 
__label__neu	Buy a simple foam mat with no small connectors
__label__neg	I'm annoyed by this product.
__label__pos	"""I also love the fact that it works on batteries so I can roam around the house with it clipped to my belt or I can plug them in to save the batteries."""
__label__neg	Our baby would slip down and it was akward for her to sleep in
__label__neg	 Once by holding onto the rungs and shaking the gate the other time by grabbing one of the rungs when he tripped
__label__pos	I could sit up in bed and feed on this him well I was still relaxed.
__label__neu	I haven't had a problem with the bag not being full enough.
__label__neg	The middle mobile toy (the lion) rotates between a really wussy purr and a VERY short song. 
__label__neu	Diaper Genie.
__label__neg	EVER!
__label__neg	 It does elevate the baby more than the yellow sponge, but I had a few things I didn't like about it
__label__neu	She took it without much problem and I'm confident it won't be an issue when I go back to work
__label__neu	Then,  when I tried to return it for a refund,  they had an administrative glitch and refunded us for $0.
__label__pos	Great idea and was easy to use.
__label__neg	Obviously that was not an option.
__label__neg	but I was very disappointed with this product.  
__label__pos	This cute storage provides a useful place to store all the baby materials from the hospital and doctor's visit.
__label__neg	"""There is so much they could have done with this that they didn't."""
__label__neu	The sling option was nice for my newborn baby, but, as he got bigger I had to remove the sling because there was a big hump of plastic jabbing him in the back. 
__label__neu	These are good, but they twist on the car seat shoulder straps.  
__label__pos	I purchased this item before a family vacation and it is a very helpful tool.
__label__pos	We've used gates for years with our pets and this is by far superior to any others we've used.
__label__pos	The hammock makes it so easy to wash my 2 month old.  
__label__neu	I cant even bath him,  as I am trying to keep him upright to wash.
__label__pos	I would not recommend this as the only stroller you own, but is perfect for a second car or for grandma's house.
__label__neu	!
__label__neg	Our baby loves to kick on the changing table, but she has reflux and kicking flat generates a lot of spitup, plus it doesn't allow us much freedom.
__label__pos	It's comfy easy to clean.
__label__neg	 It has a very prominent curve to it which causes this. 
__label__neg	The suction dies down almost immediately making pumping take so much longer
__label__pos	Then again,  it was SOOOO WORTH IT,  when we travelled
__label__neu	Baby has had less gas and fussiness since we have been using these bottles.  
__label__neu	 I hope that doesn't happen again
__label__pos	we have little interferance with other equipment (my hubby is a geek and we have it all!
__label__pos	These are just the top few reasons why we love this gate.
__label__neg	Most babies are stronger than velcro and magnetic clasps.
__label__neg	Eventually, one of them punctured it and we didn't try to put a patch on it.
__label__neu	I live in Seattle and didn't like the way the straps of my Babyhawk would drag on the muddy ground while I was trying to put it on outdoors in parking lots, etc.  
__label__neg	NOT WORTH THE MONEY,  AND I ONLY GIVE IT TWO STARS,  BUT SINCE I EDITED MY REVIEW,  IT WON'T LET ME CHANGE THE NUMBER OF STARS I GAVE IT (I first reviewed it when I was using smaller glass bottles with not as many parts
__label__pos	Great for both smaller (newborn) and/or larger babies.
__label__neg	 They didn't pull the nipple out far enough to make any difference, and the pressure on the nipple made me leak constantly. 
__label__pos	Not only that it is thick and fluffy, like a good quality mattress cover should be to add softness and quality of sleep to a bed.
__label__neu	When I tried to fill it with my wipes box,  baby powder,  and lotion--as shown in the picture--the pockets tipped forward and everything fell out.
__label__neg	Even on a low heat the lining of one of mine separated from the bag partially tore and has come out.
__label__neg	The first time my 16 month used the cup she stuck her entire hand in it and pulled up really fast and all of her snack went flying
__label__neu	I don't know why other users have had trouble with static or humming--I haven't experienced that at all.
__label__pos	I love this idea and  so does my son. 
__label__pos	But it's still nice knowing there is a soft cover on the pad for the times when we don't have an additional topper on it.
__label__neu	Plus the gate is a pain to open and honestly it's just too small for a baby unless you get an extension.
__label__pos	 All around it is a better purchase!
__label__neu	Trust me, the bigger the better.
__label__neg	My baby has had some fun with this toy (3-5months) but it definately ranks far down the list of toys he enjoys and I'm sure there are hundreds of others I could have purchased instead of this one and gotten more playtime out of them.
__label__neg	She just sits there dangling and looking unhappy
__label__neg	The down side is the inside curve of the head part of the pillow.
__label__neg	Trying to work with Storkcraft is a joke too
__label__pos	"""We got these bottles because they are supposed to be the closest thing to breast feeding, and they advertise a 'slow-flow' nipple."""
__label__neg	You can turn up the volume to hear the baby, but you will be listening to a lot of static and won't be able to sleep at night
__label__neg	 The wipes were always hard and brown at the bottom
__label__pos	"""I can see how these bottles may be frustrating for some families, but the features some people dislike (dual nipple, collapsable outer nipple, etc) are the same features that have helped me maintain a breastfeeding relationship for over a year while working full time."""
__label__neu	The lids do hold the food in well for traveling, but quite bulky.  
__label__neu	The mighty tite is just collecting dust.
__label__pos	This is a must have for all moms and dads.
__label__neg	My other complaint is that is is bulky and big and if you live in a little house like we do there is no room for it.
__label__neu	first,  it takes quite a bit of pressure
__label__neu	I used this bath for the first 3 months and it was great when using the sling,  but when my son got too big for the sling and was sitting up,  we tried the sitting position.
__label__neu	"""Why?"""
__label__neu	I do wish that this was hands-free like my other pail, but it works much better on smell.
__label__neu	Will add customer pic to product for example
__label__neu	The gates don't stay locked in place so it moves all over.
__label__pos	He is now 10 months and I can't imagine life without it
__label__neu	We have had the original Co-Sleeper for 2.5 years. 
__label__pos	"""you have to have realistic expectations for this bowl."""
__label__neg	The pillow is painfully missing back support, and the middle dips and sags
__label__neu	I have used others by Gerber and Avent- which both leaked!  
__label__neg	Not very good at all; definitely not worth the price. 
__label__pos	 Loud enough
__label__neu	For him the whole benefit of being swaddled is that his arms are held in and he doesn't wake himself with them.
__label__neu	Other reviewers said it as well.
__label__pos	I like that I can go into small shops or the park without taking a bulky infant car seat.
__label__neu	"""Gradually, she has begun playing with the swinging parts and she can make it work on the ""baby"" setting."""
__label__neu	UNFORTUNATELY,  the battery has a MEMORY.
__label__neg	"""3.  The replacement bags are expensive and they have different types for different ages in order to be more complicated."""
__label__pos	"""It has lots of space for all the parts of the bottle."""
__label__neu	If you buy these,  you may want to buy locally in case you need to return them
__label__pos	It will be nice to have the both since we are turtle fans!
__label__neu	When that happens, I have just added a bit of water and it restores them nicely.
__label__pos	There was one missing part to the drawer but I emailed customer service about it and had the part shipped to me within a week so I was also very satisfied with the customer service aspect.
__label__neu	"Sometimes you have to wonder if people have kids when they ""invent"" stuff."
__label__neg	 If you have an alternative, go with it
__label__neg	 That guard is awful and makes it nearly impossible to see what you are doing
__label__pos	It absorbs all baby drool and I don't have to wash the Baby Bjorn after every outing.
__label__neu	 This brush still has a durability issue, however, I've come to the conclusion that it's probably a good idea to throw out bottle brushes every few weeks anyway. 
__label__pos	This one is really a peach.
__label__pos	I originally bought this for my daughter's lunches, but it's so darn cute and the size is just right to fit in my bag that I ended up using it and bought her something else.
__label__neg	 Therefore, have the material be pre-shrunk before marketing it
__label__neg	I now use a garbage can with a lid and change it frequently--a much simpler solution. 
__label__neu	I mean,  why would you spend money on a nice kitchen only to drill holes inside doors and drawers?
__label__pos	This swing is wonderful and if I could give more than five stars I would.  
__label__neu	Our $20 Safety First monitor far surpasses this one - even on its last leg.
__label__neu	lol
__label__neu	He puts other things inside them under them.
__label__neg	These pads are too small and too thick. 
__label__pos	Of course supervision is still required but makes you feel safer knowing the baby is eating healthy food and staying safe from choking.
__label__neu	And most wipes when you open them up anymore aren't that cold at all.
__label__neu	So, unless your house is HUGE, or you sleep in the second floor while the baby is in the first one (or backwards) use your money in diapers!
__label__neg	those are badly made.
__label__neg	 Boys tend not to like cold down there
__label__neg	I used it once and it's been in the closet ever since
__label__neg	We got 2 of these and had the same problem with both.
__label__neg	No matter how hard I work it's impossible to keep this tub clean.
__label__pos	I put my camera,  wristlet,  baby food,  and bottle of water and keys in there and there's still room left over
__label__pos	I like them
__label__neu	 It held up moderately for a couple of months. 
__label__neg	Don't bother!!!
__label__neg	 You really have to be on your toes about it and who has the time, nevertheless; the ENERGY
__label__neu	In an effort to stop my son's painful gas, I have been through countless bottles.  
__label__neu	Yeah right,  I'm not waiting for an accident to find out whether the clip is really locked into the buckle or not
__label__neg	"It is soft so it does not create the ""flat"" surface that is ideal for coloring and balancing toys"
__label__neu	they need to make it with real wood or stronger material!
__label__neu	The product has a 25 lb weight limit, but at 20 lbs, my son was too big for the seat. 
__label__neu	My favorite is lansinoh.
__label__neu	In the review I stated to go for a pail where you can use your own bags that's what had done.
__label__pos	Wonderful!
__label__pos	My son loves this toy! 
__label__pos	It's a great size and easy to clean.
__label__pos	This is a delightful toy! 
__label__neg	I would not buy these again
__label__neg	Some young children find the spout easier than other sippies,  and we used it as a transition sippy before switching over to the Playtex model.
__label__neu	"""I learned the hard way."""
__label__neu	"""Of course, we always kept an eye on our son, too."""
__label__pos	"He will point to the ceiling and say ""stars."""
__label__pos	I appreciate that the sterilizer doesnt take up much cupboard space and holds alot of bottles, nipples,pacifiers, etc.
__label__neg	 It's going back
__label__neg	Like other reviewers, I feel that it is not firm enough to support the hips and I just don't find it comfortable enough to use as a neck pillow. 
__label__pos	Don't know why she likes this particular toy but it's a winner.
__label__pos	Great Diaper Pail
__label__pos	My baby wanted to bounce more than my arms could accommodate and this was the solution.
__label__pos	She loves the bright colors and they've kept her entertained for three months now.
__label__pos	"""It makes everything so compact compared to the other travel systems out there i.e. Graco, etc."""
__label__neg	"""Unfortunately, the chair is on carpet in our apartment, and so doesn't rotate or lift as easily as if on a hard floor, but that hasn't been a huge problem."""
__label__neu	They can rip out the filter that keeps the odors inside.
__label__pos	A friend of mine had the same problem, and she recommends the Especially for Baby brand (less expensive and better quality).
__label__neu	I tried the sitting up position with her at two and a half months and she she likes it, though she doesn't seem to sleep well that way.
__label__pos	It is wonderful and very affordable taking into consideration how much the baby toys are for one (anywhere for a few bucks to 7 or so for small toys) and you get 9-10 with this so very well worth the price you get your moneys worth.
__label__pos	My two cents about this fantastically designed mobile by the Tiny Love folks: our two-month old gets &quot;hipnotized&quot; by the figures SO MUCH, that the truth is he stops noticing anything else aruond him.
__label__neu	We much rather use our FABULOUS Quattro tour system than this!!!
__label__neg	 Okay for quick trips, but if going out for several hours I suggest investing some money in an adjustable baby sling or pouch like Maya Wrap
__label__neu	The sippy cups are another story entirely
__label__neu	But as my friends say, my baby lives in her swing.
__label__neg	The only other issue is that the lid collects condensed water and I am afraid of it leaving a puddle on our furniture.
__label__pos	No slouching, very comfy and cozy - a definite must buy for any baby shower.
__label__pos	We keep ours in the garage (have had it for 9 months) and have had no problems with smells (regardless of the weather 10- to 98 degrees).
__label__neg	My girl doesn't seem to mind this at all, but other babies might.
__label__neu	Well the fact that it is a leash was really not the problem, cause I mean when you buy it, you already know that! 
__label__pos	"""We used this lounger sooo much with our son."""
__label__pos	Everything is at a hands reach when I am changing my daugher (6 weeks old now) and I literally can hold her with one hand and reach everything with the other because of this.
__label__neg	 I used it once
__label__pos	My Snoogle is sooooooo comfy, I didn't want to get up!
__label__pos	We LOVE this smock and just ordered a second one for my daughter.
__label__pos	Revised: I kept having it burn out and needing to replace it.
__label__neg	Don't waste your money
__label__pos	"""But then again I guess it would be a rocker and not a bouncer, so if you have time to sit in front of the baby and bounce the bouncer back and forth and sing this is great, if you have to get things done put the baby in the swing.."""
__label__neg	 This is a problem that needs to be fixed by the manufacture. 
__label__pos	"""I've tried the washable breastpads and they're no good!"""
__label__neu	How much would you pay to have some safeguard against your little one choking as they learn to eat new foods?
__label__pos	"""My daughter is very laid back, knock on wood, but I thought this would be especially nice for those midnight diaper changes when she was young because it wouldn't wake her up as much as a cold wipe would, and it didn't."""
__label__pos	but hey, I wasn't even expecting the foam pieces at all.
__label__pos	It clicks on tightly and holds the car seat firmly in place.
__label__neg	The Boppy pillow sucks for breastfeeding!  
__label__pos	I love it!
__label__pos	And the prints are simple and adorable.
__label__neu	"As a first time parent,  I thought they looked great for ""swaddling for dummies""!"
__label__pos	The seat is really cozy and my son loves the mirror.
__label__pos	The rest of the product is ok
__label__neu	There's got to be something better...
__label__neu	I bought these bowls expecting them to end the food-dumping behavior that so many are complaining about.  
__label__pos	I agree with others - this bag does it's job.
__label__neu	My daughter didn't do well with it at all.
__label__pos	It supports her, so she's comfy while she eats.
__label__neg	 I am back to using my antibacterial wipes to clean the table off which is the only effective method that I have found so far
__label__pos	I would definitely buy it again.
__label__neg	 I took all the washable parts off again and put them back on 6 times, before it started working again
__label__pos	This is a great swaddle blanket especially if you have a big baby that can wiggle out of most other blankets.
__label__neu	I threw them right in the trash.
__label__pos	Also when my husband lets me sleep in on weekends, he feeds the baby either formula or some cooled breastmilk if it's available.
__label__pos	Worth every dime.
__label__pos	"""But that's the same with all soft toys that can't be machine washed, so it's not a serious drawback."""
__label__neg	No, not any better at all. 
__label__neg	 Brown's standard nipple which worked great, but I hated washing all those parts
__label__pos	This changing pad cover feels luxuriously soft and plush, and it's nice to know our baby's head is resting on something so comfortable.
__label__pos	"""Highly recommended."""
__label__neu	Until then,  hands down,  Sure Comfort Deluxe Newborn-to-Toddler Tub (or a similarly shaped tub) has my vote!
__label__neg	This sheet was so rough I could not lay my baby on it
__label__neu	Let's face it babies are expensive and whenever you can save $ you should.
__label__neg	These bottles are extremely frustrating.
__label__neu	I discovered Medela Microwave Steam Cleaning Bags instead and this thing went in the closet.
__label__neg	I only used this tub maybe twice after removing the sling
__label__neg	I do wish that it came with a pop-up adapter or something.
__label__pos	"""Bought this based on other reviews and figured for the price of a coffee and cookie if this didn't work it wouldn't be so bad."""
__label__neu	Also they don't really block the sun either,  I don't think any product like these would.
__label__pos	The mirror mesmerizes her and she loves pulling at the toys.
__label__neg	 I would not recommend this one to anyone
__label__neg	This pump is such a waste of money
__label__pos	The folding is super quick with the soft plastic guide so that even my husband can do it neatly.
__label__neg	 I noticed that my son always chewed the straw (the silicone part, not the BPA part which is inside)
__label__neg	It smells like a skunk.
__label__pos	Ours doesn't have any sharp edges.
__label__pos	I think this monitor is a pretty good bet
__label__neg	 No good
__label__neg	 They are expensive for only 4 bottles and totally unnecessary. 
__label__neu	I couldn't believe it
__label__neg	 Aside from the ability to bounce and the softness of this device, the reason I wanted it was the soothing sounds
__label__pos	"""All the pieces are a pain to keep up with and the dishwasher rarely gets the inserts clean but they are well worth the handwashing."""
__label__neg	I switched to Dr.
__label__pos	I loved the Ashley Floral pattern...not only cute and girly but practical for the hot summers here in Texas.
__label__neg	impossible to put anything in it or accesswish it will recline moreLonger handle ( I am 5 2 and on off i kick the back of the wheels.
__label__neg	I had the same problem with the mobile falling to the back, but if you move the arm forward enough, it doesn't fall back, but it wont turn, because the bears hit the area where the motor is.
__label__pos	I started having my son sit on this and the potty chair when he turned 14 months and he actually prefers sitting on this than the potty chair that is low to the ground.
__label__neu	I finally decided after 5 months of using Avent magic cups with little success to give the &quot;hard to use&quot; (as one mom had classified) playtex cup a try.
__label__pos	Next day I picked up at BRU (I had to get the extender peice too) and installed it.WONDERFUL.
__label__neu	Plus if he doesn't like something I didn't have to make a blender- full to find that out.
__label__pos	it holds a newborn perfectly.
__label__neg	This does fold up nice and small, but it is useless.
__label__neg	This pump advertises that it's design stimulates let-down, and that is not the case.
__label__neg	I purchased this to give as a gift; Sadly, the box arrived dented, and now I can't use this item
__label__pos	"""I read the reviews on this and we are so glad we recieved this as a gift."""
__label__pos	I had a few swaddlers from First YearsThe First Years Easy-Wrap Swaddler - Yellow (much cheaper and worked better), but my son outgrew them.
__label__neu	It pretty much prepared me for the battle that was about to unfold.
__label__neg	By the time he weighed 16lbs though, it wouldn't rock fast enough to keep him happy and he kept trying to crawl out.
__label__neu	Also unlike their cousin the 'Quilted Crib Mattress Pad' it doesn't pill up enough to care.
__label__neu	Then adjust for the car
__label__pos	I also like how it has a built in bath caddy to put baby's shampoo/soap/toys/washcloths whatever.
__label__pos	I only recommend this for those training very small children.
__label__neg	I have a few issues with this pillow. 
__label__neg	 I recommend the more sturdier ones, but they don't fold up as Convenient as this one
__label__neu	I had planned to buy the Evenflow saucer, however, my daughter seemed overwhelmed by all of the toys on the Evenflow.  
__label__neu	I thought maybe they would stick if we had tile,  but I see that others with tile tub surrounds can't get it to stick either.
__label__neg	These don't work that great at keeping our kids poop smells at bay in the trash
__label__neg	As others have said,  these bottles leak
__label__pos	The sling feature is perfect for newborns.
__label__pos	"""When our daughter was a newborn we placed her in and there she stayed, never slipping, while we washed her."""
__label__neg	 My second complaint is that the cutter doesnt work
__label__pos	This pack n play was easy to put together.
__label__neg	 She screamed when I put her in it
__label__pos	Brown's bottles which eliminated the gas problem all together.
__label__pos	great product.
__label__neu	I decided to try it out the one time I did travel,  my son was 4 months old
__label__neg	I love the Advent line & highly recommend their bottles & microwave sterilizer, but this breast pump is awful
__label__neg	It was always a guessing game with these bottles.
__label__pos	This is a good solution.
__label__neg	"""We now have the Fisher Price 900 mhz and it is THE BEST monitor!"""
__label__pos	One more thing - the suction is greatly improved if you lick the bottom of the bowl before you stick it to the table.  
__label__neg	Brown's bottle (7oz) with nipple and cap in this tote and it doesn't fit. 
__label__neu	Like
__label__neu	She woudln't even go for fruits that we knew she loved.
__label__neu	Be careful when changing the bag so it doesn't come down on your hand.
__label__neu	When there is a heavier baby in the swing you have to run it on high to get it to swing at all, but with my 2 week old daughter in it, it swings fine on the lower settings. 
__label__neu	I debated buying this car seat for about a month.
__label__neu	My son kept sliding down,  even with one hand on him at all times.
__label__pos	 Instead, it is kind of useful as a mirror to entertain the baby in the car
__label__neg	First of all,  the tub leaks
__label__pos	"""It goes on your sink, so you don't have to bend down to bathe your baby."""
__label__neg	 It doesn't fit well. 
__label__pos	"""I have a Medela breast pump, and this feeding and storage set is so helpful and easy to use!"""
__label__neg	I have this product on my baby registry and was disappointed to see that they price inflated by $10 overnight
__label__pos	It is really funny.
__label__neg	 So much static that sometimes I don't even hear my baby
__label__neg	 Next time I will make sure I have a 30 day return (at least that) before I make another purchase
__label__pos	This is my son's second favorite toy.  
__label__pos	For the most part I am very pleased with this product.
__label__neu	"""I did some research and found bottles made my Mother's Milkmate (mothersmilkmate.com or on ebay) These bottles are compatible with the Madela breast pump and nipple rings."""
__label__pos	Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.)
__label__neu	This is not just for a boy b/c it is a car girls like cars too!
__label__neu	Totally defeats the purpose of the suction bottoms.  
__label__neu	I am a new mother with a 4 month year old.
__label__pos	There are other settings with nature sounds crickets.
__label__neg	My hand hurt from having to squeeze the pump. 
__label__neu	 Oddly enough if you buy a bottle in the 
__label__neg	I also wouldn't mind boiling the bag if the product would work.
__label__pos	This is the best for me. 
__label__neu	If you use this item makes sure to check often for cracks!
__label__neu	You can fold it to adjust for the size of baby when they are small, and then adjust as they grow.
__label__neu	No lie.
__label__neu	"I needed a gate for the top of the stairs,  and searched Amazon for ""baby gate top of stairs"
__label__neu	Most sippy cups are extremely hard to get anything out of,  this is one of them.
__label__pos	Also the nipples are great for babies that used to the breast, or babies that are between the breast and bottle.
__label__neu	"""i dint have a leaking issue with these but they didn't stay in place well."""
__label__neu	I speak from experience.
__label__neu	"""So I got Dr. Brown bottles."""
__label__neu	"""my daughter outgrew her infant carseat at 7 months, so we had to get a convertible car seat."""
__label__pos	So for those of you who are desperate to have you babies stayed swaddled and nothing is working, try this and the other swaddle blanket I mentioned together.
__label__pos	They're durable, and they hold temperature for a long time.
__label__pos	These finger guards are simple to use and very effective.
__label__neu	Tells you a lot about the manufacturer's quality control.  
__label__pos	I love the look of this car seat and it's very comfortable for my son but it's also very hard to adjust the straps,  almost impossible.
__label__pos	My 5 month old really likes it too.
__label__neg	My son's room is very small and once I open the diaper pail his whole room begins to smell and its not like the pail is filled with dirty diapers when this occurs.
__label__neg	 You fill the tub up and they still sit out of the water
__label__pos	These have stood up very well in our dishwasher and hold all of our baby's bottles and parts
__label__neg	The item I like the least is the swing.
__label__pos	"Not only got us over a rough feeding patch but now means we don't have to face the horrors of weaning as it happened ""just like that"" with this bottle & nipple system"
__label__pos	Although rather large & cumbersome in my apartment, my newborn daughter was perfectly comfortable and secure in it.  
__label__pos	I also loved the idea for this product
__label__pos	My DD is always interested in her even tho she hangs off of her car seat all the time and she sees her often!
__label__neu	I did not want to try the Dr. Browns because of all the parts and they seemed too complicated.  
__label__neg	 No more crying from gas, she hardly ever spits up anymore, and she has a much easier time at feedings
__label__neu	I've gotten around this by using the guard upside down.
__label__neg	My mirror looked a little hazy when I installed it,  thinking it was just finger prints,  I left it until this week
__label__neg	 RIIIIGHHHTTT.. 
__label__pos	Adorable Swing
__label__neg	It is 20 feet from my child's room yet it constantly beeps that it is out of range. 
__label__pos	"""My favorite feature is the ability to listen constantly to every little noise (best for when your a brand new paranoid mommy) or you can set it to mute out the background noise and only hear when the baby actually stirs in the night."""
__label__neg	It did not fit my rail.
__label__neu	 I was about to buy the exact same gate since I was pretty happy with it before and I thought the age was the problem until I read the reviews. 
__label__neg	The new mom interviewed said that the product started emitting a burning smell, and when she looked down at it, she couldn't believe her eyes...
__label__neu	 We couldn't afford a high quality dresser this time around, and this dresser should do just fine
__label__neu	How difficult would it have been to make both sides adjustable?
__label__neu	 Then the straps started getting harder and harder to adjust. 
__label__pos	I bought this for my new daughter and she seems to love it.
__label__neg	 It took up so much space in the bed, it was also very hard & very dangerous
__label__neg	"""And as soon as baby can sit, that is if she hasn't outgrown this small tub by then, she will not want to lay down at the angle this tub puts her at."""
__label__pos	 The Wendy Bellisimo changing pad covers are only $2 more and much better quality fabric. 
__label__pos	If you are in the safe zone then I will have to say you may just love the chair as we did before the fall.
__label__neu	Plus I like having my baby used to room temp wipes because when I go out with her and do diaper changes with room temp wipes she is used to it and doesn't throw a fit.
__label__neg	"""bored."""
__label__neg	This montior does work well. 
__label__neu	Follow the instructions to the letter - this product will still smell bad after a few uses.
__label__pos	And you really can operate this thing with one hand
__label__pos	Plus, no pesticides used with it.
__label__neu	My 2-month-old son spits up even more after feeding (sometimes twice) with the Dr
__label__pos	"""I really like this sheet!"""
__label__neu	"""items such as the switchplate, hamper, photo frame.."""
__label__neu	-- I thought it was all hype.  
__label__pos	"""My son is 4 months old, and isn't using sunblock, so this has been a lifesaver!"""
__label__pos	I love it too because with my hands free I can take a bath with him and not worry about him tipping over.  
__label__neu	My advise to new or expectant parents is
__label__pos	What a great investment.
__label__neg	I used these bottles for expressed breast milk to give my husband a chance to feed our baby.
__label__neu	 I put banana in it, her favorite food and try to show her how to use it to eat it
__label__neg	It leaked and it was not a good size for my little man.
__label__neg	Really wanted to like this tub but finally returned it
__label__pos	"""After about two nights, he stopped crying when being put in his crib..."""
__label__neu	Not to mention the button to get the water to spray is extremely hard to press down.  
__label__neu	Whereas drawers open and close in the straight line.
__label__pos	Overall, very very happy with this product.
__label__neu	My husband and I are smart people,  but even after reading the instructions and following them closely,  I don't think we ever got this to work correctly.
__label__neg	The people at Playtex were very nice about replacing it, but come on! 
__label__pos	I've had this for about 2 months now, and it has never, not once, fallen down. 
__label__neu	We have two baskets of toys in there for him to play with.
__label__pos	When breastfeeding,  these are highly recomended
__label__neu	Could not have managed to have her Britax Marathon carseat (lugging it around) w/o this unique tool
__label__neu	Well I gave that one away and so I had to buy new.
__label__neu	The vibrator feature seemed to have a mind of its own - if it felt like it,  it would go on,  if not,  we were out of luck.
__label__neg	If you are using this as a trainer cup, to move your child to the sippy, do not buy. 
__label__pos	"""I'm surprised at the many negative reports."""
__label__pos	I've heard the hospital models are great but this works for me so I'm happy.
__label__neu	I think the title says it all.
__label__neg	 he put on weight very fast and wearing the baby bjorn was simply unbearable
__label__neg	My son just doesn't like it
__label__neu	The design of this changing pad is wonderful but the cover needs to be more durable. 
__label__neg	 IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK
__label__pos	UPDATE:  Unfortunately, I cannot change the star review or I'd bump it up to 4 stars +. 
__label__neg	Gets activated with the slightest bump - not good if baby is not ready for a bottle
__label__neg	 There are better and more interactive toys out there
__label__pos	When they came to visit they put her in it and she took a two hour nap they couldn't believe!
__label__neg	Once your child is too big to fit in a playpen, you can get this so that they have more room to play, but still have them contained.
__label__neu	The cubby has a mesh front, as well as a mesh bottom so that all toys dry completely without mildewing.  
__label__pos	But the bags last a long time.  
__label__neu	4 adults comfortably if there's nothing to eat and they're just keeping their bums dry.
__label__neg	These don't stick at all! 
__label__pos	It plays great music that you'll love also!
__label__neg	"""For breast-feeding newborn babies I think that My Brest Friend is a lot more comfortable to wear."""
__label__neu	 It holds the clothes and when his room remodel is finished I'll probably toss it
__label__neg	I do like the two monitors and that it can clip on your hip if you are moving around, but I find the static extremely annoying and disturbing.
__label__pos	The changing table is fine. 
__label__neg	Washed it once according to directions & it shrunk beyond belief!
__label__neg	Well babies don't suck that way
__label__pos	If this is all you can afford,  it's not that bad.
__label__pos	 It has easy maintenance
__label__neg	 Needless to say none worked
__label__neg	"""It still has many flaws."""
__label__pos	This tub can go from birth to 2 yrs old.
__label__pos	"""But the Boppy also gets the job done."""
__label__neu	it does not have a hook/clip to attach it to a stroller or car seat and the panda is on the inside with a black and white bullseye on the outside flap of one side.  
__label__pos	After he out grew it she used it as a regular blanket, and still really liked it.
__label__pos	I love this system because it's so easy.
__label__neu	We put wet diapers in a seperate trash can (because they don't smell) and so we only put dirty diapers in the Diaper Champ so we only have to change the bag once a week and IT DOES NOT SMELL!
__label__neg	We started to put the nurserys together and when it came time to put these on they wouldnt fit.
__label__neg	Also,  this thing weighs a ton
__label__neg	Its not a lot bu it does do a small little bump on each end but only at the highest speed.
__label__neu	The bottle quality isn't great for the price.
__label__pos	The whales were a little disturbing and not my daughter's favorite, but the other three are great.
__label__pos	I found the stroller to be well- made and easy to steer.
__label__pos	Love this tub!
__label__neu	 So I bought it to save $10
__label__neg	"""I only wish the pacifier was not sewn in so I could switch it out when it falls on the floor without a waterfountain in site (having four or five froggys in an already crammed diaper bag isn't practical)."""
__label__pos	"""he is playing and kicking the water, which he has never done before.."""
__label__neu	They will stain if you don't care for them properly,  but washing them on the highest heat and little Shout gets the worst stains out every time
__label__neg	The corners have sufficient covers but why not the edges between corners??? 
__label__neu	A&D didn't irritate her either.
__label__pos	Someone gave me the Neat diaper disposal system for my baby shower & I absolutely loved it.
__label__neu	** This is the first and (at this time) the only review I have written
__label__neu	Within minutes,  however,  it became uncomfortable and then painful.
__label__pos	Great tub and worth every penny My son loves to take his baths in this since the sling makes him feel safe.
__label__pos	"""Do this with your average bottle a few times and be ready to say bye-bye to them, but Avent bottles hold on strong and in the process also happen to offer the best bibs in the market (the ones that best mimic the nipple, thus giving your baby the least gas, if you feed the bottle perpendicular to his/her mouth)."""
__label__pos	But we kept it anyway, my son still likes to play with it. 
__label__neg	"""It may be easy to put the infants in if they weigh less than 7 pounds because they are small but I had difficulty putting my baby in even when he was a newborn at 8 pounds."""
__label__neu	Our baby slept through the night since day one
__label__neu	She sleeps in this.
__label__pos	And it has excellent safety features.
__label__pos	I have had such good luck with this product that I'm already stocking up on them to give to girlfriends as shower gifts.
__label__pos	Glad I went with Original. 
__label__pos	Invest in fun---being a kid is not all learning spanish and english but also learning what fun is as well as cause and effect!!
__label__neg	 Rubber threads trailed from the top of one. 
__label__pos	She loved it as much as the waterfall and monkeys.  
__label__neu	I use one or both of them every day to keep the baby on for air time out of her diaper as well as when I have the baby with me on the bed or couch--even when the baby is diapered--just in case
__label__pos	Just ordered a few size small to replace the x- small my son is growing out of.
__label__pos	It's really a high quality product.
__label__neg	My child hates this toy.
__label__neu	If you're on a budget,  we'd recommend asking around for a safe baby bath tub like this one to borrow as we suspect most folks don't use them very long.
__label__neu	My son absolutely hated bath time until I bought the seat that sits in the bath tub and now he is happy
__label__neu	If you start your baby with warming his milk, then you're only getting him use to it. 
__label__neg	 Not impressed. 
__label__neu	"I HAD NO PROBLEMS BUT WHEN I BOUGHT MORE WHEN I GOT HOME,  I HAD NOTHING BUT LEAKY PROBLEMS!!! I EMAILED AVENT 2 TIMES AND THEY TOLD ME FIRST THAT I HAVE TO CALL THEM TO ""TALK ABOUT IT"" I SAID FORGET IT AND THEN I COMPLAINED AGAIN WHEN THE LEAKING KEPT HAPPENING."
__label__pos	The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because the only one you can have on a timer is the blue.
__label__neg	SUSPECT
__label__pos	Then it's a neat toy with the knob rattling around inside the cover
__label__neu	When I got the Chicco I immediately noticed a difference in quality.  
__label__neu	Large bright red toys appear to be an extremely faded pink,  and no other color is visible at all.
__label__pos	"""This cover puts me at ease."""
__label__pos	LOVE IT!!
__label__neg	1) they tend to leak if you don't assemble correctly,  and also if shaken or if the membrane becomes a bit worn
__label__neu	One day I filled it with scalding hot water (without my baby in it, of course) to see if it would change color and it didn't.
__label__neu	I purchased this in store and needed it for my 6 month old who wasn't crawling yet but rolled all over the place.
__label__neg	If I lived in the same state,  I would just bring it home to use in my house for my baby since we don't have any stairs.
__label__neg	There is no really reliable way to prop the legs that wouldn't possibly be slippery or unstable.
__label__neu	However, whenever he goes for something he shouldn't have he can always be distracted away by Sophie.  
__label__pos	"""He really loved it."""
__label__pos	The swing is a perfect shape to hold a small baby and the rocking side to side comforted my daughter like no other.
__label__neu	A Lactation Consultant suggested I pump between each feeding to up my supply, there was no way I could have done that with a manual.
__label__pos	Plus, it's pretty!
__label__neg	I researched bottles quite a bit when I became pregnant with my second child and although a lot of people complained about the leaking I decided to try the new BPA free bottles.
__label__neu	We received this carrier as a gift,  so we didn't have much input on the selection.
__label__neg	Well...we found absolutely no use for it. 
__label__pos	"""At first I overtightened it, and it wouldn't shut, so I loosened it and everything was fine."""
__label__neg	After staying in the freezer overnight, this teether stays cold for about 15 seconds.
__label__neg	If I had to choose between them I'd choose the moby.
__label__neg	I would have given it zero stars but the lowest is one.
__label__neu	I use it in a dark brown crib.
__label__neg	 This is particularly true if you price out the nipples, which are the only ones that fit their bottles
__label__pos	""":)"""
__label__pos	Overall another great product made by Fisher Price.
__label__pos	Great for travel.
__label__neg	To be fair we didn't have this for long
__label__pos	Easily secures to almost any chair.
__label__pos	I love the fact that the music isn't annoying.
__label__neg	 I actually called Fisher Price to tell them that this company, Blue Ridge, is giving Fisher Price a bad name
__label__neg	 We will look for another option, but until we find one, this cover is not the answer!
__label__neg	They have them in 3 sizes ,  with handles and they don't leak!
__label__neg	 Then she doesn't want to get off because her legs are numb and she gets scared. 
__label__neg	"""While easy to do, it is a bit cumbersome to open/close the gate, since you have to push a button while you lift the plastic handle, & then you have to lift the gate up as you push it open."""
__label__pos	We use the drop in liners and have had NO problems with leaks.
__label__neg	The Avent nipples are TOO HARD for a breastfed baby.
__label__neg	We have a kitchen aid oven with a thick rounded handle spanning the width of the door.
__label__neg	The downside of using the Avent system is that, once you commit, you're really committed - the bottles and bottle parts do not fit standard bottles and parts.
__label__neu	I chose these bottles admittedly because it's a well known brand.
__label__pos	or is pleasantly entertained while I am walking around (with child free hands).
__label__neu	The Diaper Champ uses regular size trash bags where the Diaper Genie requires special refills.
__label__pos	They replaced my bag for free.
__label__neu	We got this water mat when my twins were very small - 3 months maybe?
__label__neg	I installed it both as a single and also as a double and neither variation supported my sons head properly.
__label__neg	 She is too small for it and doesnt like to slumped over
__label__neg	Every baby is different and you've got to pick the system that works best for the both of you
__label__neg	The formula doesn't come out the way all of the books say it's supposed to, about a drop per second
__label__neu	No bulky towels that shift, no water noodles that get squished down.  
__label__pos	In the future this will be our shower gift to all our friends.
__label__neu	But,  I used the #1 nipple which takes my daughter 45 minutes to finish and she constantly falls asleep during feeding.
__label__pos	I have not had a problem with using these bottles on my older model of the medela pump.
__label__neg	But, it is SO hard to get the liquid out of through the straw.
__label__neu	If I'd been busy bathing my baby I would have tumbled into the tub with him.
__label__pos	It is not even that loud.
__label__neg	Got these for my baby shower & installed them in my car...they do not block the sunlight at all from the car--might as well have nothing there for all the good they do.
__label__neu	"""The first one was a different brand and used Velcro to keep it swaddled."""
__label__neu	But then we started putting her in her crib...
__label__neu	It greeted us on the porch of our house when we arrived home with the baby.
__label__neg	 Buyer beware
__label__neg	 Most books that I've read and my doctor agrees that it really isn't necessary to sterilize bottles
__label__neu	"""I bought this seat because my son wouldn't sit on the whole potty system we bought him."""
__label__pos	The chair was exactly what we were looking for.
__label__pos	Overall a solid and well designed gate but frustrating to assemble.
__label__neu	 I also have a snoogle pillow, and find that it works better alone, instead combined with the wedge
__label__neg	"""All in all, this is a horrible product!"""
__label__pos	: )
__label__neu	1
__label__neg	Our little whacked herself in the face with it once when she shook it and it scared the daylights out of her!  
__label__neu	I live in the subarbs and don't really get to much interference if any.
__label__neu	If you compare them with the Playtex (both the 4 oz and 8 oz),  the Wal-mart liners are smaller in circumference and will not hold as much.
__label__pos	It is safe and at the same time glides both on carpet and vinyl floor.
__label__neu	"""It has to be shut off manually."""
__label__neg	Well, having the extra bottles for pumping has been great and the work well in the freezer but they don't work well for feeding.
__label__pos	"""They are dishwasher safe though!"""
__label__pos	There is more than enough room for all of his foam letters and other bath toys.  
__label__neg	My baby's head falls to the side in this swing!
__label__neu	I was looking for a carrier for my little one that was sturdy and last for a while while allowing my little one to grow.
__label__neu	I bought one just to try to keep the pad a little bit more comfortable,  but it is so thin.
__label__neg	can't get it just right
__label__neg	I tried the avent first,  it's ok,  but I'm not fond of the plain look
__label__neu	I wish I thought more long term and purchased doorway gates instead.
__label__neu	I keep 4 diapers in it and then bought the Skip Hop Swipe wipe case and hooked it on to the diaper pod and put the changing pad in the back pocket. 
__label__neg	 The volume seems to be far too low in my opinion, although the static sure is loud
__label__pos	I was so excited to order this swing.
__label__neg	It is nice to use for snacks in the car but if not installed level the food does tend to roll into her lap
__label__neg	"""How much genius does it take to make a diaper pail this complicated."""
__label__neg	 It has voice activation
__label__neg	Here's a list of all that we found wrong with this bouncenette:*When our baby was a newborn, she wasn't properly supported by the seat, and would end up in very weird positions (head near the bottom of the seat, slumped over to the side, etc...) while sleeping.
__label__pos	His diapers have definately changed in odor but I have not noticed any odor coming from the Diaper Champ
__label__neg	I think I may try a different brand mirror this time
__label__neu	Do yourself a favor and stick with Gerber spoons or another brand
__label__neg	Also, the locking mechanism is too easy.
__label__pos	Out of all the products we bought, this one is my favorite.
__label__neu	My daughter got this when she was 3 and at 4 years old she still rides it all over the place, it spins in circles, sideways, back and forth.
__label__pos	"""Just hang them from the bar on their infant car seat and they will be entertained while you do small errands around the house or at the market."""
__label__pos	So far my son hasn't experienced any gas or spitup.
__label__pos	"""I like the boppy."""
__label__pos	if you're going to set this up and never take it down,  it's fine (once you initially get it put together,  that is
__label__pos	She loves to nap and play with her bouncer.
__label__pos	No hot spots as microwaves produce and you can even warm baby food jars in this as well.Only a few times I had put too much water in and the bottle had to cool before I fed my son.It's so quick and is perfect for feedings that every mom should own one, even if you think you'll breastfeed exclusively.
__label__neu	Email me at: Jul262003@yahoo.com
__label__neg	Maybe she just hates them and is fighting me on it. 
__label__neu	"A much safer option is the plastic ""Diaper Depot"" by Prince Lionheart."
__label__neg	Can't someone engineer a pouring system for these bags
__label__neu	Peg Perego also has a bigger basket.
__label__neu	My baby is 4 weeks old,  I have not yet used a thing from it
__label__pos	Pros:  Soft, warm, and cute. 
__label__neu	The changing pad is very small btw, my 2 month old doesn't fit on it very well anymore. 
__label__neu	They will leak,  but hardly in floods if our experience is any indication.
__label__pos	I love this monitor.  
__label__neg	This mattress pad is backed with plastic!
__label__neu	Now I am going to throw this one away and purchase through amazon the blue first years tub.
__label__neu	The tape keeps them from falling in the toilet and they are waterproof, for icky situations. 
__label__pos	While my daughter liked this,  the lights broke the first day,  and by the third day the motor was make grinding noises even with new batteries.
__label__pos	They are great for around-the-house everyday use.
__label__pos	"""Fabulous toy - worth the money - very durable."""
__label__pos	At first he protested for a while.
__label__neu	But, Oh My!... 
__label__pos	"""My daughter loves this car seat compared to a cheap seat that was our extra for the grandparents car until recently."""
__label__neg	I am not sure if it is because of this that the cup leaks.
__label__pos	The price was right.
__label__pos	"""We've been referring to our little guy as our ""Bun"", and there was even a label included ""bun in the oven""."""
__label__neu	What we didn't realize was that the foot pedal was how the ingenious airlock system works on the Elite
__label__pos	Also other playyards are uncomfortable- no wonder your baby screams to get out- the floors aren't thick enough and the support bars can be felt through the floor.
__label__neg	I thought this would be a great way to get my bottles clean but you still have to scrub them clean first yourself, THEN prepare this thing to stick in the microwave for x-amt of time, THEN wait for it to cool
__label__neu	I'd rather it not turn than her not see it at all.5.
__label__neu	I got them for the car so I don't have to reach back and get their cups every 5 minutes.
__label__pos	This is the only tub you need.  
__label__neg	 I stitched them back up, but it looks kind of cruddy and the material continues to unravel in new places
__label__neu	This is a HUGE FIRE HAZARD!
__label__neu	"""The Velcro didn't stick well for long."""
__label__neg	a bit of a pain when you are vacuuming one more thing to move but otherwise a great idea.
__label__pos	These are great for little ones, Once my daughter got a little older she became attached to her blanket and had to sleep with it, by that time she could roll over, etc. 
__label__pos	 and although you tell yourself you must be doing something wrong because no bottle should leak this much, it's not your fault
__label__neu	Nowhere in the description does it say that this gate should not be used at the top of the stairs
__label__neu	Yes,  it does give have good sound quality inside the child's room.
__label__neg	 It just didn't keep him in place and I was afraid with him moving around so much anyway, it may actually be dangerous. 
__label__neu	My daughter is rarely sleeping when we come home so there goes that good idea and when she is,  unfortunately she still wakes and wants out.
__label__neg	"""I don't have this model, but the one with the blue bubble shower cap, and it doesn't seem to matter when reading the other reviews of this model because the mildew problem is still the same!"""
__label__neu	I knew it was silly to spend so much on a teether, but I had tried so many other teethers and none of them worked. 
__label__pos	It is super light. 
__label__neg	I said like hell you wont. 
__label__neg	 I could never give her this cup without her shirt being soaked. 
__label__neg	 It may work if you have the thinner particle board cabinets, but it definitely didn't work through our solid wood cabinets
__label__neg	My 10 month old twins can wiggle these out - and they didn't even see me install/remove them
__label__neu	They have never leaked with me BUT I have never screwed the lid on too tightly.
__label__pos	there is no sleeping without it!
__label__neg	This was great,  until we put it in the dishwasher
__label__pos	 I thought it would be wonderful
__label__neg	Waste of money
__label__pos	With the baby safe feeder, your child knaws or sucks on the mesh and the food is dispensed in small quantities that are safe to be swalled by little mouths.
__label__pos	I love the boppy, when my back hurts it's the perfect way to nurse, baby loves to play on boppy!
__label__pos	They are LARGE, which is what I love best.
__label__pos	"""I got it fast and I loved it!"""
__label__pos	"""LOVE THEM!"""
__label__pos	This one is truly outstanding and so much more attractive than the set I had liked before.
__label__pos	Perfect height for me as well and plenty of storage room.
__label__neu	They are half the cost and never leak.
__label__neu	Unless you leave dirty ones in there for a few days.
__label__neg	It's a very useful item, but the quality of the fabric is terrible!
__label__neu	No mildew problems so far, and I just drain it and air-dry it after each use.
__label__pos	It was money well spent.
__label__neg	Too soft:  offers no support to keep baby's body in proper alignment.  
__label__pos	We had to give that one back and when our new baby was born we bought this and have road tested it with my 16 month old nephew he loves it as well and his parents are buying it for him and his new brother on the way.
__label__neu	I received this as a gift.
__label__pos	They are great to wear at home either at night or on weekends.
__label__neg	 But, when it has some stinky diapers in it, it stinks and so does her room. 
__label__neg	It broke the same evening I put it together
__label__neu	I can totally see the 3* ratings frustration until I figured out how to make him squeak.  
__label__pos	It is in the nursery and there is no smell at all. 
__label__pos	There are also delightful little fish swimming on the sides of this device
__label__neg	My only reservation about this carrier is that the color is dark, and the fabric is thick.
__label__pos	So far it's working they throw the cup or bowl and then just use the strap to pull it back.
__label__neg	" I wish I could return this item, but they won't take it back if your child just ""outgrew"" it"
__label__neg	However the thing REALLY stinks!
__label__pos	and since it is raised above the depot's wipes space it leaves room for any extra wipes that didn't fit inside the warmer.  
__label__pos	"""He wouldn't go near the old one with the big spash gaurd after he bumped up against it once."""
__label__neu	There's also a static-y quality that we didn't have the with FP model and it doesn't have nearly the same range as our old monitor (I could be out in the backyard and still get reception,  while this one sets off the range alarm inside the house).
__label__pos	I am so glad we bought this
__label__neg	It's not something where you can put a baby in right away and be on the go.
__label__neg	 I kept thinking he had leaked out of his diaper before I realized his sides were sweaty from this product.
__label__neu	If it was a big job,  I had to either pull a few of them out when I started chaning him or wait a few seconds before each wipe... a pain!
__label__neu	Much,  much better!
__label__neg	 I know not all kid's are the smae so your child might like them but I had to get rid of them
__label__pos	 electronic and a good brand- so what you pay 300
__label__pos	"""The songs are ncer than many of the items I had with my first son."""
__label__neg	It bends if you accidentally put all your weight on it, and it's hard to find that sweet-spot it was in before.
__label__pos	I love the fact that this pump is so portable! 
__label__neu	My advice: Don't waste your money.
__label__pos	I like that it is versatile and I will be able to use it not only for my newborn but as she gets older.  
__label__neg	I was shocked and then thought if I have not even used it and it does this I do not want
__label__neg	It doesn't hold very much and the top doesn't close like you think it should
__label__pos	And the smile helps with therapy. It's great.
__label__neg	After washing it as directed, it has gotten even worse.
__label__pos	We love this thermos and our toddler son does too.
__label__pos	The one- handed release of the tray and the highly adjustable settings are convenient options.
__label__pos	The hammock only really works with small/newborn babies.
__label__neg	 this is one of the things
__label__neg	I can't figure out why anyone would make a suction cup toy (presumably for use at a high chair, around food) that cannot be easily washed.
__label__pos	I only need one.
__label__pos	The gate was so easy to put together and fits perfectly at the entrance of her bedroom door.  
__label__pos	The Swaddler is great because you don't have to make a trifold out of a blanket and have them wriggle their way out of it after a few minutes. 
__label__neg	 It serves no purpose as a liner since its inefficiency to absorb (unlike microfiber), and cannot be used as a disposable/flushable liner
__label__neg	Other than the flashy colors, this toy is a bummer
__label__neg	 Every state has different laws regarding safety warnings, and unfortunately in NY state the stores do not have to remove items like this from the shelf unless it is officially recalled
__label__neu	Some babies will love it, but she tends to want something slightly softer- cold wash cloths do the trick often, as does the aforementioned rubber giraffe.
__label__neu	I bought this wanting to see my son in a rear-facing carseat
__label__pos	I like her because she's a great size lightweight very soft and smooth easy to wash and fun to play with (not just chew on).
__label__pos	This monitor is great.
__label__neu	I also let her (danger danger! )
__label__pos	When my son fusses or moves I can can hear him crystal clear over the music.  
__label__pos	I use it everyday.
__label__pos	These bottles were terrific along with a hypo- allergenic formula and these bottles she could actually eat without screaming in pain & sleep like a peaceful baby.
__label__pos	 Everything I need. 
__label__pos	I also recommend the Infantino Peek, Rattle and Teether if your baby likes this toy.
__label__pos	"""It signals my baby that its bedtime and keeps that jerk reflex from waking him up."""
__label__pos	works very well
__label__neg	It was not the same as the photo, but I was too lazy to contact Amazon about it.2.
__label__neg	 I emailed Blue Ridge to tell them about this issue
__label__neu	I used it in the swing, the activity rocker, the bouncer & in her stroller, but not her car seat.
__label__pos	The camera works great and the picture is clear.
__label__neg	 I cannot imagine using this with a smaller child. 
__label__neu	Besides you baby will probably poop only 1-2 times /day.
__label__neg	After four months I started having problems with my milk supply.
__label__neu	You can adjust the hight to fit different sizes of baby food jars. 
__label__neu	Note: I didn't buy this tub to fit into my kitchen sink.
__label__pos	Within minutes you have a perfectly warmed bottle for your baby.
__label__neg	"""In fact, my baby distinctly disliked it."""
__label__pos	"""It is very calming and now I use it for when she is sleepy."""
__label__pos	You will love it.
__label__neu	Our bedrooms and the baby's nursery are on the 3rd floor of our 5000 sq ft house.  
__label__neu	I was worried about what this white lock would look like on my black oven.  
__label__neg	We didn't even do anything to hurt the ring, sometimes if you just open the unit too roughly it will shear the edges and then it won't fit back in the top. 
__label__neg	Sometimes it's just 1 royal tune and sometimes it goes on playing tune after tune for who knows how long
__label__pos	The bright colors really hold his attention and I like that I can move the toys around to change his view.
__label__neg	 Even though you can't pump straight into them, sealing them is quick and easy
__label__neg	It hurt like heck and did not express enough milk to relieve my engorgement. 
__label__neg	They don't offer them on Babies R Us online but the do have them in the store.
__label__neu	I couldn't stand it!
__label__neg	 They also drip so if they are not sitting upright, they will leak water
__label__pos	Great gift idea for a nursing mother.
__label__pos	Definately worth AT LEAST $40.00.
__label__neg	 Still doesn't put my baby to sleep but he likes looking at it
__label__neg	 In addition to being slow, it began leaking while in use and this is only after being SPARINGLY used for 5 months
__label__pos	The colors just demanded that I order it--they are my favorites! 
__label__neu	It may fit better in a small car,  but I wouldn't know
__label__pos	 These saved me having to remove and wash my changing pad cover every time the baby did a #2 that escaped when I changed him - quite regularly
__label__neg	These bottles and nipples have been just a waste of money for us
__label__neu	I just wish they were available in a third size in between the smaller and the larger versions
__label__pos	"""Never had one stain, used them with beets, tomatoes, paint, food color, Easter egg dye, you name it (although after a few years, the white trim is just a little off-white now, but that is to be expected!)."""
__label__neg	"He is 37"" tall & 39 pounds."
__label__neu	I bought these for my newborn
__label__neg	 I was really happy with the seat up until I picked it up... 
__label__neg	 There is no way to wrap the legs tighter
__label__pos	"""Nature's Touch is the BEST!"""
__label__pos	"""I would highly recommend this toy!"""
__label__pos	I washed the mat in the washing machine and dried it on gentle many time without any problems.
__label__neg	The old lids were good the new lids don't let enough air back into the cup so after child has sucked for a few seconds the spout inverts back into the cup
__label__neg	I used it for several times but i didnt like it.
__label__pos	The sling seemed to work all right when my son was smaller,  but now he is 4 months and he loves to kick.
__label__neg	The real kicker of this was I was asleep one night while my husband was out working and I heard a males voice in the monitor. 
__label__neu	I rented the hospital (medela) pump for the first month until I was sure I could get my supply up and breastfeed (registering for it was too much pressure!). 
__label__neu	If I'm going to be out, not using wipes at home all day, I unplug the warmer--according to the directions.
__label__neu	The designs will not show up on dark walls and even if your ceiling is painted white, the images are still fuzzy. 
__label__pos	This lock is better than most of the locks on the market
__label__pos	My favorite blankets.
__label__neg	I have two of these changing pad covers and used them both for a year with my first child
__label__pos	This bag has lots of pockets, is well-made and is stylish so I know many moms would love this.
__label__neg	 save your money and get a more stable travel potty seat
__label__pos	Positives:Easy to install.
__label__neg	 And I don't know how many times I have scraped my fingers on the inside trying to push the dirty diapers into the diaper genie
__label__neg	"""Don't bother."""
__label__neg	 He refused these
__label__neg	 They are also more prone to getting lost and going down the disposal
__label__neg	" It is not as ""universal"" as it states"
__label__pos	"""he loves to go in there, get it completely dark and turn it on just to look at the stars and moon projections."""
__label__pos	Our daughter LOVES this toy.
__label__pos	"""She just used it as a seat on the big potty and it worked really well."""
__label__neu	I bought this diaper from Amazon on the recommendation of a friend and cloth-diapering guru- but I had no idea they were polyester! 
__label__neg	"""It's so much faster!!"""
__label__neu	I hang it on a drying rack and it's usually dry after a few hours
__label__pos	I got this pale b/c it was cheap.
__label__neu	I was looking for a lightweight stroller for vacations and all day events. 
__label__neg	only specified bags,  really messy and I see no point to doing this when you have a garbage can and hopefully you do not leave your garbage for a day or 2 in the house so when you take the garbage out,  you take the dirty diapers
__label__neu	There is this cloth that you put in the bottom that you have to make sure is always moist and you have to keep it moist with bottled or distilled water.
__label__neu	My Sister used this tub when she was in her apartment.
__label__neg	I agree with the other reviews, if you can find a cheaper version without the worthless plastic toys then get that one.
__label__pos	I used the regular Gerber bottles with my first Advent with my second and tried Advent & Soothie brand with my 3rd with no success.
__label__neu	If the thing is that cold, hold it in your hand for a few minutes.
__label__neu	It vibrates.4. 
__label__neg	What a waste!
__label__neg	It was very difficult to walk around with especially since my son was heavier than most babies his age
__label__pos	Great for a first chair!
__label__pos	I have since bought the Carter's brand bumper and I am happy. 
__label__neu	I discovered this while testing it empty and had to waste a bottle and nipple.
__label__neu	"""We bought the bottles to use with my son who is exclusively breastfed."""
__label__pos	"""He kicks his legs & coos like crazy."""
__label__neg	We returned it for a Graco Ultra CarGo.The arm rests on Coscos are a joke.
__label__pos	There are additional parts that need to be cleaned, but its well worth it!
__label__neg	So if you have the money to spend on a new 9V battery every night or every other night then I guess this monitor would be okay.
__label__neg	 We returned ours after a couple of weeks and got the Diaper Champ
__label__neg	 And now that my daughter is walking she flips the drum back and forth, you have to leave the room
__label__neg	Would not suggest.
__label__neu	Can't be 100% perfect, right? 
__label__neg	 It has completely different colors and the starfish is funky ... 
__label__pos	I love, love, love this swing, and I'll continue to use it, but I'm back here to buy a really light, cheap bouncy seat to easily travel with us from bathroom to kitchen to den etc.
__label__neu	The bottles leak horribly like everyone says they do.
__label__neg	I received this as a gift
__label__pos	"""Trasfer the formula to the Avent bottle and you'll avoid nipple confusion!"""
__label__neg	 However the fact you need to push the diaper through the pail's opening makes this product near worthless
__label__neu	"""You will save yourself considerable misery if you wear them in advance (but not too far in advance, or you can induce premature labor--talk to your obgyn)."""
__label__neu	I am hoping that with a few more washes they will become softer otherwise I would have given them a 5 star review.
__label__pos	Anyway, nice to have at least a couple in this set to use on bottles I already had.
__label__neu	I haven't had any problems with mildew and it is machine washable. 
__label__neg	It is designed for cribs with a drop rail and so it comes in two pieces - one piece for the moveable side of the crib (the one that drops),  and a larger piece that covers the other 3 sides.
__label__neg	It was always getting in the way and I was having to fold it up so that I could see what I was doing when folding it
__label__neg	I called the company to try and order those lids separately, but they do NOT!
__label__pos	Our 3- month- old has been using these bottles since he was one month old.
__label__neg	 I only recieved this pump - no electrical one and I wanted 2 diiiiie
__label__neg	My son (11 months) can easily reach in with his whole fist and grab a handfull of snacks and subsequently scatter them everywhere.
__label__neg	Once the baby is in there he/she is stuck until someone takes him out.
__label__neg	I wish I had just bought a used or cheaper bouncer
__label__pos	This one has nice music (ok...it is not the best music ever, but he's a baby and it is calming enough) and the screen makes lovely light pictures for him to look at.So far...this mobile has been great!
__label__neu	I think this pillow may work for some,  yet not for me.
__label__neg	 I did try using the second stage nipple and the formula comes out far to fast and my son won't have anything to do with it at this point
__label__neg	If you do decide to go against this rating, please keep your receipt.  
__label__pos	"""I feel this is one of those special things - most people haven't found yet, or don't know about."""
__label__neg	 It's not easy to squeeze the air out
__label__pos	 If you're willing to go that extra mile, this seat works great.
__label__pos	the best part.
__label__pos	These are the perfect size for my 6 month old's hands.
__label__neg	 Twice
__label__neg	"""Went out and bought a springs-based baby mattress from one of the big-name brands and we have been using relatively happily since."""
__label__neu	My daughter loved it,  but the song was so short.
__label__pos	This toy reminds me of the kind of stuff I had and loved as a baby.
__label__pos	Well worth the money.
__label__pos	It was very simple to assemble, I didnt even need my husband for help.  
__label__pos	This works great. 
__label__pos	He does not like riding in the car without this mirror
__label__neg	We use them now as extras for the car.
__label__pos	I'll be buying more!
__label__pos	Best out there on the market!
__label__pos	We have never had leakage problems.
__label__neg	too big/too small
__label__pos	It fits older style cribs but not sleigh types
__label__pos	With all the different levels in our house, I was concerned that it may not function in some areas, however so far, I have had no problems.
__label__neu	They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.
__label__pos	Much more cost efficient and useful!
__label__neu	You have 5 settings to choose from for the speed and suction.
__label__pos	so far so good
__label__neg	"""I only gave it 4 stars because it's looking kinda haggered."""
__label__neu	The musical sounds don't sound like the real instruments,  they just sound like a cheap toy.
__label__pos	You can take the sheet off easily by just removing the snaps attached around your crib slats.
__label__pos	The fleece cover is the best too.
__label__neg	The bottles did not come with rings so I have to use the rings from other bottles to use the bottle to feed my daughter. 
__label__neu	"""pour in water, add rack of bottles, put on lid, press button."""
__label__neu	"""Okay, I got this for newborn."""
__label__pos	She likes it and so do I!
__label__pos	awesome for first time parents.
__label__neg	I don't want to read any other reviews besides mine of a baby falling from this carrier.
__label__neu	I haven't had any problems with leakage (with this or any other brand) but after 3-4 washes the Medela pads are so wrinkled and have lost their shape that I can't wear them with anything without them showing through.
__label__pos	This sling is the best purchase I made
__label__neu	It dug into mine
__label__neu	The instruction manual is something like 25 pages long and is very difficult to understand.
__label__pos	I bought portable crib sheets at Babies R Us and they work great.
__label__pos	Several reviews complain about features of this warmer, but I think it is wonderful.  
__label__pos	Overall I think Playtex has the best bottles and nipples.
__label__neu	to clean
__label__neg	And the worst one is that the plastic star valve keeps coming off, which requires taking it apart in the middle of pumping,while its leaking everywhere. 
__label__neu	Makes me want to further decorate the room for the baby.
__label__pos	For time and energy saving convenience, highly recommended!
__label__neu	But it is definitely NOT waterproof.
__label__neg	 I expected better quality for the high price.
__label__neu	 Babies naturally sleep on their backs if placed that way. 
__label__neu	The music in this is POOR,  VERY VERY POOR!!!! It sounds like cheap  crap and I am disappointed cause I had really expected more.
__label__neg	I used the Avent disposables which are the absolute best,  so I thought their washables would be good as well.
__label__neg	Again,  the directions are of absolutely no help
__label__pos	It's secure, it doesn't wobble.
__label__pos	"""Overall, we are very pleased with the value of the product for the price."""
__label__neg	 At about 6 1/2 months, I ditched it and bought a bath chair
__label__pos	In comparison, The stuffing on the Boppy my sister loaned us was pretty flat after she used it for only one child.You can even use it standing up or when you move around since the strap goes around your back.
__label__pos	"""It had great music and sound options and the seating was very comfortable and flexible!"""
__label__pos	These came out the winner in my book, mostly because even without the assistance of fabric softener, there came out far softer than the premium prefolds.
__label__neu	 Finally we spent the extra money for an Amazing Miracle Blanket
__label__neg	This seat is not at all sturdy.
__label__neu	If you are trying to remove it while holding a baby,  forget it,  you will need 2 hands.
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	He's in it as we write this.
__label__neg	My parents bought theMommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Tushie Potty Seatand I think it's much comfier,  much easier to clean AND it's only $10
__label__pos	I used to put it on the floor an he liked it right away.
__label__neg	This thing is very hard to figure out. 
__label__neg	I put the harness on the lowest setting and it's way above her shoulders still.
__label__neu	"Most importantly,  the gate was not very tall,  only about 24"" I think,   The railing around the top of the steps is more like 32""."
__label__neg	"""Personally, I don't find that there's much to look at - the flat lighted pictures that spin around are nothing compared to the three-dimensional, moving fish and real bubbles in the Ocean Wonders Aquarium (my daughter's very favorite crib toy)."""
__label__neu	For the most part I really haven't had any problems with it.
__label__neg	All it does it says the colors and lights up with different tunes.
__label__neu	You can get them direct from this seller for the same price with an extra insert.
__label__neu	The designers apparently sacrified the 'adjustable' feature of the gate in order to make it both pressure- and wall-mounted.
__label__neg	I would never reccommend these bottles to anyone
__label__pos	I loved the fact (and still do) that it has a spray.
__label__neu	It is extremely easy to fill with water, add formula, mix and then toss the pitcher in the fridge - it takes about a minute.  
__label__pos	The rails come off easily for cleaning, and the stool can be moved easily just by squeezing the two rails together and picking it up.
__label__neg	 Yeah, it's cool that it heats up and all, but boiling the thing for 10 mins to get it back to its gel state sucks
__label__neg	 What aggravated me the most though, was just how hard it was to get ALL the soap off his body
__label__pos	I replaced the silicon nipples that are included with the bottles with this rubber nipple and she finally drinks from the bottle and still breastfeeds whenever I am home. 
__label__neg	Baby only likes it slightly.
__label__pos	My son plays with it all the time, and chews on it when he gets the urge.
__label__neg	The only problem I've found with it was when my sister-in-law put my 2 year old nieces diaper in there and the smell lingered a bit.
__label__neu	but once i noticed the straps could snap completely off.. 
__label__pos	"""Highly recommended baby product!"""
__label__neu	"""Absolutely, but you're going to pay for the difference."""
__label__pos	This toy is on the expensive side but I have to say that it is really worth it!
__label__neg	The motor cycles very slowly so when it's tugging on me all I can think is ouch...ouch...ouch... 
__label__neg	Despite following the instructions to a tee,  the bottles NEVER came out perfect
__label__neu	However,  the cloth on this organizer sags.
__label__neu	One Boppy Nursing Pillow became surplus, although I continued using it for bottle-feeding the baby for the next six months, I might add. 
__label__pos	The greatest thing about The First Years Clean Air Systen is that it can store about 6-7 days of my son's diapers without NO yucky odors.
__label__neg	Needless to say, they haven't been used.
__label__neu	It's a bit of work to wring the water out,  and you never get it all out.
__label__neu	After breastfeeding my son,  I decided to use the Playtex Nursers for bottlefeeding.
__label__neg	It only reads ONE temperature which is 77 degrees!!
__label__neu	The little pillow head rest/support is useless right now, and is actually a nuisance (we tuck it under the hammock) but maybe when he gets bigger, it'll come in handy. 
__label__pos	One of my baby's faves!
__label__neg	I was disappointed with this product when I went to install it on my seats
__label__neg	I just wish it fit smaller openings also.
__label__pos	"""Of all the different bottles we tried, our son took to these the best."""
__label__pos	The seat is plush & comfortable with a colorful fish pattern.
__label__neu	We even put the monitor in the window and it still didn't get the reception.
__label__pos	"""These bowls are great!"""
__label__neu	I had this un-neccessary nursery item thinking that my November born baby would be more comfortable... boy was I wrong.
__label__pos	WOW!
__label__neg	 It's a waste of money all around
__label__neu	Besides, this model doesn't cost any more than the one without a night light.When we are out, obviously my baby gets treated with cold wipes, but at home we always change her in her nursery with warm ones.
__label__pos	It is actually better that the joints don't move so easily so that your child cannot change the shape of the play yard when they push against it.
__label__pos	Nothing has broke or worn out.
__label__pos	"""It works the best of anything I have used so far."""
__label__neu	At nine months she still plays in it
__label__neg	 In the beginning, we used the infant sling, but my baby would constantly slip down into the water. 
__label__neu	The Sunshine Radian is different!  
__label__pos	 My daughter loves sticking her hand in the bowl to make it play the song and she loves taking the bowl out. 
__label__neg	I ordered this seat but we are having to return it because it doesn't fit in the '02 Mercury Sable, or the '03 Sable.
__label__neu	Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag,  but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.
__label__pos	I keep my warmer by the changing pad, and I always have very warm, moist wipes to tend to my baby...just like a gentle wash-cloth!
__label__pos	This is a beautiful piece of equipment.
__label__neu	It keeps her occupied for long periods of time and she's learning the names of each instrument and how they each sound both together in an orchestra and individually.
__label__pos	 I bought the deluxe first for my changing area and its been great
__label__neg	This potty is driving me crazy
__label__neg	The thermometer function in this tub worked for about 5 baths, not it is completely out of order and alarm starts to sound at temperature 85 (measured with another thermometer) showing that it is over a 100
__label__neg	If you do not have corners in your bathroom, don't bother with this because it will not work with rounded off tub/showers.
__label__neu	Um,  no.
__label__neu	If you like sturdy, high thread count and a thick uniform cloth, get the Gerber premium prefolds.
__label__neu	I purchased this alongside renting a hospital grade pump
__label__neu	I really really need divided travel plates with lids
__label__pos	I would recommend Dr Brown's to anyone and after awhile washing the bottles/extra parts becomes second nature and really isn't so bad when your babies are happy & healthy.
__label__neu	I thought maybe my baby was just having problems with taking a bottle,  so I went and bought the Playtex VentAire
__label__neu	 Sure this is a nice pail to keep after the diapers are gone. 
__label__neg	It was okay for the first week,  but then my son started to slide up or down and would not even be on it by the time he woke up,  which defeated the purpose
__label__neg	I contacted Tiny Love and they sent me replacement parts,  but it still didn't work
__label__pos	basically everyone that sees it loves it.
__label__neu	This thing kind of just slide latches into place and offers no real security.
__label__pos	This mobile provides adorable rainforest animals that actually face down so my daughter does not have to simply look at animal bottoms.
__label__neu	Junior seems to appreciate the extra warmth and room  I'd say the wrap is more effective and harder for him to get out of.
__label__neu	It was horrifying!
__label__neg	They weren't soft like the others either.
__label__pos	my son got this toy for christmas and was too young for it,  but i brought it out when he was 6 mos old and he absolutely loved it
__label__neu	Our daughter has some serious suction,  so I thought that the Stage 1 was already outgrown and tried the 2
__label__neg	The only 2 points I am giving to it - it gives great support to my back when I sit - I am experiencing some lower back pains during my pregnancy,  and for that purpose it is great.
__label__neg	It's a great concept, just not practical.
__label__neu	My baby just doesn't seem to chew on things for teething relief. 
__label__pos	They fit well, aren't noticable, and won't leak.
__label__neg	4) No valve except in the cup spout.
__label__pos	The pros.1)  No drilling required.
__label__pos	Even my mother- in- law stated wow this really works as she was rocking her granddaughter to sleep.
__label__neu	worth of formula that this one does.
__label__pos	i found these online and they're great!
__label__neg	 This one is terrible to put together
__label__neu	If you are in the market for a carrier,  go for the Bjorn.
__label__pos	Very comfortable and roomy.
__label__neg	 Suffication waiting to happen
__label__neg	It's so quiet I can't tell
__label__pos	"""These are great toys to entertain your new baby."""
__label__neg	 I also felt that the pillow did not support my belly very well because it is so thick-I felt uncomfortable with it under me
__label__neu	"""There are some 'extra' accessories to this set, not all are carried by in the store at Babies R Us or are on Amazon.."""
__label__neu	We still have this in the back of the car for those rare emergencies.
__label__neg	 Quite honestly, I'm not sure what Boppy is thinking on this one
__label__pos	The stroller folds up fine
__label__pos	Yes, I have the usual collection of other brands of storage containers but I like the sturdiness of these.
__label__neg	We wanted pressure mounted gates but I was concerned that the opening of this particular gate would not be wide enough for my husband.
__label__pos	The sheets wash well too which is a nice plus.
__label__neg	We have yet to find something that this toy will clip too. 
__label__neu	"""If anyone is having problems with there child- reguardless of age-- lactching on or nipple soreness or whatever......"""
__label__neg	"""The seat does not swivel easily!"""
__label__neg	"""It is also time consuming and cumbersome to put on."""
__label__pos	"""I admit it: I am impressed with Avent bottles!"""
__label__pos	Also that idea has always made me very antsy so the idea of a free- standing jumper made me feel much safer.
__label__neu	We started using cold fruit to soothe her gums but even without teeth she managed to break of chunks and I'd have to pry open her mouth to fish out the pieces.
__label__pos	The way it's shaped is perfect for his little hands and mouth.  
__label__pos	This is a wonderful toy for young babies.
__label__neg	$20 wasted for me!
__label__pos	Overall these are the best bottles on the market.
__label__neu	I put this swing together in 15 minutes.
__label__pos	It is a lifesaver.
__label__pos	Great pump!
__label__neu	For example,  the horn would play the background,  the flute a lighter melody,  then all the instruments would combine to create the true melody when the orchestra button is pressed.
__label__pos	"""I will consider renting it if I have low milk supply problem but I would not spend the money on the Medela pump."""
__label__pos	This really does keep the smell in.
__label__neg	 It is the product itself that is defective
__label__pos	"From the time I hung it up, at around 7-8 weeks, she was mesmerized by it, and now at 12 weeks she giggles and ""talks"" to the flowers."
__label__neg	"""then after she started solid, I somehow ""forgot"" about this item..."""
__label__neu	I like to use reusable washable nursing pads at home, since they are softer than disposables & more comfortable.
__label__pos	As this type of pacifier is difficult to impossible to find in major retail stores or local drug stores,  I ordered it from Amazon and had prompt service with great communication
__label__neu	I think I wasted my money on this product.
__label__neg	They sometimes leak and it's really difficult to heat the milk inside because the plastic is too tick
__label__pos	She LOVES the sounds and lights.
__label__neg	If you want to avoid disappointment,  definitely buy the more expensive brand
__label__neg	I prefer the Kiddopotamus though because I don't have to put her arms through the sleeves when she's asleep which usually wakes her up.
__label__pos	With this stroller - she jumps right on for the ride through the parking lot, or sits when she has had enough walking. 
__label__neg	 I couldn't get our baby aligned properly which was very stressful just starting out nursing. 
__label__neu	except that the routine my husband and I developed was that I always ended up carrying the baby and he always carried the diaper
__label__pos	This solves our problem.
__label__pos	I decided to go ahead and quit being stingy on my part and get them for my daughter what a lifesaver!
__label__neu	The assembly of this dresser is a mind game of the worst type: missing pieces,  deceptive drawings in instruction manual,  etc.
__label__pos	I do not have to worry of SIDS with my newborn. 
__label__neu	So my wife and I purchased this ultra-convenient frame/stroller for convenience.
__label__neg	As she neared 8 weeks old, she learned to find comfort in a pacifier and would accept sitting there with a pacifier to sleep.
__label__pos	We actually went out and bought a second gate when we saw how great they are.
__label__pos	It really makes the newborn baby comfortable and easy to carry without a lot of blankets.
__label__pos	That in it and of itself makes this worth so much more than I paid for it as far as I am concerned.
__label__pos	I also have to wait for my daughter's teeth before I test the toothbrush but it's nice that I have everything handy already.
__label__neu	He may scratch himself down there
__label__pos	I don't know what I would've done without it because it comes with a net to place newborns in.
__label__neu	He can't sit on is own yet,  so has to lay on the sling.
__label__neg	 What a difference
__label__neg	I registered and received this monitor as a shower gift
__label__pos	"""Comfortable for mother and baby."""
__label__neu	We ended up ordering the Fisher Price Tape Player online and it is really wonderful.  
__label__pos	I call the swing my baby sitter,  it is fantastic.
__label__neg	My back started to hurt after 5 minutes walking with my 9 lbs baby!
__label__neu	I have used them for only a couple months (have a ten month-old who didn't start solids until 5 months
__label__neg	I personally found it a little busy and there was only one, when I have 2 windows in my baby's room.
__label__pos	As a tech of seven years, I would not hesitate to recommend this seat or use it for my own child.
__label__neg	Now it smells like a diaper and she only makes #2 every other day and I empty the Genie at least one a week.
__label__neu	The inside gets  horrible smell like something died in it.
__label__pos	It folds up nicely & we stored it under the bathroom sink. 
__label__pos	They are a perfect paint tray for my children while they are sitting at the table and painting on paper. 
__label__neu	We've had it up all day and the dogs jump on it with no problem.  
__label__neg	I found this stroller to be a piece of junk!
__label__pos	"""We started using it when our baby was 6 months old, and she had no problems fitting in it, or sitting in it."""
__label__pos	I love these keepers-my five month old takes Soothies as well as Playtex Orthos; when using with the Soothies, I find the penguin and the bee style both to be a little big and kind of in the way, but he loves the penguin because he can grip it and pop the pacifier in and out of his mouth. 
__label__pos	This is the ONLY tub I would recommend!
__label__pos	I don't use these as wipes but they're great for wash cloths.
__label__neg	 The wipes stay warm once unplugged for about an hour only, and it's way too big for a travel case
__label__neg	"Both the ""lock"" and the paint came off the closet door."
__label__pos	Great gate for younger children/pets.
__label__pos	This was fine though,  I planned to use it on our kitchen counter
__label__neu	We tried every single bottle on the market and the only bottle that she will take is the Playtex Deluxe Nurser
__label__neg	 She'll sit on it, but it's so small
__label__neu	it has a drain too.
__label__neg	"""The smell wears off a bit after a few washes but still kinda there."""
__label__pos	 Both are jumpers which I know any kid would love
__label__pos	It is light weight, fits easily in my tiny trunk and my daughter seems happy in it.
__label__neg	"""We went to all of the major retailers, and I was shocked at the terrible quality of the bedding--the sheets with characters (Lightning McQueen, Thomas the Tank Engine, Dora) were consistently made of sheets that were see-through and felt like plastic or sandpaper."
__label__pos	Plus it wipes up very easily it covers her entirely and its a cute print.
__label__pos	I get compliments all the time on this
__label__neg	I don't think it works right.
__label__pos	It plays really nice, soothing music along with nature sounds.
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	"""i use the other two frequently when packing her food to go."""
__label__neu	"My son is 3'3"" & 30 pounds"
__label__neg	3) Top heavy - it wants to fall over and has fallen over multiple times4) The lid does not want to latch half the time
__label__neu	I purchase it for my baby.
__label__neg	It is very difficult during the first few times you open and close it.
__label__neu	"""It is so sensitive we can even hear the babies breathing- the reception is crystal clear."""
__label__pos	This pillow is great for sitting your baby on your lap or for letting him nap on your lap. 
__label__neg	We barely even use it anymore because it it not too convenient when you have a hungry baby waiting for her bottle.
__label__neu	Save your money ladies
__label__neu	I do NOT like the warmer, but the organizer is fine.
__label__neu	No it is not meant for travelling and the mat is perfectly thick enough even on my hardwood floors.
__label__neg	I agree with the other poster who said this needs to be recalled
__label__pos	All in All, I think the paci's are great, the rest of it I could do without
__label__neg	The baby isn't due for a little while but I washed these in preparation
__label__pos	The armholes also fit nicely without being too wide.
__label__neg	I still have the damn thing. 
__label__neu	"""I nursed our son for about 7 weeks without this, like many mothers, slouching and what not was killing my already injured back, a friend of mine had one and i tried it..."""
__label__neg	 It just took up a great deal of space in the bed and was too hard and thick to use under my head. 
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	It arrived today and my daughter loves the bugs and the soft playmat
__label__pos	It worked fine for us semi-closed for a few months but once my daughter started crawling she refused to stay in such a confined space for more than a few minutes at a time.
__label__neg	Avent sippy cups are hard to hold difficult to drink from when the cup is not filled to capacity a pain to clean and worst of all they leak.
__label__pos	It's so easy to use!!
__label__neu	I registered and recevied these baskets for my baby shower. 
__label__neg	 If you don't put it in properly after washing, the formula will leak from the bottom of the bottle
__label__pos	I bought this carrier before my son was born and it worked great for almost two months
__label__neg	4 GHz devices around the house
__label__neu	When I went back to work after 5+ months of maternity leave, my baby had no interest in drinking from a bottle. 
__label__neu	"There is a line on the bottle that says not to fill above and also for travel they provide a ""travel disc"" to fit under the nipple to prevent leaks so I am not sure how other people have all these problems.  "
__label__neu	If you want a less complex way to carry your baby,  go to [...] and check them out.
__label__pos	"""And you know what- my daughter does like it!"""
__label__pos	A great product!
__label__neu	Brown bottles
__label__neu	 I will give these to my daughters to play with their dolls
__label__pos	But overall this toy is pretty safe if you are there to supervise and well worth the $40 to see you child bouncing away.
__label__pos	In fact, I think they have even gotten softer.
__label__neg	Definently didn't work for me,  sent it back the next day
__label__neu	it is electrical and works both from batteries and electricity. 
__label__neu	The velcro attaches acress of the chest/arm area even though there is tons of space for growth at the feet.
__label__pos	I ordered this mattress mainly because I love how light the foam mattresses are. 
__label__neg	Followed the instructions re: cleaning with alcohol and drying... several times.Subway tile.Flat.Clean.Not crossing grout lines.
__label__pos	"""It was a pain in the butt."""
__label__neu	I like the feature that it only goes on when your baby moves or makes a noise because you know exactly when your baby is moving
__label__pos	Don't get anything else!
__label__pos	Pleased with width of opening
__label__neu	I originally bought another type of dishwasher basket that had the bottle nipple compartment on top, but it much more difficult to use. 
__label__pos	I like this wrap a lot and I am really into baby-wearing.
__label__neu	I have never used the remote so I can't comment on it.
__label__neg	 Its not easy putting it on or taking it off
__label__neu	I fell in love with this play yard,  because it's just so much prettier than most others.
__label__neg	I primarily breastfeed and the shape of these nipples are nothing like mine.
__label__pos	Because of the liners, it is easy to keep two of these bottles in use and not clutter up the kitchen with bottle pieces, etc.
__label__neu	This carrier was not for us.
__label__pos	"""I also have the regular bottles, too, for home."""
__label__neu	He started out laying on his back and just watching the lights.
__label__neu	we hang it from his play gym to keep it interesting.
__label__neu	I bought this because my back & belly need some support while sleeping
__label__pos	Best Seat Ever!
__label__neu	When my little girl is sleeping in it she will usually sleep anywhere from an hour to three hours at a time.
__label__pos	"""this is definitely a MUST have item."""
__label__neu	Since these are two popular brands,  I wish they'd note that on the Amazon site and more prominently on the box!
__label__neu	I want mine to last,  and using the dryer tends to wear them out
__label__pos	I own this one in green and love it. 
__label__neu	After reading all the reveiw on this,  I believed I HAD to have this tub.
__label__pos	So if you have the same situation - these are the laundrysaver :))
__label__neu	I just buckle in my daughter and then zip her up and off we go. 
__label__neu	Some reviews noted it offers little or no back support for the person carrying the baby.
__label__neg	 I should have read more into it
__label__pos	Our baby loves the animals.
__label__neg	It's very soft and fuzzy, and you can pick four different soothing sounds.
__label__neu	(You can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby.)
__label__neu	Especially for 1st time parents!  
__label__neu	"""I purchased sheets for the Graco Pack-N-Play as well as other custom size sheets several times in different colors and prints."""
__label__neg	would not recommend this product
__label__pos	""":)"""
__label__neu	I've heard also that the Original is better than the Advanced. 
__label__pos	I like that since it sits on the top corner of the tub, my son can reach in it on his own and grab the toys he wants out of it.  
__label__pos	Great foot and hand finder
__label__pos	I will definitely use this tub again for our next newborn!
__label__neu	You can wear this carrier with the baby facing you or facing out.  
__label__neu	 I am going to look for a cushioned potty chair next and hopefully we have more success.
__label__pos	"""she constantly played with it."""
__label__neg	In experimenting with other bottles she now refuses it because the milk flow is so slow.
__label__pos	That makes bath time so much easier.
__label__neg	Don't waste your money or time on the gym.
__label__neg	On hot summer days, I can't use it because it will overheat the baby.
__label__neg	I can only find the tray toys online at the Graco website, but they give you no description.6.
__label__neu	Whew
__label__pos	This swing has so much more than I expected!
__label__neu	I purchased the Select-a-Show-Soother for my 6 month old Grandson. 
__label__pos	Yes you have  the bags,  but there is no leaking and no extra air
__label__pos	I liked that it could be folded, but I never actually put it away unless we have company since I use it daily.
__label__neg	 Well, messy diapers sometimes left a bit of a mess in the opening area, and it was not easy to clean
__label__neu	Both were huge and bulky.  
__label__neu	My son's room smelled very badly,  even when I changed the pail every day.
__label__neu	he likes it when we put bits of food on his high chair tray so that he can pick them up and eat them himself
__label__neg	How are you supposed to know if it will fit unless you purchase it?
__label__neu	I also doubt any child/baby would be happy being confined in it for longer than 10 minutes.
__label__neu	I would have to say that this is the worst tub ever!
__label__neg	This will not stick to my tile because it is painted
__label__pos	 The Lansinoh bag is strong as well, easy to close (DOUBLE zip-lock Vs. 
__label__neu	This worked for my son's first bath then he was too big for it
__label__pos	Cover is easy to clean, just pop it off. 
__label__neu	I bought this after my agonizing for my first child born in February....
__label__neg	Don't buy this product -- it's not worth the frustration and annoyance.
__label__neu	I bought this before my daughter was born thinking that the 'heartbeat' sound would be soothing for her. 
__label__pos	they are easy to use, large enough to fill up a good amount of snacks that will last few hours of play.
__label__neu	It's not very soft & cushiony (but hey, neither is our daughter's papasan swing and she's been napping comfortably in that thing for 7 months!
__label__neg	Don't bother with bulky snowsuits.
__label__pos	It is easy to clean and is one less thing to worry about. 
__label__neu	My kid even eats out of it when it drops down there. 
__label__neu	The Carter's waffle blankets worked better for us and are a better value because they can be used for other purposes as well. 
__label__neg	So,  she's getting rewarded for sitting there and not forming the reward association with doing something in the potty
__label__neu	What a mistake!
__label__neu	I thought it was a must-have,  and the best of the best,  so I spent $119 on it
__label__neg	We bought this for her when she was around 6 months old or so and she has never played with it.
__label__pos	For the price it did exactly what it was supposed to do.
__label__neu	Changing the Diaper Champ really isn't a pleasant experience.
__label__neg	I had the bottle inside (supposedly being warmed up) for nearly 30 minutes and nothing.  
__label__neu	not bulky, the stickies work great, but I imagine in time they may not stick (that's usually the case with most of these cushions).
__label__neu	Evenflo Classic 4 oz
__label__pos	This pillow also helps keep me snuggly and warm which helps my arthritis too.
__label__pos	I like how it's covered in smooth vinyl so we can clean it very easily.
__label__pos	Item arrived in good condition and quite fast.
__label__neu	We have the boppy changing pad cover and these liners.
__label__neg	 There is a metal rod in the hinge that is rusting on the large mesh rack. 
__label__neu	haba is my favorite wooden toy brand. 
__label__neu	"We kept it anyway,  but had to ""rig"" it ourselves by locking the straps in with our own invention"
__label__pos	With this sling, you get this lovely effect where the belt part goes below the belly and the crossover cinches itself to your chest after any length of wear.
__label__neu	"They won't actually say ""BPA Free"".  "
__label__neg	This product seemed like it would work so well,  but in reality it is terrible
__label__neu	For me,  it's easier to just carry my baby rather than put him in this.
__label__neu	I generally wear him in it around the house when I am trying to get things done and for short outings.  
__label__neg	Don't waste your money.
__label__neg	It simply wasn't worth anything since the other brand cost about the same and was more durable.
__label__pos	plus you can take it to restaurants without it being a pain.
__label__neg	After a few days I was tired of wrestling with 15 feet of fabric and then it was hot
__label__pos	which worked much nicer with my play yard.
__label__neu	One thing I did notice was that after I put it together, my 2yr old daughter happened to be watching, she immediately knew how to open the gate!
__label__neu	I use them when pumping.
__label__neg	they do kinda change color when I used Similac powder formula, not cows milk though.
__label__pos	These pads have definitely come in handy.
__label__neg	THE BAD*Too bulky:: Even with directions, I found the Moby tedious to handle and tie due to its bulk and length.*Thick material:: The material wasn't very breathable due to the thick cotton.
__label__neg	YOur baby won't die of hypothermia if you don't have a wipe warmer.
__label__neg	I got Snuggli and Bjorn for my baby shower
__label__pos	Has the spinny things which Ella loves the light up music bus which shes still trying to push but she loves lights and music and so much more if they get bored they just need spin for new toys lol highly recommended best stationary there is out there!
__label__neg	The nipples leak very little when the bottle is inverted,  but when feeding,  the flow is very fast (too fast,  much faster than a Playtex fast flow nipple).
__label__pos	 It is her favorite car toy
__label__pos	I am a stay-at-home mom who breastfeeds but this product is still worth its weight in gold
__label__neg	We had to order non-toxic urethane just for this rail because non-toxic urethane is not carried in any of the local hardware stores,  and then we had to stay up nights to do all the work of sanding,  painting,  sanding,  painting
__label__neg	Maybe when he's older, it won't bother him as much.
__label__neu	Do not get it if you plan on folding it up.
__label__neg	Too hard. 
__label__neg	 It would not work when I took it out of the packaging so I checked the batteries and they were corroded
__label__pos	Since our baby was born, we have puthim in it to soothe him and it has beengreat watching him swing and grow into it.
__label__neu	my son would fall asleep in it,  then we'd move the boppy to his bed,  and pancake scoop him out onto bed,  easy transition
__label__neg	 She didn't even really want to play with it as a toy
__label__neg	It was really heartbreaking. 
__label__neu	What I liked about it was the modern design the fact that it is not made entirely of plastic and at least in theory the possibility of using it with your iPod - which never worked for us SMILEY.
__label__pos	very useful
__label__pos	"Yes.I am fairly short (5'4"") and have absolutely no problem with the height of the handles."
__label__neg	"""but by the time my babies hit 12-13 lbs, this carrier became uncomfortable for me, pulling on my shoulders and causing me to arch my lower back - not good!"""
__label__neg	Spend your money on a better one.
__label__neu	it's provided hours of entertainment and ranks up there with the kick n'play bouncer in terms of usefulness.
__label__neg	I used the diaper genie with my first son and was not impressed
__label__neu	I went back and forth about purchasing this item and decided to go for it.
__label__neg	These blankets are a little too warm since it is a flannel-type material.
__label__pos	There is no upside-down to this toy.
__label__neg	We could have done that with toys she already had. 
__label__neg	we never really used it because just holding them in your had for  a minute really does the trick and you can save the twenty dollar item on something you really need and something that is actually useful. 
__label__pos	The advantage here is it fits the 5 pt. harness to 80 lbs.
__label__pos	A good product that I would recommend to others with curious tots running around
__label__neg	 My baby is only a month old and im already giving it away
__label__neg	Every time we've tried to empty it, we ended up getting out a pair of scissors.
__label__pos	"""Couldn't be simpler."""
__label__neg	Some evenings the static is so bad, we just have to turn it off, and perk our ears, the good old-fashioned way. 
__label__neg	We had a problem with the moving frogs.
__label__neu	There was also a velcro tape that we could use to stick the mirror onto the seatback. 
__label__pos	Diaper Champ wins by 1 reason alone - they DO NOT REQUIRE you to buy their bags.
__label__pos	I purchased these for my daughter to use in the baby's room because they matched the bedding set and other items she'd chosen.
__label__neu	Oh the little red pegs at the base should always be putdown if your baby is on the floor common sense.
__label__pos	Today, she is 10 weeks old and I finally had the sense to install batteries in it!
__label__neg	 Unfortunately, it only worked twice
__label__neu	I bought this for my son when he was 2 and a half before we took a trip that would have us visiting a couple of hotels in a couple of different cities with my in-laws.
__label__neu	For the first month or two while we bathed her in a baby bathtub it worked great. 
__label__neu	"""The one thing that would make this mat better is a stiffer rubber because the design is so adorable."""
__label__neg	 Her son didn't like it
__label__neu	I got this pump while my baby was on a nursing strike,  and it helped me when I was engorged but even then it wasn't a whiz and now that I'm back to normal,  it hardly works at all.
__label__neg	 I really give it zero stars
__label__pos	It seems good quality and the seems are well made.The photos do not do justice to the cuteness of this toy!
__label__pos	Lightweight & versatile!
__label__pos	My baby did not fuss at all when I offered her these type of nipples (compared to the breast).  
__label__pos	Cute, durable and used teething toy.
__label__neg	Like digital television, this is a digital technology that leaves a lot to be desired
__label__pos	Definitely worth every penny.
__label__pos	"""That's it though."""
__label__neu	The rim around the bottom of the plate has the equivalent of a rubber band to keep it from skidding. 
__label__pos	This is really good for women who are used to sleeping on their back normally but have to start sleeping on their sides as they progress into their pregnancy(like myself).This pillow helps a great deal.
__label__neu	Oh well
__label__neu	Try the colored ones.
__label__neu	I originally bought the Munchkin formula dispenser to use while we were out and about.
__label__pos	It is a great looking backpack and works if you only need to go somewhere for a short period of time
__label__pos	I really like the raised sides, it keeps his playthings and cheerios from sliding off of the tray.  
__label__pos	I received the Snugli as a shower gift and it is a wonderful product.  
__label__neu	I suggest the Playtex ventair system for a regular bottle because it has the same basic nipple shape. 
__label__neu	"""I have been using the Genie for the first four months of my daughter's life."""
__label__neu	A lot
__label__pos	It is high enough for a young toddler to reach the toilet (though it could be just a bit higher for really young ones like 18mo) and the rails make toddlers feel *so* secure.
__label__neu	Okay,  so I chintzed out and bought the cheaper doorway jumper
__label__neg	 They absorb very little as they are 100% cotton
__label__neg	I am really frustrated that this cup leaks with even normal (not toddler like) use.
__label__pos	"""now #2 is here and loves it just as much!"""
__label__neu	I'm a father of two one is currently swaddled in this.
__label__pos	I am pleased that I can avoid cold wipes especially in the middle of the night or after a particuarly bad BM.
__label__neu	However, we switched to Dr. Brown's when our son began suffering from gas and nipple confusion, since I am nursing.
__label__neu	I switched to AVENT and my baby is like a different baby.
__label__pos	He laughs and smiles at himself
__label__neg	It's upsetting that my Babies r Us only carries this brand. 
__label__pos	These bottles are not that hard to clean and worth the extra little effort it does take since it obviously helps with gas.
__label__neg	I'm also really sick and tired of having to buy the refills
__label__neu	When my son was born last December this car seat was hard to find then so we borrowed one from my sister-in-law.  
__label__pos	"""My DS used it for the first three months of his life A LOT!"""
__label__neu	We moved and I no longer had access to buy the same mattress for my second child. 
__label__pos	This is a wonderful product
__label__pos	"""It's been a great toy for him to play with independently."""
__label__neu	 already, I would think
__label__pos	Worked perfect!
__label__neg	These nipples were supposedly better than the regular nipples that came with the Evenflo glass bottles, but I personally did not like them (saw NO difference in function between this and regular nipples). 
__label__neu	It does work and is a good size, but it is so cold, utilitarian, and almost ugly in it's bare functionality.
__label__neg	 It doesn't leak from the mouth piece - it leaked from the bottom!
__label__pos	It is heavier than the first mattress I bought, but still MUCH lighter than a traditional mattress. 
__label__pos	I just love it.
__label__neg	The static is UNREAL! 
__label__neg	"""I found the nipple to be way too hard for my newborn son to suck."""
__label__pos	Very helpful to have extras!
__label__neu	"""I used mine up to when my son was 10 months."""
__label__pos	I thought that the loud bubble motor sounds would bother her, but it has been just the opposite.
__label__pos	I purchased this rocker to get more use from it, and I am very pleased.
__label__neu	I can turn it to the voice dial only and block out any other background noise.
__label__neg	She would roll and turn while sleeping and apparently her limbs would lift over the bumper and the bumper would crumble under the light pressure of a babies arm. 
__label__neg	It is kind of hard to hold becasue it is so wide though
__label__pos	I like the fish and the music.
__label__neg	Overall,  this is a cheap set and I wouldn't recommend it
__label__neu	They came out with a new bottle and nipple
__label__pos	This is, however, a good and sometimes great stroller for toddlers and lighter weight preschoolers. 
__label__neg	Don't waste your time or money.
__label__neu	I do agree with one of the reviewers you get some of the items in the hospital, however, we didn't get all of the items and when you're a new parent pressed for time, it's awfully convenient to have everything you need packed into one kit.
__label__neg	currently searching for a new cup to transition from bottle.
__label__pos	We made it huge by not closing the ends together but make a semi circle wall against a wall outlet free wall and she had the best time in her area I never had to worry about her safety as I went about my daily chores, she even took naps in it.
__label__neg	It may fit some babies,  but definatley not mine
__label__pos	"""She can yank on it all she wants, it isn't going anywhere."""
__label__neu	I've accidentally put mine in the dryer a few times with out shrinkage.
__label__pos	The sleep sheep arrived in what appeared to be great condition and was really cute
__label__neg	For the price, not a lot of features like cup holder.
__label__pos	It's brought lots of smiles and glee for babyand a breather for the parents.
__label__neu	They are more work to clean ,but if you buy enough they can be put in the dishwasher so it really isn't a big deal.  
__label__neu	 Therefore I had to switch very quickly to playtex standard bottles. 
__label__neu	It always has static and background noise (including our neigbors!but I'm told a lot of monitors do that),  so the red light is always on.
__label__pos	If we're busy around the house or want to go for a walk it allows our baby to be close to us (and when he's upset this helps a ton).
__label__pos	It is a decent size.
__label__pos	"""Again, we really liked it when our babies were small - if that's what you are looking for, this is the way to go..."""
__label__pos	So these mats would only work on bucket seats that are on the smaller side
__label__neu	I went the next day, Monday and bought one of these Snack Trap cups. 
__label__neg	"""so really I'm not sure why I'd need it."""
__label__pos	The tray is just the right height.
__label__neg	 BUt I wouldn't spend $20 on a mirror for that purpose
__label__pos	It made my 20 pound 4 month old feel nearly 10 pounds lighter as soon as I strapped him in.  
__label__neu	We took off the music and motor and reattached with just some string.
__label__pos	The safest option!
__label__neg	I read lots of reviews on all the monitors and thought this one would be the best for our money but this one is going back to the store ASAP
__label__neu	Outside of Amazon my favorite brand by far is Thirsties.
__label__neu	Will let the review know when and if he uses and likes it.
__label__pos	I haven't had to worry about safety with them either as they collapse easily.
__label__neg	 If it were only a little longer, I would give it 5 stars
__label__neu	"""I was on the fence about buying this toy due to its price, but one day I went shopping at the farmer's market and EVERY baby had one."""
__label__pos	You can purchase this item without any fear of buyer's remorse.
__label__pos	This thing is great.
__label__neu	"She wanted to pick out a new set of bedding for her ""big toddler bed."
__label__pos	Perfect for kids.
__label__pos	Buy the Bjorn Carrier Cover too,  I really think it's worth the value if you're going outside in the wind/rain elements!!
__label__pos	"""I was amazed at how much milk I got at the first sitting!"""
__label__neu	"""But to backtrack to the birth of my son."""
__label__neg	The only issue we see with it is cleaning, it's a very unique shape and you've gotta wiggle that bottle brush in there to get the bottom middle part.
__label__neg	 The cylinder continually got stuck, and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder
__label__pos	The video quality is great.  
__label__neg	 It was terrible for my back. 
__label__neu	 We did & it worked
__label__neu	"""(I did not put it in the dryer, though!)"""
__label__pos	"""I own the pump in style advanced..."""
__label__neu	"""The only thing that would make this bouncer better would be for it to rock on it's own when the baby moves."""
__label__neg	My daughter is a big newborn (10.8lbs) so her size may have something to do with the lack of safety of the sline but she is not mature enough to sit up in the tub yet.
__label__neg	 Plus, he wasn't yet sitting up on his own, but laying back would make the tub tip backwards
__label__neg	smaller nipple,  but more bubbles and gas for baby
__label__neu	Don't waste your money!
__label__pos	The two different sides (reclining/sitting) really extend the life of this tub and it is an excellent value.
__label__neu	Cost more but they know what they are making.
__label__pos	 The razor to cut the bags is fine
__label__neg	I was trying to save money when I bought this one thinking I'd found an affordable alternative but I only got what I paid for
__label__pos	I purchased this mobile for my little one thinking it would be a slam dunk
__label__neg	 Then you don't have to come home and remember to boil this stupid thing
__label__pos	We have three dogs, and I need my hands free to walk the dogs, but I like for the baby to come along, too.
__label__neg	I followed all the directions to avoid other interferrances but none helped
__label__neg	Also,  I was thinking I would place one on my middle seat so my kids in the very back seat (third row) wouldn't mess up the back of the middle seat
__label__neu	Gary Peterson
__label__neu	We have a Britax Boulevard and the sides slope too steeply is the reason why it rests on his knees.
__label__neu	Note - I maybe filled it a 1/4 of the way
__label__pos	"""3. There is 3 vibration modes, unlike the 1 with the K n P."""
__label__pos	"""We then had our lap free for a moment to read or relax."""
__label__pos	I'll be buying more of these sheets for my daughter's crib,  because I am so impressed
__label__pos	it gets great useage,  and gives baby visibility to their surroundings
__label__neu	Admittedly not all children make valiant attempts at getting out of their blankets,  however my little girl was pretty intent.
__label__neg	My 1 month old gets frusterated that nothing is coming out.
__label__pos	I was able to lay him down on the soft surface and clean him all over without any tears!
__label__neu	Besides,  once a child starts consuming lots of solids,  the diaper contents pretty much fall right off without any hassle.
__label__pos	While it is a nice product while it lasts,  I just expected them to be more durable
__label__neu	With the voice activation feature you hear nothing,  I repeat nothing,  unless the sound registers over a certain decibel
__label__pos	and the elephant is just too funny, twisting like crazy because of his extra weight).
__label__pos	Child safety lock.
__label__neu	I have had so many less frustrations with the Britax and it even has little velcro spots to put the straps on when you are not using them so that when you put your child in you are not mussing about trying to find the straps from underneath them.
__label__pos	The sterilizer Avent is so good that i do not hesitate to buy a new one, I attribute the failure to trip was the product of USA to Venezuela
__label__neu	He was 9 lbs at birth
__label__neg	However it was picking up a lot of interference in a semi deserted mountain retreat in NJ.  
__label__pos	This mirror works great in the back of our compact car and in the back of our large truck.
__label__neg	This seat has never sat right on any toilet I have encountered and actually made my son frightened to use it
__label__pos	The entire line works together from breast pumps, to sanitizers, to storage containers, to sippy cups.
__label__neu	I purchased this so we could have our daughter's handprint for her very first Christmas.
__label__neg	0s,  but are probably backstock from before they started putting in the infant sized insert.
__label__neu	otherwise this ring - which can not be adjusted to fit - will slide around a lot and feel very unstable when you're trying to toilet train
__label__pos	Our son loves his bed
__label__neu	I checked the online reviews of this product before spending the money on it
__label__neu	the result was that my kitchen counter and floor were a mess.
__label__neu	I got this as a shower gift.
__label__pos	"""These are absolutely necessary to get your co-sleeper to be level with the bed if you have a thick mattress (which most of them are these days)."""
__label__pos	Really a nice product, helped me feel more comfortable about bathing a newborn!
__label__pos	"""While this is fine for silicone nipples, BF's specialized vent has the aforementioned ""mini-nipple"" which is very delicate."""
__label__neu	and i just enjoy pumping now.
__label__pos	The whole idea of a baby tub with a shower is an excellent idea...
__label__neu	"""Needless to say, weaning her to my breast was not easy and very, very frustrating."""
__label__neu	The seal did come out but it does not affect the odor.
__label__neu	Very disappointed!
__label__pos	Plus it has a great tummy time set up and way more durable.
__label__neu	This fit perfectly on the crib mattress out of the bag but when I washed it it shrunk a good inch or two.
__label__neu	I didn't care for this at all.
__label__neg	It says it fits most standard rails but doesn't give any measurements.
__label__neu	They also did not keep my daughter from being gassy.
__label__pos	The Freestyle works just as well. 
__label__neu	We lowered the toys with the extra  lincs so they would be within him reach. 
__label__neg	 It smells SO much worse
__label__neg	The big problem was with it falling off
__label__neu	adds extra padding,  protects the seat and is easy to wash
__label__neu	Maybe that's my fault, I don't know.
__label__neu	 Gas my baby had been experiencing also seemed to decrease after switching as he is not sucking as hard
__label__pos	Update at 7 mos (July04): Using more now that he is bigger &amp; harder to take to the tub with me (wants to crawl in the water).  
__label__pos	This is a nice seat -- so comfy my 18-mo-old can use and stable enough that the 3yo also loves it
__label__neg	You can pop the top right off like a tupperware lid.
__label__neg	First of all, and the greatest problem, my son freaked out when I put him inside of this.
__label__neu	"""I also run a Home Daycare."""
__label__neu	Second,  it gets heavy once it's wet and flattens.
__label__pos	Have used it for about 1.5 years and VERY happy that we bought it.  
__label__neg	 Upon comparison this pacifier has a much shorter sucking part-- the clear part that goes in their mouth. 
__label__neu	Our son was born a day before a major snow storm in NJ, and we had this ready to go in the car seat the day we left the hospital. 
__label__neu	I am guessing that since the boys urine comes out the front,  rather than underneath,  it leaks out in that space where the bowl slides out
__label__neu	We just resoak the pad once a week to keep from having brown wipes and we haven't had one at all.
__label__neu	Why do people devise ways to frustrate pregnant women?
__label__neu	If you baby is at all active, she will just kick the hard bottom of the seat where the on/off switch is. 
__label__neg	Even in its most inclined position, it isn't comfortable, legs are at a 90 degrees angle which is horrible for a newborn, and the baby's head is never well supported.Better buy a Maxi Cosi or an other infant seat !
__label__pos	This is definitely worth the money.
__label__pos	I highly recommend this item to all mothers, especially if you plan on breasfeeding!
__label__pos	With the active carrier,  I can do everything & go anywhere and it does not hurt my back or shoulders.
__label__neg	 I'm sorry I ever bought them
__label__neu	Updated
__label__pos	This bib is nice because it's 100% plastic and surface washable.
__label__pos	My baby Amelia has been in it since week 1 and she is 3 months and still loves it.
__label__neg	This product doesn't get the job done.
__label__neu	So, after no success, I came on to Amazon and found the many incredible reviews of this product using them as burp cloths.
__label__pos	It is comfortable, cozy, warm, and easier to use than a snowsuit/coat.
__label__neu	 THe catch -- do not use dish soap to fill OR regular bubble mix...so you've gotta use their special mixture to refill bubbles. 
__label__neu	"""He would cry, and wouldn't go to the potty."""
__label__pos	After being dried, they took on a bubbly, muslin-like appearance, where the premiums were crisp, solid and flat.
__label__neu	well upon further inspection there was a slit in the spout and the bars inside of the spout were all broken!
__label__neu	This hands-free gate works when you step down on the foot paddle which causes a latch to open
__label__neg	Would be even better if it had wheels.
__label__pos	It has many options to keep babies entertained when you need to get house work done, dinner cooked or just go to the bathroom.My husband is currently deployed so I spend a lot of time traveling in between my family's houses.
__label__neu	"""6 months, that there's an urgent need to have something in place, helping the child's head in developing to a correct shape."""
__label__pos	I put the Moby in storage and currently using (and very satisfied with) a Baby Bjorn carrier.
__label__neg	My car has a leather interior, and the last thing I wanted to do was poke holes in the leather! 
__label__pos	"""Other features that we like are the side-to-side or front-to-back swinging option, the wonderful mobile which features up-and-down movement, and the music/rainfall noises."""
__label__neg	We decided to buy the Philips SCD590 DECT based monitor that costs twice as much to replace this.
__label__pos	"""I'm very pleased!"""
__label__neg	Cons:  A little too big, (he can break free EASILY), I've found my son with it over his mouth and nose numerous times, not good!! 
__label__neu	"""this will give it the strongest grip."""
__label__neu	I did have some problems with the odor but I think anything you put poop in and let sit for days will have odor so that's inevitable!
__label__pos	 It was fine at first
__label__neu	Buy a straight but fairly flexible body pillow.
__label__neg	 it's not sturdy enough to support a toddler
__label__neg	It does not seem very sturdy at all and I would be worried putting her on it.
__label__pos	Easily removable to take into the car. 
__label__neg	This monitor is not worth the money
__label__pos	It's very discreet and it has a very good size (not too big, not too small).
__label__neu	I attached this to my grandchild's rainforest bouncer when the batteries ran out.  
__label__pos	"""Certainly not worth $40. It's cute because it matches my baby's stars/moonbeams nursery theme but it's not the best quality."""
__label__neu	The final straw came 6 months after using it
__label__neu	"""Oh please!"""
__label__neu	"""So I looked into other carriers and the one that recieved 5+ star reviews (and was about $150) was the Ergo Baby Carrier; my sister had had one when my two nephews were little and it was great!"""
__label__pos	They are also good for just holding a plain old ice cube when baby is teething.
__label__neu	We bought a Diaper Genie II to supplement our Diaper GEnie II Elite
__label__neu	Pockets for the bottle and a water bottle on the sides are the only perks I can put on here, but most diaper bags have that, sooooo...
__label__neu	 They are only a little over half as deep as the drawer fronts are tall
__label__neu	The problem lies in how the top u-shaped portion is sewn--it is sewn so tightly and stiffly that it digs into your neck.
__label__neg	"""I thought I had a large or standard tub spout/faucet, but this is too big for it."""
__label__neg	 Then just today, April 25, 07 the motor conked out AGAIN
__label__neu	Glass Nurser - 6-Pack
__label__neg	And this pump can be squeeky.
__label__neu	Ok I have not used the new & improved version but I can tell you.
__label__pos	Yummy snuggly.
__label__pos	My girl is 2.5 months old and large (15 pounds) but she fits in this thing perfectly just now.
__label__neg	The locks simply do not catch. 
__label__pos	"""It seems very sturdy and would probably hold a lot more weight if we had heavier toys."""
__label__pos	I wish i would have brought this to the hospital with me when i was struggling to the point of tears with nursing.
__label__neu	Finally my husband put silicone all around it which helped. 
__label__neg	 Plus the bottles are expensive
__label__neu	I thought the bags would be convenient and make clean up easy,  plus the bottles are supposed to be like the breast right?
__label__pos	THIS IS NOT A LOUD, ANNOYING TOY.THIS IS A PERFECT SIZE AND WAIT AND DESIGN TOY FOR BABIES AROUND NINE MONTHS AND UP.
__label__neu	I have contacted The First Years about this problem but so far have not rec'vd a reply.
__label__pos	Plus having the baby within my arm's reach to soothe also added more hours to my sleep, which I desperately needed since I was the only one at home to take care of the baby (hubby had to go back to work after the first week).Adding the extensions does make the bed more shaky, but it's not going to collapse or tip over, especially when the cosleeper is right next to the adult bed.
__label__neu	Their issue may have been that they didn't read the directions regarding the valve.
__label__neu	Also,  it has a pocket on the inside of the seat that can be used for storage of a small bottle or toy
__label__pos	I also used it when I bottle fed the little tike and it worked rather well. 
__label__neu	Browns.
__label__neg	 We assembled this one fine and it works ok, but I am worried it is going to fall apart every time we use it
__label__pos	i have not had any technical problems with it so far, 3 weeks of use, so i keep my fingers crossed.over all it's a very nice mobile, and having two kids, i've been through quite a few, still haven't found the perfect one, but this is the closest i've found to perfect.
__label__neu	There is a little band you can slip a sippy cup in
__label__pos	We love this sterilizer.
__label__neu	Plus the handle and the ring thingie don't fit into our bottle washing dishwasher basket.
__label__neg	 Now all we hear is static that only gives way to clicks and leaves us wondering which is more annoying
__label__neu	"""Want to get some house work done, but the baby wants you to be held?"""
__label__neg	The only thing I was not too thrilled about was the mattress it comes with.
__label__neg	 I have decided to put this one away and maybe for the next one we can use it
__label__pos	The wattage is simple to use, just look inside your microwave on the bottom with all the info and it tells you what wattage it is and them refer to the manual to see the time. 
__label__neu	One infant's junk is another infant's treasure.  
__label__neu	However, once she starts solids, I'm going to get the diaper genie back out and use it again.
__label__pos	I have even used it in our sink and it supports her perfectly!
__label__neg	 They are thin, and not soft at all
__label__neu	But,  if you're the type of person who does everything by the book,  the air drying can be inconvenient if you don't have another clean sheet on hand.
__label__pos	If she tends to get fussy in her carseat,  we simply turn the music on and she usually stops fussing and eventually falls asleep
__label__pos	Our daughter was able to go back and forth between breat and bottle at each feeding very easily.
__label__neu	This one arrived dented,  and the seller (set 4 baby) and Amazon refused to do anything about it.
__label__pos	That is what I ended up  buying and it is WONDERFUL.
__label__pos	We're thrilled--and wish we had it from the very first week!
__label__pos	"""you won't regret it either if you baby has some trouble sleeping."""
__label__neg	I also like the Decor because you can dispose of the diaper with your foot, instead of a hand like with the Champ, because now that my son is super squirmy on the changing table, I need of my hands on him!
__label__neu	When my baby started chewing on the teether toys that are part of this jumper (the yellow sun and the bead chaser) I wrote to the company to make sure these toys don't contain BPA and other harmful chemicals.
__label__neg	"I agree with the previous review from ""Meesah"""
__label__pos	"""We love this gate, it is so easy to install."""
__label__neg	We were wrong--it wasn't useful.
__label__neg	 If you're going to spend money, then spend it on a more accurate pump
__label__neu	I love that it's BPA free and it's easy to drink from, but it just leaks too much.
__label__neg	Overall,  the product works but if you choose to purchase this item please remove it from your baby gear/stroller/car seat when you remove the bottle or sippy.
__label__neg	We thought about keeping this one
__label__pos	great for preemies
__label__neu	This monitor has zero interference.
__label__pos	We have this monitor and I could not live without it.
__label__neg	My son was squirmy enough from the beginning that he managed to slither out of this after a week or two. 
__label__pos	I also don't have to worry about it slipping off my shoulders.
__label__neu	Infantino Peek, Rattle and Teether
__label__pos	These bottles were great with my daughter switching back in forth from breast to bottle.
__label__neg	These bottles leak
__label__neu	He can pick them up, transfer them from hand to hand.
__label__neg	Great bottles when used with nipples,  terrible design with the sippy cup attachment.
__label__neg	As much as we love the Ergo Baby, this insert thing just confused us.
__label__pos	He's still getting use to taking a bath and he cried much louder in a normal tub.
__label__pos	I love the Bundle Me.
__label__neu	I wash them in warm water and dry them on low or medium heat in the dryer.
__label__neu	We brough it for my older son when he was 5 mounths old.
__label__neg	the replacement bags cost too much and don't justify the convenience
__label__neg	 The bottom line is the basic 99 cent bottle at your local supermarket will do the job
__label__pos	I would have purchased this chair first if I had seen it.
__label__neu	First,  the side wasn't long enough to fit between my legs for support.
__label__neg	not because it's a bad product but rather why waste the money when a bath sponge will do
__label__neg	Unfortunately, the plastic is weak and overly flexible, whereas it should be strong  to resist bending it off.
__label__neg	You need a really long neck to be comfortable using it
__label__pos	I was very pleased at the comfort in the seat padding and the fact the seatbelts rarely twist.
__label__neu	The only good thing about this is the night light function. 
__label__pos	There is so much fun going on, it's like our baby has her own personal Disney ride at home!
__label__pos	but I like the hippo.. 
__label__pos	The shape of this pillow did not fit my body correctly(because of the pre-shaped curves) If you put the head curve under your head your arm will fall asleep & I normally sleep with my arm under my head,  so I don't get it.
__label__pos	"""I've tried a few different kinds of sippy cups, and this is the only kind my 9 month old son will drink from."""
__label__neu	It easily attaches to a stroller (I have a bugaboo) and the bag itself can hook and unhook with the 2 clasps easily leaving the hooks on the stroller itself.
__label__pos	This, combined with a 3pk of 4oz bottles makes a a great start to infant feeding.
__label__neu	 It was very easy to install, but the red strap that fits around the seat was directly behind his head, making him keep his head forward. 
__label__neu	Moms are always looking for something that will keep snacks from getting thrown everywhere.
__label__pos	and very durable
__label__pos	The 3- point to 5- point harness is helpful for keeping the baby in place.
__label__neu	Amazon had the best price as well
__label__neg	 The new design is jsut as poor as the original
__label__pos	Now she's a pro!
__label__neg	Buyer BEWARE
__label__pos	After 2 years & 2 babies: I love it!
__label__pos	We have the Precious Planet Jumperoo for our 5 month old daughter downstairs and she is seriously addicted to it.
__label__neg	 its really awkward
__label__pos	 I do know that his Avent pacifier does not do this. 
__label__pos	"""This is the best potty seat I purchased."""
__label__neg	 This pillow is so bad
__label__neg	The bobby was way too cumbersome for nursing. 
__label__pos	ago, I have LOVED FP toys!
__label__neg	For those largely pregnant, just find yourself the tiniest halter top, crop top, or babydoll tee you can and put it on (if you can), then take a long sash and cinch it up under your belly... that's what you're going to look like in this thing.
__label__neg	Aside from this, our baby usually cries loud enough to hear her without the monitor. 
__label__pos	Gotta Get 2!
__label__pos	But I most tell you avent work very well with gasy babies, so if you dont want to invest too much  money in bottles, avent will do great.
__label__pos	Battery lasts forever when off charger.
__label__pos	The sleep sack is the perfect way for our son to stay warm at night and I am so glad I have it.
__label__pos	"""The reason I ordered this instead of another similar toy is because of the rings that hang from the bottom."""
__label__pos	"""The water level is great."""
__label__pos	No loops, no straps to re-thread.
__label__pos	This solved my problems.
__label__neu	In addition,  the covers do not fit the changing pad very well and pull up at the sides.
__label__pos	I would say this was well worth the price considering the size of the pad, and it has a cute print on it.  
__label__pos	"""The ring sling digs into my neck whereas the sleepy wrap stays evenly on both shoulders."""
__label__neu	Better to borrow one from a friend.
__label__pos	The bottles are not at all hard to wash or assemble.  
__label__neg	Not a great pail, it doesn't cost cheap, but it's made cheap.
__label__neg	I did remember that the manual grinders did leak a bit from the bottom but I just placed it in a flat bottomed Tupperware container to catch the juice.
__label__neu	My 12 week old daughter is all over the place when it's time to sleep and has been since day 1.  
__label__neg	don't believe the hoopla
__label__neu	I tried the NUK type and they kept flying out of my baby's mouth.
__label__neu	I have elderly in-laws and several different babysitters who were ALL going to need to use these to go up and down the stairs several times a visit
__label__neg	Plus her room really smelled bad.
__label__neu	Easy clean.
__label__neu	He could hear me everywhere he went, both upstairs and down.
__label__pos	This product folds up well for travel,  which is one of the main reasons we registered for it
__label__neu	This is especially true if you have an elongated toilet bowl.  
__label__neu	I put in some apple pieces and had to stand up at the table and push down with all my might while turning the handle to get the mill to work.
__label__pos	Very comfortable for breast or bottle feeding and as a pillow for and adult!
__label__neg	My son didn't like this very much.
__label__pos	Edited two years later: We've discovered a much better use for these plates! 
__label__neu	We had the older model that was also round looking with two fish. 
__label__neg	if I hadn't returned this car seat when she was 8 weeks old,weighed 11
__label__neg	 They are impossible for her to squeeze and they are hard for me to get them to connect and stay put
__label__neu	blankets like the Kiddopotamus & Co. Organic Cotton SwaddleMe - Ivory.
__label__pos	My baby sleeps very well in it naps and nighttime.
__label__neu	The latch is not easy to open you have to use two hands which defeats the purpose of the latch being one hand slide.
__label__pos	"""The fact that it uses regular garbage bags is a huge advantage and we have never had any problems with the smell. . ."""
__label__neg	I don't even know what to say
__label__pos	We've never had a problem, and any time I've experienced a leak, I've been able to troubleshoot the problem by taking the lid off and usually, it was an issue of the valve not being snapped in all the way.  
__label__neu	but I think they need to redesign the shower handle.  
__label__neg	 Save your money for a better product
__label__neu	As it is now, you have to switch the button back and forth between the two rooms to monitor children sleeping at the same time.
__label__neu	too bad they didn't tell me before I registered for them
__label__pos	"""First baby view mirror I have bought, but after reading the reviews I decided to buy."""
__label__neg	If you put it in upright without the cap,  the bottom opens up and spills into the warmer
__label__neu	I purchased this tub after reading all the online reviews of all the other tubs.  
__label__neu	It takes some adjusting and it does tend to move around.
__label__pos	Another plus is is compact foldability.
__label__neu	"""I was given this toy at my baby shower by a relative with young children."""
__label__pos	The diaper wipes dispenser was broken so I called the company, they shipped a new one out immediately!When my daughter gets older and less demanding (diaper bag wise) I intend on buying the Daisy Gear tote.This bag really has everything you'll need.
__label__pos	D  I'd recommend this to anyone!
__label__neu	I bought this for our garden tub and it just barely fits.  
__label__pos	This monitor worked great for the first week
__label__pos	"""It has many parts that are easy for little hands to grip (all the legs and the neck), and good places of harder rubber to chew (the ears and whatever those little vestigial horns are between the ears), and it even squeaks like old-school dog toys."""
__label__neg	However she loves to stretch and move around a lot so she tends to squirm and get uncomfortable in the tie that I have her in when she's awake.
__label__neg	When we used those little floating rubber ducks that have the word HOT on the bottom that turn white when the water is too hot, the plug didn't turn white.
__label__pos	The splash guard is great for boys.
__label__neg	I gave only 4 stars because it does hold dog hair and lint on the black parts pretty badly.
__label__neg	On the other hand,  snapping all the ties on the ultimate crib sheet takes bending over the crib for five solid minutes (plus,  the manufacturer recommends snapping the snaps before every wash,  which means snap on crib,  unsnap,  snap again before wash,  unsnap,  snap on crib
__label__neu	The cubby consists of a cute underwater background of bubbles with multicolored fish, whale, and alligator and strong plastic suction cups on the outside.  
__label__pos	 I'm going back to this brush!(Old review below)Purchased this brush to use on my Dr. 
__label__neg	"""The lowest setting was almost catapulting my newborn out of it."""
__label__neg	The seat itself is a bit slippery so we had to put something on it first so he wouldn't slide (washcloth will do).
__label__neu	For the first year there really wasn't any oder at all.  
__label__neg	These bottles are the worst I've ever seen
__label__pos	70% of the time, the tub doesn't leak
__label__neu	She likes the different animals and enjoys talking to the baby in the mirror.
__label__neu	We have a full sized cradle swing we keep in the living room for during the day, but I wouldn't want to live without this as our nighttime and traveling swing.
__label__pos	We had a little bit of trouble putting it together but in the end I feel like it is very sturdy and I am very pleased with the way it looks.
__label__pos	This tub has gave me so much confidence that after the first bath, I didn't need to ask my husband to stand around, because all the nervousness was gone... the person who created this design had new mothers like me in mind... thank you, thank you, thank you...
__label__neg	We registered for this and believed that it would be an absolute necessity, but I wish we hadn't, at least right away.
__label__pos	My 4 yr old likes that it doesn't go in the ear.
__label__neu	I do give it one star because it is pretty
__label__neu	 They sit on their own and don't need to be set in a cup
__label__neu	Per Wired Magazine's May 2005 edition (Page 61): Shopping cart handle germ count: 1 MILLION.
__label__neu	The foam wasn't pre-punched with holes for the mounting screws - trying poke the screws through and insert resulted in foam twisting around screws, so it was necessary to use a hole punch to make holes in the foam.
__label__pos	It works great! 
__label__pos	"""The rocking motion, music, and sounds have all been a lifesaver when my arms were just too tired to hold baby."""
__label__neg	They said not to add any after-market things to car seats or seat belts.
__label__neu	Again my 15 month old has lost interest in even trying to mess with it.
__label__pos	Now with my son (13 months also averadge size) We have been using this seat for a few months: He has never fallen in to the water and he is more active than she was.
__label__neg	Some would choke and gag him some didn't even work and NOTHING would come out some were okay you get the point.
__label__neg	I wish it went higher up on the weight though since my son grew so rapidly.
__label__neg	We can't even hear the baby!
__label__neg	"Ok, when I first heard about it, I hated it and thought,"" why do I need to spend so much money for a stupid ""c"" pillow with cover?"
__label__pos	And the mobile is so adorable you'll both get a kick out of it.
__label__pos	It's also inexpensive
__label__neu	We just sold it in our garage sale - I think we probably used it about 3-4 times before we gave up because of the hassle.
__label__pos	"""I have both the kick and play and this and I found this to be MUCH better."""
__label__pos	I would definetly recomend this to any new parent!
__label__neu	The neck is high enough to cover his collar which used to get hit even with a bib.
__label__pos	Perfect accessory for strollers without a parent tray on the handles. 
__label__pos	These are the only sheets I have ever used in my son's crib
__label__pos	I wish I found it sooner!
__label__pos	Was still very stable and safe.
__label__pos	"""It is wonderful!"""
__label__neu	i was looking for a stylish bag that suits the purpose.
__label__neu	I like it, my daughter hates it....
__label__neg	Next time I suggest it being near the price of the product
__label__pos	Perfect!
__label__pos	I use a Medela breast pump and the Born-Free bottles, like the Avent bottles, do not fit on the pump.
__label__neg	Taking it off is even worse because it seems to lock down and get stuck
__label__neg	"I bought this teether hoping to avoid the ubiquitous ""made in China"" plasticware that most teethers are."
__label__neg	I wish I hadn't bought two of these at the same time-- I was so sure we'd like them
__label__neu	With so much of the baby out of the water, my baby got cold very quickly.
__label__pos	 I called Britax  (they have the best customer service), I explained my situation and they agreed to replace my seat free of charge with either a Marathon or Boulvard. 
__label__neu	For the price,  you would think that it would seal each diaper individually.
__label__neu	At first we debated over spending this much but now we are so glad we did.
__label__pos	 When I brought my 8 pound newborn home, I wrapped her in it right away
__label__pos	The material is nice and light, excellent quality, and the baby blue with navy stitching is a lovely color.
__label__pos	No expensive diaper genie bags to buy -- you can just use the plastic bags from the grocery store.
__label__pos	It supports her great.
__label__neu	My son hated it.
__label__neu	My 12 month old has no problems sitting in it.
__label__neu	It works great and is MUCH LESS COMPLICATED.
__label__pos	"""I'm interested to see how it's waterproof because it's not lined with anything waterproof, but then I like that as an organic product."""
__label__neu	It is removable but we had to break out tools to get the metal part out of the grooves.
__label__pos	"""It looks very sturdy and will be ""her chair"" at Grandma's house for a while."""
__label__neg	 Your child will most probably be putting these in their mouth
__label__neg	"""This was the biggest disappointment."""
__label__neg	We never used them.
__label__neg	BOTH lids have broken,  and that is with light use
__label__neu	Beside toddler need music, it is good to introduce them in early age and this only works when they move it.
__label__pos	It is gorgeous and is perfect for a little boy's room if you don't want everything to be baby blue!
__label__neg	) I would not recommend buying this somehow very popular product because there is no telling how long you will be able to use it and it is very hard on the lower back
__label__neu	I will just stick with multi-pillow props.
__label__neg	I have also noticed that the colors on the mat have faded a bit in the wash even though we use a mild detergent and have a front- loading machine.
__label__neg	It is not a good product if every single customer has to go through all the trouble of ordering non-toxic finish and sanding and finishing it themselves
__label__pos	This pump is also great for relieving engorgement.
__label__pos	"A fitted sheet for the cosleeper's ""mattress"" is included, and it is quite soft material compared to other sheets on the market.If you are tight on space in your bedroom, I recommend the mini version."
__label__neg	So I have to replace the battery every day to use it through the whole night and that gets pretty expensive.
__label__neg	I can't see over it and doesn't squeeze into the backseat very well.
__label__pos	"""Overall, Its one of those things that I cant live without but didnt know it until I got it."""
__label__neg	i registered and received this item,  but returned it because i wanted to possibly use the baby snuggle nest,  but ultimately had baby sleep in car seat for a while near me,  and then when in crib she was swaddled and couldnt roll over,  and as for the incline i purchased the crib wedge that is the width of the crib unlike the smallness of this one,  which is great when your baby can finally move around in the crib.
__label__pos	Love It! 
__label__neg	Not useful at all!
__label__neg	 There is a hole at the base of the nozzle, right where it meets the colored plastic
__label__pos	I much prefer the My Breast Friend pillow: it has a back support and is adjustable. 
__label__pos	The picture doesn't do it justice
__label__neg	Good concept,  but very messy
__label__neu	My baby loves to bathe and lays very calmly in the bath
__label__neu	I worked in the church nursery for over 4 years with this toy in one of the toyboxes available to the children
__label__neu	Also,  it's a total pain to clean it.
__label__neu	The suspender clip is hard to open!
__label__pos	"Liked that this changing pad had a ""well"" so our baby could less-easily roll herself off, although we always keep a hand on her, even when she was supertiny. "
__label__pos	This is a great carrier!
__label__neg	We don't really need to attach it to anything, and the plastic hook is HARD!  
__label__pos	But the tub itself works well.
__label__neu	They are there to get air to nipple, (you don't want them getting dried out, that just makes the pain of feeding much worse).
__label__neu	Still not sure? 
__label__neg	The ink is black,  smears easily,  and is hard to wipe off the baby's feet
__label__pos	"""He chews on it, throws it, and sleeps with it; the photos are very well protected."""
__label__neg	I will definitely purchase the next size.I have read the other review that mentioned the swaddler wrap getting bunched up around the neck and face.
__label__neu	Unless you put all 5 pieces of this cup together just right,  it leaks.
__label__neu	I have tried to get into the backs of a Mclaren stroller before it was much harder.  
__label__pos	This is a great diaper pail.
__label__pos	This mobile has great colors, is very interesting and totally captivates the attention of my 10 week old.  
__label__neu	Yes, I literally tossed it to the dogs!  
__label__neg	 I went with a New Native pouch and I LOVE it
__label__pos	It works quickly and it's so easy to use.
__label__pos	I got the Sage color and it really looks much better in person (fortunately).
__label__neu	It is a BIG WASTE OF MONEY.
__label__neu	My husband put it together in about an hour, and didn't have any problems (I warned him beforehand that the instructions were a little lacking). 
__label__pos	Great Potty Chair
__label__neg	My good-natured son cries and cries in what seems to be discomfort.
__label__neg	It ended up that both of us would have to be present to get him in the seat.
__label__pos	He can reach his food better in this little chair than he can in the fancy high chair that grandma has at her house.
__label__neg	but it's still annoyiong
__label__neu	"After swearing by Avent with my first, I never imagined the solution to feeding my second would be an ""old-fashioned"" type bottle."
__label__pos	It is really a great idea this speepSack. 
__label__pos	This is a great manual pump.  
__label__neu	It's one step closer to moving my son to using regular cups.
__label__pos	I am going today to buy two more for him to use at daycare.
__label__pos	He is so very funny in it.
__label__pos	This toy is wonderful.
__label__neu	The Cosco is adequate but the Britax is 1.
__label__pos	There are a few cute little 'touch' features on the mat, but it also includes a few toy loops across the edge.  
__label__neg	 What a waste of money
__label__neu	For the brief what, 3 minutes the lights started working. 
__label__neu	Let me say I have every band of frequency running through my home, Wireless N, G, B 5.8 GHZ phone, RF remotes, etc.
__label__pos	 Very cute face, though. 
__label__neu	Overall, the crib has met my expectations, so now I need to see how my baby boy takes to it when he gets here!
__label__pos	I like to keep the lights really dim at night so she can see the pretty lights.
__label__neg	 Please don't buy them, it is a huge waste of money
__label__pos	He loves all the toys on it, especially both the parrots. 
__label__pos	These can definitely be a life saver during the first 1-2 weeks when you don't want compression on the nipple and you want them to air dry
__label__neu	Bottom line
__label__neg	 :)
__label__neu	Overpriced leaky bottles!
__label__neg	"""1.  You are supposed to be able to twist the dial at the top to seal the diaper up."""
__label__neg	Scary!
__label__pos	I can't say enough good things about this item.
__label__neu	I have been able to get food stains out of the fabric by washing the entire cover on Delicate cycle and then air-drying. 
__label__neg	Also, (he was a June baby) the polyester type material made him very sweaty, which contributed further to multiple nightime awakenings. 
__label__pos	"""It's so easy for him to hold and play with."""
__label__neu	My baby at 2 weeks was pushing his way free
__label__pos	Also I posted some customer images for a better idea.
__label__neu	 My medela bags haven't split in the freezer... 
__label__neg	After breastfeeding for about four or more weeks,  I tried to get her to take a bottle and she refused the Medela nipple.
__label__pos	"""The mirror is cute, fits well, has a method of adjusting the angle, and I can see my child."""
__label__neu	for my queen size bed
__label__neg	If you put just a tad more milk the lid will leak and it's not easy trying to wash that skinny tube
__label__neu	I have owned my carrier for more than 6 years and it has been through 3 children. 
__label__neu	I tried a couple of these types of pillows first.
__label__pos	Pillows are much more effective in my opinion to prop up the baby while nursing. 
__label__pos	BUY BUY BUY
__label__neu	This item is recommended for children age 3 and up,  it falls apart and the stuffing falls out it can be a choking hazard!
__label__pos	"""I would recommend this product to anyone having a baby."""
__label__pos	I love it!  
__label__neu	 From the picture it just looks like this one is missing the diaper holder
__label__neu	I got this for my son a little early, around 3 months.  
__label__neg	I went through ALOT of bags (I use bottles now) and these were a pain
__label__pos	Perfect!
__label__pos	Medela is definitely the best pump to get, and don't even think about a manual one.
__label__neu	"""old son- we love this monitor so much that we bought it for both kids."""
__label__pos	 I bought this one because it had great reviews and was simple and easy to clean. 
__label__pos	The mesh bag does make it very easy to move the dirty laundry to the washer.
__label__pos	No spinning it or anyhting!
__label__neu	His leg was all scrunched up,  his head fell to one side (unpadded,  by the way),  and it was hard to fit it over my bathroom sink because it's a small round thing.
__label__neg	This toy does not make the crinkle noise.
__label__neu	We used avent, Playtex Ventaire adn Dr. Brown's with our daughter.
__label__neg	It's very difficult to adjust the seat positioning and my mom (who has this swing) has to turn the entire swing upside down to do it.
__label__neu	My 14 months old son only used this spoon a few times
__label__neu	My son has learned to unhook the tray and when he does he just about falls out.
__label__neg	Don't waste your money
__label__pos	great choice
__label__pos	"""We started with Avent and loved them until we found the Playtex Ventaire but Dr. Brown's beats them both hands down!"""
__label__neu	Gary Peterson
__label__neg	I'm just not sure if it's worth it
__label__neu	The only cons about Dr. Brown's bottles are that our son has a hard time feeding from any other bottle. 
__label__neu	They fall right out of your bra when you go to nurse your baby. 
__label__neg	Don't bother buying these if you want your baby to take in less air
__label__neu	He's also very active,  which may be the reason why.
__label__neu	I got this as a gift and I wish I had a gift receipt to return it...I takes up too much space in the freezer and only holds 12 bags.
__label__pos	its so awesome.
__label__pos	Great toy for little babies
__label__pos	I think its cute and I like that it plays music.
__label__neu	"""etc."""
__label__neg	"""It turns out that it takes too long for his to file her nails down."""
__label__neu	She likes pulling on objects but once they are in her grasp lets them go and looks for something else to grasp.
__label__pos	"""They are sturdy, my daughter has been using them to stand on for a while, long before she started potty training."""
__label__neg	When i moved to the bath ring it's plastic edges are sharp and usually scratched him while he moved around
__label__pos	I have trouble squeezing these to make the water squirt out - no way can my kids do them!
__label__pos	We have added pictures of smiling babies and cute animals to the picture holder and I change the picture everyday.
__label__pos	Hope it works out for you.
__label__pos	This is the first time a toy has made him laugh.  
__label__neu	I heard so many good things about these bottles,  and after no success with the also praised Avent system,  I switched to Dr
__label__pos	It's a great item for grandma to pick up for those special visits to her house - forget the high chair!My son has used his booster exclusively since he was able to sit up comfortably.  
__label__neg	It easily gets snagged on rings and jewelry so now I have to take my jewelry off before changing him
__label__neu	There must be something in our house or neighborhood that causes interference.
__label__pos	This stroller is perfect for anyone who has an infant and a toddler. 
__label__neg	It is not secure either.
__label__neg	First, the price is very high.
__label__neg	And why should a bottle be so complicated that you have to either hold it just right or screw the lid on just right,  not to tight you know
__label__pos	This is one snazzy shopping cart cover
__label__neg	"""However, the fact that the cap won't close anymore, totally defeates my whole environmentally conscious purpose!"""
__label__neg	All of a sudden, her hands were no longer playing with the toys or up in the air and we would peek under the jumparoo and see them dangling out the leg holes.
__label__neu	I have so many pictures of my son smiling with a giraffe's foot dangling out of one side of his mouth.  
__label__neg	The velcro was not strong and the way it contoured to my babys body was not smoothing to my daughter.. SO buy 1,  receive 1 and if your baby likes it... maybe it will work but it was to no AVAIL for me...
__label__pos	I have tried them all and this one is great.
__label__neg	We bought this several times at a baby store and had to toss them all out. 
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	It is just such a nice change from the baby blue with pastel colored bedding sets.  
__label__pos	and YES i would recommend to anyone if they have shorter legs!
__label__pos	I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road.
__label__pos	It includes everything you'll need for baby well care in a convenient storage pouch.
__label__neu	Small on counter space, big on drying space
__label__pos	Even thought they were slow flow the formula still spurted out much faster than the Playtex.
__label__pos	don't think about it, just get this one.
__label__neu	I have spilt soda a couple of times so if you have a drink that is in a can I would recommend drinking half of it before putting it in the holder
__label__pos	This pump is great, my baby girl is 7 months old and I'm still pumping away for milk in her cereal. 
__label__neu	We chose in the end to just have a small garbage can in our daughter's room and a natural scent deodorizer in the bottom.
__label__pos	Well worth the extra $$.
__label__neg	 Which in turn would leave your wipes so wet you might as well use a wet towel
__label__pos	He has an Avent one he will suck for a long time though. 
__label__neg	The music is great quality, although i wish it had an even lower volume setting.
__label__pos	But still felt like the pillows did the trick.
__label__neg	 So we had to use sharpie pens to mark the ounces
__label__pos	We haven't had any problems with pieces breaking off or the plastic being brittle and we adjust it almost daily.
__label__neu	20 or so wipes were not as wet as they should have been,  but the last one was fried.
__label__neu	In the S.
__label__neg	We used nothing but Avent bottles with my first child (3 years ago) and we loved them.
__label__neu	Your baby will not touch anything on the actual cart
__label__neu	I'm guessing the mesh is too distracting or annoying to them(?) She would just shake it around,  bang it,  or throw it.
__label__pos	"""I don't think I'll be able to nurse him descretely for much longer as he grows but for a newborn its perfect."""
__label__pos	"""You cannot go wrong with this."""
__label__pos	There was no question; we'd get the center for him.
__label__pos	He likes Freddie the firefly much better.
__label__pos	One of the best baby-proofing investments we've made
__label__neg	I found the 3 minute letdown feature annoying on it.
__label__neu	It is not easy to break down and transport.  
__label__pos	I bought this for my daughter because it is spill proof, looks nice and has a soft silicon spout. 
__label__neu	It's nice to be able to roll it up for taking into a restaurant for a highchair or if you're short on space in your car (I usually just throw it in my car without bothering to roll it up though
__label__neu	Our son is 3 months old and fairly long,  25 inches.
__label__pos	He began using this on the countertop in the bathroom at about 7 months.
__label__neu	I used lanolin on the sore one and it's not so bad when I get him at the right angle.
__label__pos	Granted, it costs a good bit more than those little cups at a local Dollar Tree, but hey, isn't it worth it not to have to clean up after your little one AND the grandparents? ;-) 
__label__neg	THE FRAME WAS ONLY TWO DOLLARS AND IS MORE STURDIER THAN THIS FLIMSY PIECE OF PLASTIC
__label__neg	"While I haven't tried the ""new and improved"" Diaper Genie,  in reading the reviews it sounds like they haven't improved on the biggest issue,  which is setting the thing back up after you empty it"
__label__neu	"""here is a tip when placing it: wet the bottom, place 1/2 of it on the table and push down firmly and then push the other 1/2 down onto the table."""
__label__pos	This pump is the best for a stay at home mom.
__label__neg	Waste of money and time in assembly
__label__neg	If you do happen to lose your lock you can buy a strong magnet from your home improvement store and still get it open.
__label__neg	I chucked it immediately.
__label__neu	The dangling fish and seahorse aren't removable.
__label__neu	I just about a pack of the sealing discs that fit the bottles (in this case Avent because that's what I have).
__label__neu	The valences hang down really low,  so we were unable to use them with our blinds.
__label__neu	I would not recommend this furnature,  after a year of use it has not held up well.
__label__neu	Update at 1 yr: still using this item.
__label__pos	"""It serves its purpose, though I didnt try it in a doorway."""
__label__neg	She is average length and it still fits her but is getting small at the armholes.
__label__neg	 But every time we put her on it, after only a few minutes she starts complaining that her feet hurt. 
__label__neg	It does NOT recline enough.
__label__neu	It continues to do this for as long as you're pumping
__label__neu	The price was good but it's VERY uncomfortable to wear and never sits on the body right.
__label__neg	The customer service is about the best thing I can say for this monitor. 
__label__pos	"""newborn and up."""
__label__pos	"""I love it!"""
__label__pos	The music is delighful almost hypnotic.
__label__neg	"""But after just one week of use it literally split at the seam."""
__label__pos	Very convenient to travel with compared to a portable play yard. 
__label__pos	"""But at 2-3 months he was able to turn around and look at the world."""
__label__pos	Does not take much space.
__label__neu	So we are going to try what another reviewer said, double sided sticky tape and see if that works.  
__label__neu	I got 4 of these for my 2 girls.
__label__neu	I can get a lot of things done around the house and actually watch a little TV.
__label__neg	 Brown system but was unsatisfied for several reasons
__label__pos	My baby was comfortable in it from the beginning and it is so quiet we don't even notice it.
__label__neg	If you have a child who is active or a wiggler, don't bother with these cups.
__label__neu	).
__label__pos	Maybe if you are not into the flashing lights, and the music, this would work great. 
__label__neu	I love it,  but wound up not using it very often,  as it has a lot of pieces to wash and put back together.
__label__pos	She loves it
__label__neg	Sorry Boon - I'm usually a big fan - but not today
__label__neu	You can use these bottles from newborns to toddlers.
__label__pos	 It is only slightly  more expensive but it is much nicer. 
__label__pos	I love this!
__label__neg	they are now in the dump and i'm out 25 bucks
__label__neu	My 11 month old is a very messy eater since she started feeding herself.  
__label__neu	I also found myself constantly attaching it and removing it to be able to get him in and out of the carrier. 
__label__pos	It now has a system to cut the bag on the inside of the pail, which is nice, and it has a lock for the inner lid of the pail.
__label__neu	 It makes more sense to buy something that securely holds any drink you might want, instead. 
__label__pos	This pillow worked for me,  despite the fact that when I started I was significantly overweight
__label__pos	It's really cute not ugly or ridiculous looking.
__label__neu	We had received one of these as a baby gift
__label__pos	"""They are soft and absorbant and leak far less than the two disposables I tried."""
__label__pos	It also comes with a useful book on taking care of your baby.
__label__neu	Used these with the Playtex drop-in system for my 3 week old when she started having trouble at the breast due to an ear infection
__label__neu	"This item seems like a good idea,  but after purchasing two I feel that we've fallen victim to ""new parent baby marketing""."
__label__pos	I hear so many people complaining about the smell and I have to say they're nuts
__label__neg	However after you are done nursing or when your baby out- grows it you will not have much use for it.
__label__pos	Still will play with it.
__label__pos	"""Now that our baby is a bit bigger it's also good as a snack carrier (Cheerios and the like) -- it's great to stretch out the usefulness of a baby product!"""
__label__neu	It works for infants up to 3 year olds.  
__label__neg	I used it once a day and it lasted 7. 
__label__neg	 But so far this hasn't been useful but the bath does seem like a good idea
__label__neu	Doesn't sound like much work,  but considering how many messes babies can make,  changing the pad gets to be almost a daily chore.
__label__pos	If you intend to go back to work, this is not the pump for you, but for everyone else I'd say this is a wise investment.
__label__pos	"""I used this throughout my pregnancy, and in those final days when you are so big and your belly is so heavy . . ."""
__label__pos	We walked all over Washington DC and the way the bag is designed to carry (it sits on your back), it was very comfortable to tote for a long period of time.
__label__neu	"""My new one is bright blue and neon green."""
__label__neg	Within hours we were getting horrible static
__label__neg	It does leak at the hinges.
__label__pos	Seat cover washes nicely.
__label__neu	It gives him alot of room to play and crawl.
__label__neg	It is pretty thin so it doesn't absorb or protect against any wetness
__label__neu	"""They ended up buying a different gate,  so it was a waste of money for me."
__label__neu	It means I only have to own one full cover.
__label__neg	Our son was not a large baby, but he grew out of this tub within 3 months.
__label__pos	During those 4.5 months he always had a great time playing in it -- and it worked really, really well to induce him to poop.  
__label__pos	He likes to spin the little pieces and/or watch me spin them.
__label__neg	 We started off badly
__label__pos	As far as some people saying it smells,  I haven't had a problem
__label__neu	These plugs are marketed for adults
__label__pos	Overall, we are very pleased with this product and would recommend it to others.
__label__neu	I should mention that I
__label__neg	 It is extremely difficult to get the cover on
__label__neg	I never saw any of them properly engage with it
__label__neg	Most importantly it is a failure as a two- room monitor.
