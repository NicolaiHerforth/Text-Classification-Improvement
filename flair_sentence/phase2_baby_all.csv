1,This monitor is decent for the price I guess.,pos,1049587200B00005TNIHA1B23P1EVL3EGI
1,But I think I would have rather spent a little extra to get something a little better.,neg,1049587200B00005TNIHA1B23P1EVL3EGI
1,The pro to the monitor is that it picks up the smallest sounds.,pos,1049587200B00005TNIHA1B23P1EVL3EGI
1,But the problem is that there's so much static that you can barely hear the sounds that it picks up.,neg,1049587200B00005TNIHA1B23P1EVL3EGI
1,There's so much static that it almost completely drowns out my crying baby!,pos,1049587200B00005TNIHA1B23P1EVL3EGI
1,If you run the monitor on just the batteries alone ( and unplug the AC adapter) then the monitor is pretty crystal clear.,neg,1049587200B00005TNIHA1B23P1EVL3EGI
1,The only problem with that is that the battery life in that monitor is only like 1-2 nights (tops!).,neu,1049587200B00005TNIHA1B23P1EVL3EGI
1,So if you have the money to spend on a new 9V battery every night or every other night then I guess this monitor would be okay.,neg,1049587200B00005TNIHA1B23P1EVL3EGI
1,But if you have that kind of money I would suggest that you invest in a monitor that is better quality than this one.,neg,1049587200B00005TNIHA1B23P1EVL3EGI

1,Our son absolutely LOVES this play gym.,pos,1109289600B0000936LRA2X423ETX2CX3U
1,He smiles laughs and talks at the light- up star and enjoys batting the toys to make the music come on.,pos,1109289600B0000936LRA2X423ETX2CX3U

1,All of our crib sheets are organic cotton but this one is the BEST hands down.,pos,1219363200B0014HQITAAWLK6NSSV0YNA
1,I thought all of our other sheets felt really soft compared with conventional cotton but this one is even softer!,pos,1219363200B0014HQITAAWLK6NSSV0YNA
1,Feels like a smooth thick organic cotton stretchy t- shirt.,pos,1219363200B0014HQITAAWLK6NSSV0YNA
1,The fact that it is natural in color makes it even more soft than dyed organic cotton sheets.,pos,1219363200B0014HQITAAWLK6NSSV0YNA

1,Our 3- month- old has been using these bottles since he was one month old.,pos,1222041600B000MRGML2A1F5O1USOUOOXI
1,The bottles don't leak at all and they don't cause gas.,pos,1222041600B000MRGML2A1F5O1USOUOOXI
1,I can only guess that the ones who had leaking problems don't know how to screw a bottle cap on.,neg,1222041600B000MRGML2A1F5O1USOUOOXI
1,At least one reviewer (maybe it was on the larger bottles; I read through those reviews too) seems to think the bubbles rising through the milk as the baby eats the milk is a bad sign.,neg,1222041600B000MRGML2A1F5O1USOUOOXI
1,They apparently didn't go through any physics classes on their way to their ged.,neg,1222041600B000MRGML2A1F5O1USOUOOXI
1,If there weren't bubbles then a vacuum would develop behind the milk making it harder and harder to suck the milk out.,neu,1222041600B000MRGML2A1F5O1USOUOOXI
1,So the bubbles are entirely necessary to equalize the pressure inside the bottle with the outside.,neu,1222041600B000MRGML2A1F5O1USOUOOXI
1,We plan to buy the larger bottles when he gets older and I might change my opinion then based on what I'm seeing in the reviews about the nipples that allow more flow.,neu,1222041600B000MRGML2A1F5O1USOUOOXI

1,Our diaper changing area was on the first floor in the laundry room.,neu,1134000000B0009A4FBQA3TMUD4J0MOAA8
1,We put a changing pad on top of the dryer so we wouldn't have to run upstairs all the time to change diapers (we had 2 children in diapers at the same time) well soon we started to notice an odor and it didn't go away.,neg,1134000000B0009A4FBQA3TMUD4J0MOAA8
1,We came to realize that the pail itself was absorbing the odors and we could not get rid of the stench no matter how much we washed it.,neg,1134000000B0009A4FBQA3TMUD4J0MOAA8
1,Now we just use an ittby bitty garbage can that holds about 5 diapers and we empty it out every day that's the only way to keep the diaper smell out of the house.,neg,1134000000B0009A4FBQA3TMUD4J0MOAA8
1,After researching various different monitors I purchased this one based on the reviews written here.,pos,1109808000B000S35QLCA3J8UGOK791NQZ
1,It is a great monitor!,pos,1109808000B000S35QLCA3J8UGOK791NQZ

1,It's very easy to use and the extra $10.00 spent on this one vs. the 9 channel model is well worth it considering that you get 3 times as many channels and a rechargeable battery on this one.,pos,1109808000B000S35QLCA3J8UGOK791NQZ

1,When we first bought our baby home we needed a place to bathe him.,neu,1247356800B000066665AY12DBB0U420B
1,So we purchased a bath tub device that fit into the kitchen sink.,neu,1247356800B000066665AY12DBB0U420B
1,It worked well and we got good use out of it.,pos,1247356800B000066665AY12DBB0U420B
1,However after about 6 months of growth the baby was getting a bit big for the tub.,neg,1247356800B000066665AY12DBB0U420B
1,My wife began taking him into the shower and that worked well too.,neu,1247356800B000066665AY12DBB0U420B
1,The kid just loves baths I should add.,pos,1247356800B000066665AY12DBB0U420B
1,Then my wife found this Munchkin inflatable tub which we're using at the present time.,pos,1247356800B000066665AY12DBB0U420B
1,The inflatable tub works well.,pos,1247356800B000066665AY12DBB0U420B
1,It fits our tub well and the kid loves it.,pos,1247356800B000066665AY12DBB0U420B
1,Personally I could do without the cutsie- poo duck head and tail as it increases the difficulty of storing the thing without deflation.,neg,1247356800B000066665AY12DBB0U420B

1,Not really.,neg,1247356800B000066665AY12DBB0U420B

1,But the tub itself works well.,pos,1247356800B000066665AY12DBB0U420B
1,He loves splashing with a little bubble bath in it.,pos,1247356800B000066665AY12DBB0U420B
1,Our faucet extends far enough that the tub water can be continuously refreshed.,pos,1247356800B000066665AY12DBB0U420B
1,The tub is easy to drain.,pos,1247356800B000066665AY12DBB0U420B
1,I just open the plug and wait for the water to leave (holding the plug open with one finger speeds the process).,pos,1247356800B000066665AY12DBB0U420B
1,I like the little heat indicator but my own testing by dipping my hand into the water is all that's really needed.,neu,1247356800B000066665AY12DBB0U420B

1,I've inflated this within a couple of minutes with no problem.,pos,1156377600B000066665A22JJMA7YFDUDS
1,Their issue may have been that they didn't read the directions regarding the valve.,neu,1156377600B000066665A22JJMA7YFDUDS
1,Many inflatable items have a closed valve so when you try and blow up the item you have to pinch the stem at the same time.,neu,1156377600B000066665A22JJMA7YFDUDS
1,This allows a little flap in the valve to open and let air in.,neu,1156377600B000066665A22JJMA7YFDUDS
1,The purpose is to keep leaking of air from the valve stem over time to a minimum.,neu,1156377600B000066665A22JJMA7YFDUDS

1,My daughter is a big newborn (10.8lbs) so her size may have something to do with the lack of safety of the sline but she is not mature enough to sit up in the tub yet.,neg,1234828800B000067EH7A3KJSCZZN0LZEG
1,Just be very careful with the sling and your newborn.,neu,1234828800B000067EH7A3KJSCZZN0LZEG
1,I bought this primarily because it takes regular trash bags we used it the way it's supposed to be used for the first couple of days but quickly discovered that as the pail gets full the dropping mechanism gets stuck forcing you to clean out the mechanism whenever it's time to change the pail and it's one more thing to wipe down if a diaper gets too messy.,neg,1174608000B00003TL7PA2YUH53E6Q6NHH
1,Also my husband would load the diaper into the top but routinely forget to flip it over to dump the dirty diaper.,neu,1174608000B00003TL7PA2YUH53E6Q6NHH

1,My little one loves this teething ring.,pos,1226880000B000J1OOJIAYNLVFJOV80CF

1,First of all we had to use a pipe wrench to get the thing unscrewed it was so tight neither dh or I could get it to budge and even w/ the pipe wrench it was a challenge Then there was no way I could get the arrow to line up w/ the square unless I used the pipe wrench hmmm not sure I want to carry a pipe wrench around with me when I need to pump  Oh and the suction is horrible.,neg,1151712000B00008GYD0A38GJX2ULM3VUC
1,I have the Avent Isis but wanted something I could pump directly into the Soothie bottles stupid choice the Avent is about 10000 times better even with more parts to clean well worth the time and money  With the Avent Isis I can pump 6-10 oz in 5 minutes this one I was lucky to get an ounce in 5 minutes don't waste your money.,neg,1151712000B00008GYD0A38GJX2ULM3VUC

1,My son loves it and it keeps him entertained for a long time - much longer than a regular saucer.,pos,1076457600B00006C29HA3DETJ3SIGHPWI
1,My eight month old hits himself in the face with most of his toys and this has not been a problem with the step and play.,pos,1076457600B00006C29HA3DETJ3SIGHPWI
1,It is possible with the two toys on the end but I haven't seen them do damage yet.,neu,1076457600B00006C29HA3DETJ3SIGHPWI

1,I have no idea why it got such positive reviews.,neg,1239321600B001BPQZ2KA3RZ7PL8FUXP3K
1,It's just a long long piece of elastic cloth (like 8 ft by 2 1/2 ft) which I could have easily stitched myself.,neu,1239321600B001BPQZ2KA3RZ7PL8FUXP3K
1,It's not something where you can put a baby in right away and be on the go.,neg,1239321600B001BPQZ2KA3RZ7PL8FUXP3K
1,Each wrap session takes like 5 minutes and if it becomes loose or undone you have to unwrap to rewrap it with both hands (and the baby might fall out while you're doing this).,neg,1239321600B001BPQZ2KA3RZ7PL8FUXP3K
1,I bought this set hoping that despite the low price it would work based on the reviews on this site.,pos,1235174400B000E0KN5IA2AWX3URCC89GE
1,Well not for us- we get horrible static reception/feedback despite moving the monitors to several different areas in the house.,neg,1235174400B000E0KN5IA2AWX3URCC89GE
1,I really like the light sensor option on the front and wished these would have worked out for us.,neu,1235174400B000E0KN5IA2AWX3URCC89GE

1,I'll be returning this back to Amazon,neu,1235174400B000E0KN5IA2AWX3URCC89GE
1,We bought this item after extensive in- store (babies r us) research.,neu,1261612800B001LF3X66A1F5B5JX6671OG
1,Most of the in- store models are cheaply built and expensive.,neu,1261612800B001LF3X66A1F5B5JX6671OG
1,This bag has a nice changing pad as well as sufficient volume to store a newborn necessities.,pos,1261612800B001LF3X66A1F5B5JX6671OG
1,We will see if this holds true later when the baby grows.,neu,1261612800B001LF3X66A1F5B5JX6671OG
1,I own this product and the Baby Bjorn.,neu,1101859200B000096L4FA2DS8P8OPUEUEO
1,My baby does not seem to like the NoJo very much and I prefer the Bjorn in almost all aspects.,neg,1101859200B000096L4FA2DS8P8OPUEUEO
1,This product is more difficult to use and less secure.,neg,1101859200B000096L4FA2DS8P8OPUEUEO
1,The position of the baby can shift with your movement (ie. if you go from sitting to standing or if you need to lean over a little bit ); that disrupts and upsets my baby.,neg,1101859200B000096L4FA2DS8P8OPUEUEO
1,Although you can breastfeed in it I think it is easier to remove the baby from the sling before nursing (but i have to admit that I feel the same way about the Bjorn and also feel pretty comfortable nursing in public).,neu,1101859200B000096L4FA2DS8P8OPUEUEO
1,The Bjorn holds your baby closer to your body and heartbeat and my baby definatly prefers that.,neg,1101859200B000096L4FA2DS8P8OPUEUEO
1,For an infant the inward facing position of the Bjorn is also more protective from strangers and germs.,neg,1101859200B000096L4FA2DS8P8OPUEUEO
1,Maybe I'll like this product better when  my baby is a little bigger.,neu,1101859200B000096L4FA2DS8P8OPUEUEO
1,I do use it at times when I don't have to also deal with my toddler but the physical demands of a three year old require too much movement to safely use the sling.,neg,1101859200B000096L4FA2DS8P8OPUEUEO
1,It does distribute the weight pretty well and is a welcome break to the shoulder fatigue sometimes caused by the Bjorn.,pos,1101859200B000096L4FA2DS8P8OPUEUEO
1,It is also better if you are eating reading or writing because the baby rides much lower.,pos,1101859200B000096L4FA2DS8P8OPUEUEO
1,My doctor gave me the sad news that I wasnt producing enough milk for my baby and that I would have to supplement after each feeding.,neu,1099958400B00008614FA3PPXFIVMJ9MV8
1,I had placed this set on my registry because I knew I wanted to pump my supply to bottle feed.,neu,1099958400B00008614FA3PPXFIVMJ9MV8
1,Our daughter was able to go back and forth between breat and bottle at each feeding very easily.,pos,1099958400B00008614FA3PPXFIVMJ9MV8
1,It was rocky the first 2 days but afterward smoothe sailing!,neu,1099958400B00008614FA3PPXFIVMJ9MV8

1,The nipples fit securely and I have never had any problems leaking.,pos,1099958400B00008614FA3PPXFIVMJ9MV8
1,The drop- in bags are disposable but very very durable I give them a good washing and reuse them!,pos,1099958400B00008614FA3PPXFIVMJ9MV8
1,Also we had Avent bottles too these nipples were much harder and much longer.,pos,1099958400B00008614FA3PPXFIVMJ9MV8
1,Even thought they were slow flow the formula still spurted out much faster than the Playtex.,pos,1099958400B00008614FA3PPXFIVMJ9MV8
1,We tried going back and forth btwn breast/bottle using the Avent bottles but our daughter would get so frustrated and VERY messy.,neg,1099958400B00008614FA3PPXFIVMJ9MV8
1,This is a GREAT set I highly recommend for new parents whether breastfeeding or bottle feeding!,pos,1099958400B00008614FA3PPXFIVMJ9MV8
1,I don't use these as wipes but they're great for wash cloths.,pos,1247529600B0039VCRPIA1BCUSZK8O3W9N
1,Way better than any of the cheap terry ones marketed for babies.,pos,1247529600B0039VCRPIA1BCUSZK8O3W9N
1,For wipes I use a combination of kushies flannel wipes and bum genius wipes.,neu,1247529600B0039VCRPIA1BCUSZK8O3W9N

1,He loves it!,pos,1262217600B0018Z6910A12KBIU17GSSIZ
1,The swing always makes him sleepy so it is great to calm him and even to make him sleepy.,pos,1262217600B0018Z6910A12KBIU17GSSIZ
1,He also loves the mirror and the mobile he pays attention for long stretches of time.,pos,1262217600B0018Z6910A12KBIU17GSSIZ
1,The musics are also very soothing.,pos,1262217600B0018Z6910A12KBIU17GSSIZ
1,I think that was a brilliant idea of Fisher Price to make the music and the mobile to stop after some time but keep the swing going for as long as you want.,pos,1262217600B0018Z6910A12KBIU17GSSIZ
1,The timing is perfect since my baby gets distract for awhile than falls asleep and I do not have to worry about turning the music and the mobile off to save some batterie because it does on its own.,pos,1262217600B0018Z6910A12KBIU17GSSIZ

1,This is my baby's fourth SwaddleMe.,neu,1258156800B0009QYTIYA3OIM25YFT4SHD
1,She's outgrown the two small sized ones and still uses the large sized cotton one in addition to this large fleece one.,neu,1258156800B0009QYTIYA3OIM25YFT4SHD
1,This one keeps her very warm in the colder weather over her terry sleeper.,pos,1258156800B0009QYTIYA3OIM25YFT4SHD
1,The fleece is very soft but not as stretchy as the cotton material which I am able to fasten tighter.,neu,1258156800B0009QYTIYA3OIM25YFT4SHD
1,To keep the swaddle from riding up over baby's face you have to remember to tightly fasten the bottom velcro around the waist.,neu,1258156800B0009QYTIYA3OIM25YFT4SHD
1,This way even if baby breaks out the arms go up above the swaddle and not below which would push the material upwards toward the face.,neu,1258156800B0009QYTIYA3OIM25YFT4SHD
1,My baby sleeps very well in it naps and nighttime.,pos,1258156800B0009QYTIYA3OIM25YFT4SHD
1,She has also used the Halo Sleepsack Swaddles which her arms go through a sleeveless shirt and the swaddles wrap around the outside.,neu,1258156800B0009QYTIYA3OIM25YFT4SHD
1,I prefer the Kiddopotamus though because I don't have to put her arms through the sleeves when she's asleep which usually wakes her up.,neg,1258156800B0009QYTIYA3OIM25YFT4SHD
1,I leave the Kiddopotamus on her crib in the open position and if she falls asleep unswaddled I wrap her up in three easy steps.,neu,1258156800B0009QYTIYA3OIM25YFT4SHD

1,I didn't give it 5 stars because we had a problem adjusting the crotch strap.,neg,1223078400B000BMBU7OA1EQES77VU49CA
1,It is removable but we had to break out tools to get the metal part out of the grooves.,neu,1223078400B000BMBU7OA1EQES77VU49CA

1,When I began my research for a potty chair for my son I had no idea how many things there were to consider!,neu,1170288000B000056J7KAE3089XLYVPEL
1,I really didn't want anything that made noise or had lights but we ultimately decided on this chair because of the one- piece splash guard since I learned that it wasn't uncommon for little boys to hurt their tender bits on other chairs.,neu,1170288000B000056J7KAE3089XLYVPEL
1,It is well- made and sturdy; it didn't tip when my son got on or off.,pos,1170288000B000056J7KAE3089XLYVPEL
1,I think the main thing it did was to give my son the confidence to use a potty - his feet stayed securely on the ground and it was stable and didn't slip around.,pos,1170288000B000056J7KAE3089XLYVPEL
1,He had no problem getting himself on and off of it and he liked the 'responsibility' of dumping the contents into the big potty (I liked that it was easy for him to do that and easy for me to clean the  bowl afterward).,pos,1170288000B000056J7KAE3089XLYVPEL

1,I need real measurements.,neu,1095638400B00009X3Y7A3PPXFIVMJ9MV8
1,Though the large straps on the BB would probably extend enough to also fit my husband I wasnt spending a $100 and not be sure not to mention $30 is a lot less to have to spend- our budget really wouldnt allow for such a splurge!,pos,1095638400B00009X3Y7A3PPXFIVMJ9MV8
1,So we bought the Sungli and so far very pleased.,pos,1095638400B00009X3Y7A3PPXFIVMJ9MV8
1,I would have given it 5- stars but in comparison the BBjorn has more cushion in the straps BUT it is more difficult to un- do the straps- maybe that is because you need to break them in- not sure didnt buy it.,neu,1095638400B00009X3Y7A3PPXFIVMJ9MV8

1,We have this hanging on the baby's crib and it's very soothing for the baby.,pos,1255824000B0001WAO8UAAXHHIUUTIB3J
1,One thing I did though was actually pulled the little speaker device out so it hangs outside of the bear's belly and it makes it nice and loud because it isn't being muffled from the inside stuffing of the bear.,neu,1255824000B0001WAO8UAAXHHIUUTIB3J

1,Most other playyards are dark and the mesh is dark so your baby can't see out and therefore wants to get out asap.,pos,1185321600B000056C86A3FDG1ASGMUQSL

1,When our boy was about four months old we took him into Babies R Us to see what type of activity toys he might like.,neu,1243987200B000WJPCFWAY12DBB0U420B
1,We looked at a variety of things that neither my wife the boy or I had any particular interest in.,neu,1243987200B000WJPCFWAY12DBB0U420B

1,I was sick of pushing my original Chicco Mamma High Chair around the kitchen and out of the way so I bought this.,pos,1185580800B0000DEW8NAHRNDSKWH1YBT
1,So far I am not disappointed.,pos,1185580800B0000DEW8NAHRNDSKWH1YBT
1,I have a hefty 6 month old (22lbs) that is comfortable in the chair.,pos,1185580800B0000DEW8NAHRNDSKWH1YBT
1,I have already used it many times at home and taken it out twice to restaurants.,neu,1185580800B0000DEW8NAHRNDSKWH1YBT
1,It seems to fit all kinds and styles of chairs.,pos,1185580800B0000DEW8NAHRNDSKWH1YBT
1,It fits snugly onto the chair so I am not worried about it falling off or tipping over.,pos,1185580800B0000DEW8NAHRNDSKWH1YBT
1,I like that I can remove the tray insert and still have a usable surface.,pos,1185580800B0000DEW8NAHRNDSKWH1YBT
1,I also appreciate how easy it is to clean with no nooks and crevices to get food permanently stuck in.,pos,1185580800B0000DEW8NAHRNDSKWH1YBT
1,It is easy to use and priced well.,pos,1185580800B0000DEW8NAHRNDSKWH1YBT
1,My only concern is that my son has already figured out how to snap off the tray insert by reaching his hand over and pulling up on the lip of the insert.,neg,1185580800B0000DEW8NAHRNDSKWH1YBT
1,I also wonder if the system it uses to attach to the side of the chair is a wee bit too flimsy.,neg,1185580800B0000DEW8NAHRNDSKWH1YBT
1,I am nervous that after months of taking it off and putting it back on that it will become loose and not stay on as well.,neu,1185580800B0000DEW8NAHRNDSKWH1YBT
1,Only time will tell I suppose.,neu,1185580800B0000DEW8NAHRNDSKWH1YBT

1,These bottles definitely help to reduce colic.,pos,1230249600B0018JWAF0A37FLDG237ONGE
1,The thing I love the most about them is the fact they are BPA free.,pos,1230249600B0018JWAF0A37FLDG237ONGE
1,It is nice to know you aren't putting unnecessary chemicals in your baby's body.,pos,1230249600B0018JWAF0A37FLDG237ONGE
1,These bottles are great because my son had such bad colic he was screaming when he would eat.,pos,1230249600B0018JWAF0A37FLDG237ONGE
1,The vent system in these bottles virtual eliminates any air from getting to your baby's tummy.,neu,1230249600B0018JWAF0A37FLDG237ONGE
1,The only downfall to these bottles is they are a little more labor intensive to wash and put together.,neg,1230249600B0018JWAF0A37FLDG237ONGE
1,You have one or two more pieces to put together over regular bottles.,neu,1230249600B0018JWAF0A37FLDG237ONGE
1,However if your baby has any amount of colic it is definitely worth the extra few minutes of assembly for their tummy's sake.,pos,1230249600B0018JWAF0A37FLDG237ONGE
1,One thing to note is at one point they began making these bottles with the ounce markers marked as raised clear numbers.,neu,1230249600B0018JWAF0A37FLDG237ONGE
1,This made is EXTREMELY difficult to see how full you were filling up the bottle.,neg,1230249600B0018JWAF0A37FLDG237ONGE
1,However I have since bought some and the markers on them are blue making it much easier to read the ounces you are making.,pos,1230249600B0018JWAF0A37FLDG237ONGE
1,It is not that big of a deal unless you're doing a 2.30 am feeding and trying to fill the bottle up without being able to see the markings.,neu,1230249600B0018JWAF0A37FLDG237ONGE
1,Overall these are the best bottles on the market.,pos,1230249600B0018JWAF0A37FLDG237ONGE
1,They truly do help eliminate colic and keep your baby safe and out of harmful chemicals way like BPA.,pos,1230249600B0018JWAF0A37FLDG237ONGE

1,I only have one of the ties down so far.,neu,1221696000B000N9H4SEAS7ZRG5D5XACX
1,When my little girl is sleeping in it she will usually sleep anywhere from an hour to three hours at a time.,neu,1221696000B000N9H4SEAS7ZRG5D5XACX
1,However she loves to stretch and move around a lot so she tends to squirm and get uncomfortable in the tie that I have her in when she's awake.,neg,1221696000B000N9H4SEAS7ZRG5D5XACX

1,However once there he is as happy as can be.,pos,1221523200B0012XLBFMA375NF45A1MDWI
1,I love being around horses and so this carrier allows me to run around the barn feeding and grooming without my little one getting underfoot.,pos,1221523200B0012XLBFMA375NF45A1MDWI
1,Also I have found that he doesn't feel as heavy and I can do a lot more.,pos,1221523200B0012XLBFMA375NF45A1MDWI
1,I am a little on the small size and so the straps are on the bulky side as the other reviewer pointed out however since this carrier takes up to 40lbs I think I would rather have bulky to spread out the weight than thin and not as useful.,neu,1221523200B0012XLBFMA375NF45A1MDWI

1,When my 5- month- old started teething my father- in- law tried to put crushed ice in a Zip- loc bag so she'd have something to chomp on (she wasn't a fan of chilled teethers).,neu,1098662400B000056JCYA100ZTESFDD58F

1,EVERY bottle I bought was a newborn bottle- with newborn nipples ( I double and triple checked) but for some reason they ALL had different flows!,neg,1049846400B00005BMDXA1B23P1EVL3EGI
1,Some would choke and gag him some didn't even work and NOTHING would come out some were okay you get the point.,neg,1049846400B00005BMDXA1B23P1EVL3EGI
1,It was always a guessing game with these bottles.,neg,1049846400B00005BMDXA1B23P1EVL3EGI
1,We had to constantly try to keep up with which nipples were the good ones and which ones didn't work.,neg,1049846400B00005BMDXA1B23P1EVL3EGI
1,And when you have a hungry fussy baby its no fun to be wasting time trying to keep up with stuff like that.,neg,1049846400B00005BMDXA1B23P1EVL3EGI
1,On top of the fact that we had 20 bottles and only 2-3 nipples that worked the way they were supposed to.,neg,1049846400B00005BMDXA1B23P1EVL3EGI
1,Another issue we had was that the nipples all colapsed!,neg,1049846400B00005BMDXA1B23P1EVL3EGI
1,It was horrible.,neg,1049846400B00005BMDXA1B23P1EVL3EGI
1,He would suck 10 times and the nipple would be colapsed.,neg,1049846400B00005BMDXA1B23P1EVL3EGI
1,I felt that these bottles were very poor quality.,neg,1049846400B00005BMDXA1B23P1EVL3EGI

1,Now that she is over the colic she still loves the swaddle me blankets.,pos,1128038400B0007WHCZ2A3I9J4BE0ZSTL5
1,It works so much better than swaddling in a regular receiving blanket because she can't squirm out of it.,pos,1128038400B0007WHCZ2A3I9J4BE0ZSTL5
1,She is very fidgety and therefore wakes herself up a lot if she is not in her swaddle me blankie.,neu,1128038400B0007WHCZ2A3I9J4BE0ZSTL5
1,She wakes up several times during the night without this but when she is swaddled in her swaddle me she sleeps 8 to 10 hours and she is five months old!,neu,1128038400B0007WHCZ2A3I9J4BE0ZSTL5

1,My son grew out of his newborn tub REALLY fast (3- months- old) so I bought this as a replacement because it was the only one I could find that was big enough for him to bathe in comfortably (and he was still not ready for the adult tub).,neu,1143417600B000067EH7AKH1QCEMS4ZI3
1,Then after a couple more months he really enjoyed being able to sit up (when he was able) instead of being reclined the whole time which made bath- time a LOT easier.,pos,1143417600B000067EH7AKH1QCEMS4ZI3
1,The two different sides (reclining/sitting) really extend the life of this tub and it is an excellent value.,pos,1143417600B000067EH7AKH1QCEMS4ZI3
1,I own an Infantino front pack and baby sling and found my  6 week old didn't really like either much but she will fall asleep in this and allows me to actually switch some laundry and walk to the mail box.,neu,1179619200B000N9H4SEA67RBWADAUAF6

1,Here's some tricks for this Champ.1.,neu,1133913600B00003TL7PA27A296IQHMDED
1,Put an Arm & Hammer Baking Soda box at the bottom of the pail to help eliminate orders.,neu,1133913600B00003TL7PA27A296IQHMDED
1,And the obvious change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.,neu,1133913600B00003TL7PA27A296IQHMDED
1,The side straps of the diaper will get caught in the shoot so make sure you roll the diaper really tight and use the straps to hold it together otherwise your diaper shoot will get clogged.3.,neg,1133913600B00003TL7PA27A296IQHMDED
1,If you're like me you probably have tons of grocery bags laying around.,neu,1133913600B00003TL7PA27A296IQHMDED
1,Keep a few handy in the nursery and use them to bag the poopy diapers.,neu,1133913600B00003TL7PA27A296IQHMDED
1,Double bagging them helps to eliminate the orders.,neu,1133913600B00003TL7PA27A296IQHMDED

1,Everyone says that all car seats are the same I think this one is worth the extra money.,pos,1151798400B0006HBRYAA1CY5ISF2ZWO45
1,My second child is in this one and my first is in his original Cosco one.,neu,1151798400B0006HBRYAA1CY5ISF2ZWO45

1,easier to install 2.,pos,1151798400B0006HBRYAA1CY5ISF2ZWO45
1,easier to put straps on and 3.,pos,1151798400B0006HBRYAA1CY5ISF2ZWO45
1,probably the most irritating thing about the Cosco is trying to adjust the straps and tighten them and Britax is a piece of cake.,neu,1151798400B0006HBRYAA1CY5ISF2ZWO45
1,I have had so many less frustrations with the Britax and it even has little velcro spots to put the straps on when you are not using them so that when you put your child in you are not mussing about trying to find the straps from underneath them.,neu,1151798400B0006HBRYAA1CY5ISF2ZWO45

1,I love this travel swing for serving it's purpose but as far as it's portability that left me with some gripes.,neu,1175990400B000BGFI82A1GWZBP7Z4PFY3
1,When the swing is folded flat the legs do not lock into place so they swing out as you are walking or trying to lay it flat in your car.,neg,1175990400B000BGFI82A1GWZBP7Z4PFY3
1,Also when I'm traveling with this swing I need to set it down to put the baby down and open the car door but there are no wide steady feet to set it down on you just have to let it collapse on the floor.,neg,1175990400B000BGFI82A1GWZBP7Z4PFY3
1,So you see love the swing wouldn't live w/out one of these but fisher price could have easily perfected this one and had the market for a few dollars more.,neu,1175990400B000BGFI82A1GWZBP7Z4PFY3

1,Summary.,neu,1235606400B000058DQJA2DIBHMU3EV1ZC
1,Works great for collecting leaked breastmilk and thereby minimizing waste; ventilated shells are great relief for injured nipples; appearance drastically improves if worn with a lightly padded braProduct comes with two soft bases (rings fitting around nipple) and two sets of covers.,pos,1235606400B000058DQJA2DIBHMU3EV1ZC
1,one ventilated (with holes) and one without holes.,neu,1235606400B000058DQJA2DIBHMU3EV1ZC
1,Pros.,neu,1235606400B000058DQJA2DIBHMU3EV1ZC
1,ventilated shells protect irritated or damaged nipples from contact with clothing reducing irritation and allowing healing without blocking air from the skin- ventilated shells can collect a couple ounces of milk (if you're mindful of the holes at the top)- solid (no hole) shells can collect 2-3 ounces of milk and have convenient pouring spouts- base is shaped pointing out which is desirable for flat nipplesCons.,pos,1235606400B000058DQJA2DIBHMU3EV1ZC
1,soft base (ring with hole for the nipple to fit through) can cause skin irritation if left on too long due to moisture accumulation- outward appearance through clothing varies greatly depending on breast size and type of bra used; seems to be designed to contour with size C at most,neu,1235606400B000058DQJA2DIBHMU3EV1ZC

2,"They do not go through loops that hang down from the bar, but rather velcro onto it.",neg,1108425600B0002ZOI9WA24ZVNHFYQPLAL

6,Our baby was almost exclusively breast fed from the start,neu,1115596800B00005BTNAA2RWZKHEZSFD8O

7, I was packing the car to go on a trip with him in it,neg,1090454400B00005NCAWA1ZH0ZCRHRTY33
7, IT was TOO tight around his stomach that he spit up in teh back of our SUV,neg,1090454400B00005NCAWA1ZH0ZCRHRTY33

7, It also ripped right on the inside of the curve where my shoulder hit it,neg,1200960000B0000635WIA1A9Q3CQA5Y28E
7," On top of all of that, you can't purchase covers for it, so I was stuck trying to deal with a standard pillow case cover over the top which just got tangled and fell off every night",neg,1200960000B0000635WIA1A9Q3CQA5Y28E

7, They are also more prone to getting lost and going down the disposal,neg,1209340800B000MRLYMYA357B3PUHSVQA
7,The cornerstone of Born Free's marketing campaign is that they are BPA free,neg,1209340800B000MRLYMYA357B3PUHSVQA
7, What many people overlook in their rush to buy BPA free bottles is that Born Free is hardly the only option (although they are probably the most visible),neg,1209340800B000MRLYMYA357B3PUHSVQA
7," Note that BPA is only an issue with polycarbonate bottles, not with the nipples",neg,1209340800B000MRLYMYA357B3PUHSVQA
7,They are almost certainly the most expensive,neg,1209340800B000MRLYMYA357B3PUHSVQA
7," This is particularly true if you price out the nipples, which are the only ones that fit their bottles",neg,1209340800B000MRLYMYA357B3PUHSVQA
7," For example, these cost THREE times as much as the Dr Browns replacement nipples",neg,1209340800B000MRLYMYA357B3PUHSVQA
7,We have a bunch of the Born Free bottles and sippy cups,neg,1209340800B000MRLYMYA357B3PUHSVQA

7, These are nice nipples but they also seem to wear out much faster than other brands we used before,neg,1209340800B000MRLYMYA357B3PUHSVQA

7, The only way you can keep a Peg Perego Primo Viaggio car seat from completely falling off is to use a strap that it somes with,neg,1208131200B000BMKEVCA17OWWQ2X3LNOH
7," The car seat does not lock onto anything, but merely rests on the bar",neg,1208131200B000BMKEVCA17OWWQ2X3LNOH
7, The problem with having to strap the car seat down is that the strap goes OVER the baby's chubby legs and/or belly,neg,1208131200B000BMKEVCA17OWWQ2X3LNOH
7, It doesn't leave much room for an infant once you secure the car seat to the stroller,neg,1208131200B000BMKEVCA17OWWQ2X3LNOH
7,The idea behind these bags is great - you can pump straight into the bag and store them,pos,1148947200B000056JEGAEMOL762ACFK7
7," The execution, however, is lousy",neg,1148947200B000056JEGAEMOL762ACFK7
7, Using twisties to seal the bags is cumbersome and annoying,neg,1148947200B000056JEGAEMOL762ACFK7
7,I prefer the Lansinoh bags with the double seal,neg,1148947200B000056JEGAEMOL762ACFK7

7," The differences, for 10$, are pronounced",neg,1251590400B000GE6S6AA39E8DC7MVKD70
7,The first two differences are quite cosmetic: the genie is a few inches shorter and it does not have a foot pedal,neg,1251590400B000GE6S6AA39E8DC7MVKD70
7, I didn't think this would be a huge issue,neg,1251590400B000GE6S6AA39E8DC7MVKD70
7, Boy was I wrong,neg,1251590400B000GE6S6AA39E8DC7MVKD70
7, This product forces you push the diapers through the opening,neg,1251590400B000GE6S6AA39E8DC7MVKD70
7, Now this doesn't sound bad until you realize that the mechanism used to keep the smell in is very stiff and requires some pressure,neg,1251590400B000GE6S6AA39E8DC7MVKD70
7, This really isn't the most hygienic method of diaper disposal,neg,1251590400B000GE6S6AA39E8DC7MVKD70
7, In fact in really messy diaper and you'll most likely want to shift the bag down some,neg,1251590400B000GE6S6AA39E8DC7MVKD70
7,The rest of the product is ok,pos,1251590400B000GE6S6AA39E8DC7MVKD70
7, Its quite easy to remove the diapers from the product,pos,1251590400B000GE6S6AA39E8DC7MVKD70
7, The razor to cut the bags is fine,pos,1251590400B000GE6S6AA39E8DC7MVKD70
7, The bag replacement system is well designed and easy to replace,pos,1251590400B000GE6S6AA39E8DC7MVKD70
7, However the fact you need to push the diaper through the pail's opening makes this product near worthless,neg,1251590400B000GE6S6AA39E8DC7MVKD70
7,what they don't tell you is this,neg,1227916800B000LEI82WAUVUTAC87UL1X
7," Graco SafeSeats are compatible with this stroller, which are supposed to last around a year or up to 30 inches",neg,1227916800B000LEI82WAUVUTAC87UL1X

7, My daughters are only 3,neg,1227916800B000LEI82WAUVUTAC87UL1X

7,"So, while I love this stroller for its ease of use, its exceptional maneuverability, its light weight, and the fact it's the only double stroller that fits into my Prius, that it's only good for twins up to 23 possibly 24 inches is a major design flaw",neg,1227916800B000LEI82WAUVUTAC87UL1X
7," If it were only a little longer, I would give it 5 stars",neg,1227916800B000LEI82WAUVUTAC87UL1X

7," No more crying from gas, she hardly ever spits up anymore, and she has a much easier time at feedings",neg,1085184000B000056HNXAKSEF1DI0KP8T
7, The flow is slower and it really does cut down on the amount of air she takes in during feedings,neg,1085184000B000056HNXAKSEF1DI0KP8T
7," So, I highly recommend trying something other than the Avent bottles for small infants",neg,1085184000B000056HNXAKSEF1DI0KP8T

7, I should have read more into it,neg,1208217600B00008ODBGA1JBMP0CDEEOW7

7, I dont really know how well it warmes up as I haven't been able to use it,neg,1208217600B00008ODBGA1JBMP0CDEEOW7
7,These diaper doublers are paper thin,neg,1234656000B000O8UGUMA3HHXQIUSY1TSH
7, They absorb very little as they are 100% cotton,neg,1234656000B000O8UGUMA3HHXQIUSY1TSH
7, I don't really see the point in this product,neg,1234656000B000O8UGUMA3HHXQIUSY1TSH

7, Then he managed to stuff one of the long legs deep into his mouth and started to gag,neg,1228521600B000IDSLOGA1W0WYJGOBU8UW

8,"The negatives there were a) sticky glue residue on the leather and b) when we need to fold down the rear seat for transporting bikes or something equally large, the rear seat would fold precisely right down where the mirror would be, so we'd be constantly removing it and the velcro tape and then reattaching it.

8,With all the electronic gidgets and gadgets out there spend the money and get the higher end models that really do block out interference. ,neg,1128902400B0000DH5TUA99QUDB6E6VBP
8,The real kicker of this was I was asleep one night while my husband was out working and I heard a males voice in the monitor. ,neg,1128902400B0000DH5TUA99QUDB6E6VBP
8,I immediately freaked out thinking someone broke into the house and was in the baby's room. ,neg,1128902400B0000DH5TUA99QUDB6E6VBP

8,Bottom line this is not worth the money - the interference and feedback is way too much - even in a house with no other houses nearby. ,neg,1256515200B0017T2RYUA95YEVPCYD3N1
8, Also it has a noise alert but no sensitivity function - so every time the baby makes a peep in turns on - which anyone who has a newborn will tell you means its going on every 10 seconds. ,neg,1256515200B0017T2RYUA95YEVPCYD3N1
8, The bottom line is you want a monitor that lets you decide what you want to hear this does not let you do that. ,neg,1256515200B0017T2RYUA95YEVPCYD3N1

9,I put this item on our registry because I was looking forward to being able to carry around the top from room to room and to wheel it around when necessary.,neu,1196553600B0002X7RYMA1O1BSSV5XCOHW

9,You have to string the twist-tie into each bag by yourself.,neu,1163030400B000056JEGA30ORX31JIA7BW
9,Also you are supposed to tear the little tab on the bottom of the bag to get the milk out.,neu,1163030400B000056JEGA30ORX31JIA7BW
9,It's not that easy.,neu,1163030400B000056JEGA30ORX31JIA7BW
9,The first time I did it I lost a whole bunch of milk.,neu,1163030400B000056JEGA30ORX31JIA7BW
9,Your better off untwisting the tie and pouring it from there.,neu,1163030400B000056JEGA30ORX31JIA7BW
9,The worst thing about the bag is that they have leaked a few times that my caregiver was warming up the milk.,neu,1163030400B000056JEGA30ORX31JIA7BW
9,This never happened with the other bags on the market.,neu,1163030400B000056JEGA30ORX31JIA7BW

9,"It is designed for cribs with a drop rail and so it comes in two pieces - one piece for the moveable side of the crib (the one that drops),  and a larger piece that covers the other 3 sides.",neg,1215475200B0013FGWD0APJ29ZG66KWX2
9,So it leaves 2 gaps because the pieces don't come together completely.,neu,1215475200B0013FGWD0APJ29ZG66KWX2
9,This makes it easier to drop one side of a drop-sidecrib but is pointless if you don't have this feature and looks funny.,pos,1215475200B0013FGWD0APJ29ZG66KWX2
9,"Also,  baby is always losing his pacifier out of these gaps.",neu,1215475200B0013FGWD0APJ29ZG66KWX2
9,I was disappointed that it looks like one piece in the picture and doesn't show the gap or mention that it is a two-piece bumper.,neu,1215475200B0013FGWD0APJ29ZG66KWX2
9,I ended up buying a new bumper and using this for the crib at grandma's house.,neg,1215475200B0013FGWD0APJ29ZG66KWX2
9,I would have returned it if it weren't for the shipping cost.,neu,1215475200B0013FGWD0APJ29ZG66KWX2
9,"As for the breathability - the mesh seems to be good quality,  just don't let the grabby side of the velcro attachments touch the mesh or it pulls and damages the mesh.",neg,1215475200B0013FGWD0APJ29ZG66KWX2
9,The fit was somewhat loose on my crib and hard to adjust it to be tight.,neu,1215475200B0013FGWD0APJ29ZG66KWX2
9,I am not terribly impressed - I wish it was tighter and also wish it was one solid bumper.,neu,1215475200B0013FGWD0APJ29ZG66KWX2
9,I received this off my baby shower registry.,neg,1203638400B0002XO5M4A1HCSAQPP45PM4

9,The right latch (when facing forward) did NOT latch tight compared to the left one.,neu,1203638400B0002XO5M4A1HCSAQPP45PM4

9,"If you own this,  CHECK the strength of the left latch to the right.",neg,1203638400B0002XO5M4A1HCSAQPP45PM4
9,PLEASE just spend the extra dollar to get a carrier that has an actual locking mechanism.,neu,1203638400B0002XO5M4A1HCSAQPP45PM4
9,This thing kind of just slide latches into place and offers no real security.,neu,1203638400B0002XO5M4A1HCSAQPP45PM4
9,"Please,  please,  please - invest in another one and if you own it check the integrity.",neu,1203638400B0002XO5M4A1HCSAQPP45PM4
9,I really can't stress this.,neu,1203638400B0002XO5M4A1HCSAQPP45PM4
9,"Just check the strength,  please?",neg,1203638400B0002XO5M4A1HCSAQPP45PM4
9,I don't want to read any other reviews besides mine of a baby falling from this carrier.,neg,1203638400B0002XO5M4A1HCSAQPP45PM4
9,You'll be able to tell if its faulty by just comparing how easily the left side comes undone to the right one.,neg,1203638400B0002XO5M4A1HCSAQPP45PM4
9,If they're both loose.. Than geez I don't know.,neg,1203638400B0002XO5M4A1HCSAQPP45PM4
9,Good luck.,neg,1203638400B0002XO5M4A1HCSAQPP45PM4
9,The mixer seems very handy but I could not use it as I intended because it would not fit down far enough in Dr.,neu,1257465600B00005BYUJA3687F2I2G6U8H
9,"Brown's 8-ounce bottles (regular width,  not sure about wide).",neg,1257465600B00005BYUJA3687F2I2G6U8H

9,It is very poor quality and I would never buy something from The First Years again.,neu,1253836800B0008JIL3GA37QPG0KDU5UPE
9,I'm not satisfied with Madela pump in style!,neu,1118102400B00065H55WA3CHKT5JI3XIFL
