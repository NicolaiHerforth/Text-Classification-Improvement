__label__neu	So we've taken it back and our daughter doesn't seem to mind the room temperature wipes that clean her cute tushie.
__label__neg	I bought this for my baby brother,  Jay.
__label__neu	He is my Mom's 1 year old foster child who she is in the process of adopting.
__label__neg	"Here is what my Mom said about the gate:""The gate seemed OK but was very light weight plastic and we didn't think it was sturdy enough to keep a strong baby like Jay from breaking it out of the wall and then tumbling with it down the steps."
__label__neu	"Most importantly,  the gate was not very tall,  only about 24"" I think,   The railing around the top of the steps is more like 32""."
__label__neu	We felt that baby would be hanging over the top of the gate and fall down the steps (Jay is already 33 inches tall).
__label__neu	"""They ended up buying a different gate,  so it was a waste of money for me."
__label__neg	If I lived in the same state,  I would just bring it home to use in my house for my baby since we don't have any stairs.
__label__neg	This product surely protects my leather seats but my car seat seat slides around on the seat when its in place.
__label__neu	i'm taking mine out of the car today.
__label__neg	I'll try it again when my son moves out of the infant carrier and into the big car seat.
__label__neu	I would not recommend this furnature,  after a year of use it has not held up well.
__label__neu	Very disappointing
__label__neu	My baby is an Advent baby.
__label__neu	I love all the Advent products,  but was a little disappointed with this one.
__label__neu	The bottle warmer,  is maybe too good of a warmer,  as it tends to overheat the milk even before the recommended time limit.
__label__neu	The timings really should be precise.
__label__neu	I got this pump while my baby was on a nursing strike,  and it helped me when I was engorged but even then it wasn't a whiz and now that I'm back to normal,  it hardly works at all.
__label__neu	The last time I used it (so I could have a night out) it took me 3 attempts and over an hour of combined efforts to get 4 oz of milk (wouldn't you know,  she only drank 1/2 ounce.) Even when I would finally get a let down,  the action/suction wasn't enough to keep it going.
__label__neu	Also,  I couldn't get the message cushion to work for me at all.
__label__neu	The instructions say to assemble the pump while wet to improve the seal on the cushion and &quot;diaphram&quot;,  but that still didn't help.
__label__neu	It would stay sealed for a couple pumps,  then unseal and seal again--off and on.
__label__neu	Very frustrating to deal with--makes it hard to relax like you need to.
__label__neu	Plus,  when you realize how many cycles the hospital pumps go through to get however much milk,  that's a lot of squeezing,  which is also not relaxing.
__label__pos	I was very pleased w/ the pump I used while in the hospital and am looking very seriously at buying the Ameda Purely Yours breastpump (as low as $140 in online searches.)
__label__neu	I already had a full size Graco Swing for my 2 month old but I needed a travel swing to take to Grandmas for frequent visiting.
__label__neg	It worked well for the first two weeks and my baby really like the hanging toys but then the batteries died.
__label__neu	After finally figuring out to replace them (takes a bit of a trick to get the battery compartment back in its slot)the Duracell batteries died again in another two weeks.
__label__pos	Overall the swing is cute and my baby liked it for a while but he only used for 1 month tops and he much prefers the full size swing.
__label__neu	Not really worth the extra expense,  stick with the full size or another travel model.
__label__neu	Arm's Reach really knows how to rob people.
__label__neu	These sheets are ridiculously expensive - especially considering how low the thread count feels on them.
__label__pos	I appreciate that they have velcro in all the right spots and are designed with the cosleeper specifically in mind.
__label__neu	But considering that this is an item that you'll need more than one of due to the occasional night-time diaper leak or spit-up,  it pains me to pay full price for them.
__label__neg	The washing label requests that these sheets be air-dryed (possibly b/c of all the velcro?).
__label__neu	I've accidentally put mine in the dryer a few times with out shrinkage.
__label__neu	But,  if you're the type of person who does everything by the book,  the air drying can be inconvenient if you don't have another clean sheet on hand.
__label__neu	I have tried using this since day one and every time I have used it,  it has hurt my back.
__label__neu	I don't find it useful at all.
__label__neu	For me,  it's easier to just carry my baby rather than put him in this.
__label__neu	If you are in the market for a carrier,  go for the Bjorn.
__label__pos	It's so much better,  especially on your back!
__label__neu	This is the worst pad I have tried.
__label__neu	They don't even have adhesive strips so are constantly slipping.
__label__neu	Go with Lansiloh or better yet Johnson and Johnson if you can find them.
__label__neu	I ended up throwing away the rest of the box!!!
__label__neg	I've now purchased 2 of these.
__label__neu	The first one we took with us on vacation and the video monitor screen failed.
__label__neu	I thought it was a fluke and retured it.
__label__neu	The second one I purchased about two months ago and is completely useless.
__label__neu	It is entirely static because of some interference with either the cordless phone or the wireless internet connection in my house.
__label__neu	Follow the instructions to the letter - this product will still smell bad after a few uses.
__label__neu	I HATE IT!!!
__label__neu	I've gone through 3 bathing things so far - and this is my least favorite.
__label__neu	First,  it doesn't have much elevation for newborns.
__label__neu	Second,  it gets heavy once it's wet and flattens.
__label__neu	Alternate product recommendation - Sure Comfort Tub by The First Years.... now THAT is a good baby bathtub!!!
__label__neu	Warning:  Don't buy products from Amazon's vendors.
__label__neu	This one arrived dented,  and the seller (set 4 baby) and Amazon refused to do anything about it.
__label__neu	There I was trying to get ready for my baby -- due any day -- and I'm dealing with a box sent with zero padding,  and a seller who told me that if I opened it,  they wouldn't take it back.
__label__neu	I sent it back,  confirmed by FedEx,  and they haven't credited one penny.
__label__neu	Their policy is a 15% restocking charge,  even though they caused the problem,  but actually they've not refunded anything.
__label__neg	We had no idea which monitor to register for & picked this one b/c it had two receivers and was reasonably priced.
__label__neu	It always has static and background noise (including our neigbors!but I'm told a lot of monitors do that),  so the red light is always on.
__label__neu	My son is still sleeping in our room so we hardley use it,  but for my own piece of mind,  we'll probably buy another monitor when he goes into his room.
__label__pos	One that doesn't have so much background noise and static.
__label__neg	I got these for back ups.
__label__neu	They are so thin they are see threw and not made well so they bend the mattress up.
__label__neu	I would return them but I washed them before putting them on.
__label__neu	So disappointed.
__label__neg	This is an OKAY diaper pail for the money.
__label__neg	It doesn't TOTALLY eliminate the smell and the bags are hard to change.
__label__neg	I don't even try any more to 'twist' the bag,  I just take the lid off.
__label__neu	It is very easy to open and I wonder about my son getting in it as he gets older.
__label__pos	If this is all you can afford,  it's not that bad.
__label__neg	This mattress pad is backed with plastic!
__label__neu	"It smells like plastic and the ""Organic Cotton"" title is completely misleading."
__label__neu	False advertising!
__label__neg	I've used this tub since my baby was born 6 months ago.
__label__neu	There are far more things I dislike about it than like.
__label__pos	I liked the sling.
__label__neg	I used it alone in the kitchen sink.
__label__neu	I disliked the sling in the tub.
__label__neu	I felt it did not fasten securely to the tub and there wasn't enough cushioning for his head and bottom.
__label__neu	My son now sits up on his own but I feel he can slip too easily in this tub.
__label__neu	This product is a great concept,  BUT it has a critical flaw for me.
__label__neu	The whole idea that I need to drill a big hole inside each cabinet door or drawer is a non starter.
__label__neu	I mean,  why would you spend money on a nice kitchen only to drill holes inside doors and drawers?
__label__neu	Hello?
__label__neg	Baby will grow up eventually so the locks are not needed.
__label__neu	What about those holes?
__label__neg	"It is cute that the manual says ""do not drill through the door, "" hugh?"
__label__neu	Why would I want to even have a drill near my cabinet doors?
__label__neu	Also,  what happens if say the door cracks while I drill?
__label__neu	Who pays for that?
__label__neu	I know the answer to that one -> ME!
__label__neu	Soooo....product is going back.
__label__neu	Non-starter
__label__neg	My 3 month old loves playing with this toy when he is in his car seat,  but he can now grab the toys and pull them.
__label__neu	When he does this the arch comes off the car seat and it has already it him twice on the head.
__label__neg	I wish that this product was designed better because my son really does love it.
__label__pos	If you are looking for something for a young infant that is still exploring.
__label__pos	I bought this for my ten month old and she likes the music but she is just too old for it.
__label__neg	All it does it says the colors and lights up with different tunes.
__label__neg	I thought it was a actual kaleidoscope but it wasn't.
__label__neu	I think I wasted my money on this product.
__label__neu	Baby Einstein is over rated.
__label__neu	If you want a good product buy Fisher Price...never unsatisfied.
__label__neu	what a pain to use!
__label__neu	who wants or can spend all the time needed to properly attach this item  to yourself and still take care of your sweetie?
__label__neu	cannot seem to get it to wrap tight enough to make me feel secure to tote bubbies around.
__label__neu	i would not buy this item if i where you.
__label__neg	We used nothing but Avent bottles with my first child (3 years ago) and we loved them.
__label__pos	We never had problems with leaking.
__label__neg	I researched bottles quite a bit when I became pregnant with my second child and although a lot of people complained about the leaking I decided to try the new BPA free bottles.
__label__neu	I bought a 2 pack of 4 oz bottles and regret doing so.
__label__neu	The bottles leak horribly like everyone says they do.
__label__neu	I have tried to play with how I screw on the lids,  or how tight they are (or are not) but the formula just pours out the side of the bottle.
__label__neu	What a waste of money.
__label__neu	I am shocked that Avent would actually sell such a poor,  quality product.
__label__neu	What are they thinking?
__label__neu	It doesn't fit my 5 month old and I ordered the 6-12 month size...cute but I guess I will pass it on to a friend with a newborn because it's not worth shipping back.
__label__neg	Followed the instructions re: cleaning with alcohol and drying... several times.Subway tile.Flat.Clean.Not crossing grout lines.
__label__neu	I dont understand why,  in these reviews,  its working in some cases and not in others.
__label__neu	Perhaps there are more temperature shifts in my home that arent in others,  and this has a role... ??
__label__neu	Whatever it is,  I (and others,  clearly) found this product wildly disappointing.
__label__neu	After a year of trying everything except drilling through my tile (thought about it!),  I just got rid of mine.
__label__neg	The first night I tried this,  my newborn slid down in between the bumpers.
__label__neu	This product is dangerous.
__label__neu	When my first child was little,  I had a manual baby food grinder that worked wonderfully but it has been many,  many years since I had it and I don't remember the brand it was.
__label__neg	I assumed that this grinder would work just as well.
__label__neu	It hasn't.
__label__neu	First,  I can't get the metal grinding plate off all.
__label__neu	Since I can't get it off,  I use a bottle brush and a toothpick to clean what I can't reach.
__label__neu	It grinds very soft foods well like previously frozen fruits and veges and bananas but when trying to grind things like steamed zucchini,  it is very difficult to push down and grind at the same time.
__label__neg	I did remember that the manual grinders did leak a bit from the bottom but I just placed it in a flat bottomed Tupperware container to catch the juice.
__label__neu	I really wanted to use a manual grinder but after 2 months of using this one,  I think i am going to take another reviewer's recommendation and purchase a hand blender and use for the next few months.
__label__neu	My husband and I are smart people,  but even after reading the instructions and following them closely,  I don't think we ever got this to work correctly.
__label__neu	We tried it when our daughter was 1-2 months old and no matter which way we had her in the carrier,  she hated it.
__label__neu	We never tried another carrier,  so I don't have a point of comparison,  but we hated this one so much,  that we brought it back to the store.
__label__neu	I bought this when my daughter was a month old and had terrible reflux.
__label__neu	Not only did it not help the reflux,  but I don't feel it was safe and it didn't hold up in the washing machine.
__label__neu	On several occasions,  my daughter ended up sliding down in between the side positioners.
__label__neu	She was very small,  born just over 5lbs,  and did not fit to well in this.
__label__neu	Because of her reflux,  I needed this to stand up to repeated washings.
__label__neu	Even with putting absorbant materieal on top of this to try and protect it,  she still spit up right through it.
__label__neu	When I washed this item,  it ended up being deformed.
__label__neu	Save your money and find something else.
__label__neu	This product is not grea.t
__label__neg	 The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is my daughter seemed somewhat comfortable in it,  that it until she fell in between the positioners.
__label__pos	I really liked the idea of this.
__label__neg	It does create pretty stars on the walls,  NOT on the ceiling.
__label__neg	It does  have to be pretty close to the ceiling to get a reasonable effect.
__label__neg	I purchased two,  and both have a radius of about 3 feet.
__label__neu	I place it on my son's night stand,  which is pretty tall,  and it barely reaches the ceiling.
__label__neu	Too pricey for what it does... which is not much.
__label__neu	Very disappointed!
__label__neg	I wrote an earlier review giving this warmer 5 stars because it heated the bottles so fast and the cooler portion made it easy to use anywhere in the house and travel.
__label__neu	BUT I noticed that the ON/OFF switch SPARKED EVERY TIME you turned it off.
__label__neu	Luckily,  I had kept the box so I just exchanged it for another only to discover the second did the exact same thing!
__label__neu	This is a HUGE FIRE HAZARD!
__label__neu	I have contacted The First Years about this problem but so far have not rec'vd a reply.
__label__neu	I even searched for information about Recalls on this warmer but found nothing.
__label__neu	Maybe it was just a fluke that I purchased the two out there that did this - but if I were you I wouldnt take the chance that there are more with this problem,  avoiding it altogether and buy a different brand!
__label__neu	Initially I would have recommended this warmer but now I say DONT BUY IT!
__label__neu	The on/off switch needs to re-designed before it is safe to use.
__label__neu	(I wouldn't be surprized if this gets recalled!)
__label__neu	Because this car seat perches on top of a base,  you must fill in the gap between the base and seatback with either a rolled-up towel,  which shifts,  or a waternoodle,  which gets squished down over time.
__label__neu	I found the latch extremely hard to fully tighten because of a lip in the plastic base,  which overlaps where my hand needed to be to tighten the latch straps.
__label__neu	So i had to pull the tightening belt off to the side,  from which position it refused to tighten.
__label__neg	From the front seat,  I could push the back of the carseat (in the rear-facing position) so that it would hit the seatback in the back seat.
__label__neu	If I can easily do this with my hand,  wouldn't baby be slammed face-first into the back seat's seatback in a head-on collision?
__label__neu	I got a Sunshine Kids after this and it fastened so tightly and securely in the rear-facing position,  I wonder how any baby is safe in a different seat.
__label__neu	the only thing my little girl has ever done with this toy is throw it... she is completely uninterested in this toy.
__label__pos	I love the look of this car seat and it's very comfortable for my son but it's also very hard to adjust the straps,  almost impossible.
__label__neu	Even my husband is unable to.
__label__neg	Maybe we just got a malfunctioning car seat since it seems most people love this one.
__label__neu	I thought that I just had to have this bottle warmer.
__label__neu	Boy was I wrong.
__label__neu	I found this warmer to be more of a hasssle than anything.
__label__neu	I used Avent bottle (which I love - no gas!!) so maybe the bottles are the problem - who knows.
__label__neu	The bottles were either too hot or too cold.
__label__neu	It is just as easy to install an instant hot water thingy on your faucet and make a warm bottle in seconds.
__label__neu	This product sounds like a neat idea (especially to first time parents),  but at the best it's pretty unnecessary and at the worst you'll end up with a flood in your house.
__label__neu	First of all,  you often make more of a mess spraying the diapers over the toilet (think poo water all over the rim and bathroom floor) than if you simply swished them clean in the toilet before throwing them in the hamper.
__label__neu	Besides,  once a child starts consuming lots of solids,  the diaper contents pretty much fall right off without any hassle.
__label__neu	Second,  unless you have a flexible supply line hose to your toilet,  this device won't be compatible with your system.
__label__neu	***Third,  the sprayer screws directly into your supply line and it is very,  very easy to accidentally loosen the connection (just by turning the thing off) and end up with a leak that could cause water damage or a minor flood.
__label__neu	I speak from experience.
__label__neu	Fourth,  don't even think of using this sprayer as a bidet,  as the water from the supply line is COLD (do you really want ice water spraying on your privates?).
__label__neu	Just go low-tech and skip this product.
__label__neu	Avent bottles have more BPA than any other leading brand.
__label__neu	BPA free brands include Born Free,  Nurture Pure,  MAM,  Green to Grow,  Baby Life and Adrini.
__label__neu	(For those that missed the news reports - BPA is a chemical found in some plastics that a recent National Institutes of Health report indicated may be harmful,  especially to infants.)
__label__neu	beware,  as your child ages,  this system does not hide the odors.
__label__neu	We have twins thus,  two bins and the rooms that the bins are in STINK!
__label__neu	I am replacing them.
__label__neu	It's way too short!
__label__neg	My son outgrew it by the time he was 3 weeks old,  and he's average length.
__label__neg	Also,  he rolled to one side in it.
__label__neu	Big waste of money!
__label__neg	The quality of this product is fine but we only used it 2 or 3 times and now it's just taking up a lot of space.
__label__pos	It was comfortable for Baby but baby bath tubs in general are a hassle to set up and clean up and store.
__label__neu	We find it easier to simply have Baby bathe with Mommy or Daddy.
__label__neu	This was something we certainly could have done without.
__label__neu	If you're on a budget,  we'd recommend asking around for a safe baby bath tub like this one to borrow as we suspect most folks don't use them very long.
__label__neu	Buy the Diaper Champ instead.
__label__neu	The Diaper Genie's only redeeming quality is the fact that it closes at the top.
__label__neu	Otherwise,  it's kind of a pain in the rear.
__label__neu	I stick air freshners to it to compensate-I think that says it all.
__label__neu	I bought this,  I received another type of swaddling blanket and my baby HATED this.
__label__neu	She didnt cry more,  she screamed more when I tried to swaddle.
__label__neg	The velcro was not strong and the way it contoured to my babys body was not smoothing to my daughter.. SO buy 1,  receive 1 and if your baby likes it... maybe it will work but it was to no AVAIL for me...
__label__neu	My son hated it.
__label__neu	He LOVES the Gerber Transition cup (7oz...not the other Gerber cup.) and he's okay w/ the Avent cup.
__label__pos	They both have very soft pieces that go in his mouth and feel good...not rock hard!
__label__neu	Most sippy cups are extremely hard to get anything out of,  this is one of them.
__label__neu	Skip it!
__label__neu	I used to use the Avent pads until I discovered the Lansinoh pads.
__label__neu	The Avent pads are thick and smaller and they show through your shirt.
__label__neu	It's hard to disguise that you are wearing breast pads,  which is kind of awkward.
__label__neg	I also found that it tends to move (slightly) even when attached.
__label__neg	It's okay to use at night because it is thick and it prevents leaks especially around morning time.
__label__neu	But I prefer Lansinoh and that is what I use now even at nights.
__label__neu	They are much better than the Avent pads.
__label__neg	I purchased this item because I thought it would be better than the cheep drugstore bottle/sippy cup holders.
__label__pos	At first,  the product worked well and I loved the cute patterns.
__label__neg	I even bought these as part of shower gifts.
__label__neg	"Now that my son has 4 teeth he chews on the part that attaches to the bottle or sippy cup I have found the rubber ""grippy liner"" in his mouth."
__label__neu	This becomes a choking hazard.
__label__neg	Overall,  the product works but if you choose to purchase this item please remove it from your baby gear/stroller/car seat when you remove the bottle or sippy.
__label__neg	We were looking for something for our son when he out grew his little baby tub and thought this would be great b/c he could sit up.
__label__neg	The seat itself is a bit slippery so we had to put something on it first so he wouldn't slide (washcloth will do).
__label__pos	He loved that he was able to sit and splash in his new tub seat.
__label__neu	However we found it very difficult for just one of us to get him in it.
__label__neg	It ended up that both of us would have to be present to get him in the seat.
__label__neg	One holds him while the other worked his legs into the seat.
__label__neu	It also was hard to wash his privates as he was sitting on his bottom and you can't just lift him to wash it and his front privates were to squashy to get to.
__label__neu	We ended up washing his privates on his changing table before puting him in the bath and that was just becoming too ridiculous.
__label__neu	We have since bought a mini blow up bath (Babies R' Us or Target) and he loves it and it is easy to wash him and no troubles.
__label__neu	However it was much easier to control and felt safer with him being secure in the tub seat....
__label__neu	My daughter is a strong little girl and though she needed to be swaddled in order to actually sleep...she fought it most of the time.
__label__neg	I bought this item in hopes that it would be comfortable for her and easy to use.
__label__neu	Needless to say she unswaddled herself easily and could not sleep as a result.
__label__neu	Admittedly not all children make valiant attempts at getting out of their blankets,  however my little girl was pretty intent.
__label__neu	I never could use this item and had to revert to using larger blankets until she no longer needed to be swaddled.
__label__neu	After using both these bags and the Gerber bags,  I prefer the zipper-style closure of the Gerber bags.
__label__neu	I've never had a problem with those leaking or ruining my milk.
__label__neu	They are also much cheaper as you can generally find them at discount stores (Target,  etc.).
__label__neu	This is the most poorly made baby bath I have ever used.
__label__neu	It is impossible to get folded and unfolded.
__label__neu	When you do get that figured out then you get to deal with the stupid sling.
__label__neu	My baby kept slipping down and her ears would get under water.
__label__neu	She is now to big for the sling,  but to small to sit up in the ring.
__label__neu	I gave it a fair try,  but I had to go out and buy another bath.
__label__neu	It seems like a great concept,  but it is really just a waste of [money].
__label__neu	I don't think I will be switching from the Playtex Dropins I have been using.
__label__pos	The re-sealable bags for the Steribottles are easy to use and do help keep them clean.
__label__pos	Sterility of the bottles and the nipples is ensured by their being stacked,  one on top of the other (think Dixi Cup dispenser).
__label__neg	The bottles themselves are 8oz and graduated.
__label__neg	The nipples are fast flow.
__label__neg	The procedure to unseal and reseal the bag to get out the bottles is straightforward,  although probably not necessary.
__label__neg	Once you open the bag it is no longer sterile.
__label__neu	The need to carefully and only partially unzip the packaging for the nipples is tedious.
__label__neg	The nipples leak very little when the bottle is inverted,  but when feeding,  the flow is very fast (too fast,  much faster than a Playtex fast flow nipple).
__label__neg	The biggest surprise was that once you put the nipple on the bottle,  you can't take it off.
__label__neu	I discovered this while testing it empty and had to waste a bottle and nipple.
__label__neu	"This means you can't ""top off"" a bottle,  or add something to an already made bottle."
__label__neu	Forcing the nipple off the bottle breaks the sealing mechanism and renders the bottle useless.
__label__neg	The bottle is recyclable,  but not reusable.
__label__neu	There is a lot less trash with the Dropins.
__label__neu	I see no reason to switch.
__label__neu	We found this wasn't the best thing to use in the bath regularly.
__label__neu	It's a bit of work to wring the water out,  and you never get it all out.
__label__neu	It takes over a day to dry,  which means if you use it daily you can expect mold/mildew.
__label__pos	We did find it useful around the house outside the tub.
__label__pos	If you ever need to lay your baby down somewhere secure and don't have time to prep it,  this bath pad makes a handy pad that keeps your child in position.
__label__neu	Unless you put all 5 pieces of this cup together just right,  it leaks.
__label__neu	Putting it together is a chore,  very difficult.
__label__neu	The big selling point is how it keeps the drink cool,  well all but the milk that sits in the spout,  that gets sour quickly.
__label__neu	Wouldn't buy them again.
__label__neu	Yup,  it leaks.
__label__neu	Even when I screw the top on without the handles,  it leaks.
__label__neu	Same problems as everyone else.
__label__neg	"I bought this as an ""easy"" way to pump."
__label__neu	I originally bought an Ameda electric pump.
__label__neu	I love it,  but wound up not using it very often,  as it has a lot of pieces to wash and put back together.
__label__neu	As I got more and more used to breastfeeding,  I just stopped pumping.
__label__neu	Well,  I'm going to be out of the house a little more often and decided I should start pumping and storing and just wanted to do a little pumping at night before bed.
__label__neg	I figured a manual pump would be a little easier to use than hooking up the electric pump.
__label__neu	This pump is HORRIBLE.
__label__neu	It fell apart,  and I pumped and pumped and I got less than 1/2 ounce.
__label__pos	This cup is great,  my 6 mos old used it all on her own very well,  better than the others we've tried but we lost the internal straw after a week.
__label__neg	As the other reviewer mentioned the straw separated for cleaning which is great but also very easy to lose in the dishwasher.
__label__neu	Replacement parts are available for $2 bucks each plus $8 shipping from Combi and then tax so basically if you lose that one tiny piece the cup is useless.
__label__neu	I've been much happier with the Avent cups that have replacement mouthpieces widely available.
__label__neu	Have never lost any of those pieces and replacements are inexpensive.
__label__neu	this was a big waste of money.
__label__neu	remote didnt work and the music was grainy
__label__neg	I used this stool during my baby's first month.
__label__pos	It did make breastfeeding a little more comfortable.
__label__neu	But after the first month,  it became more of a hindrance.
__label__neu	You don't need it if you are using a nursing pillow,   like &quot;Boppy&quot;.
__label__neu	Pricey.
__label__neu	Better to borrow one from a friend.
__label__neu	Trust me,  I'm a hairstylist.
__label__neg	the comb's edge is very sharp.
__label__neu	it scratched my baby's scalp.
__label__neg	I meant not only a part of the comb,  the whole edge of the comb is sharp.
__label__neu	and the brush is so hard when you use it.
__label__neu	it might feel soft to touch but because baby has soft scalp,  it could easily rub too hard.
__label__neu	I wish I had never used these on my baby.... he had major skin problem on his scalp after using this.
__label__neu	just trust me,  please don't buy this,  because I regret so much for buying this.
__label__neg	I bought this kit because I have been using an Avent pump and pouring the milk into the Playtex system (a pain which kind of defeats the purpose of having a pre-sterilized system,  but the pump makes me happy and the Playtex nurser makes my baby happy).
__label__pos	I bought this kit excited that I could use the adapter and just pump straight into the Playtex drop-ins.
__label__neu	However,  it is only ever mentioned in small print on the box that the adapter does not work with Avent and First Years pumps.
__label__neu	Since these are two popular brands,  I wish they'd note that on the Amazon site and more prominently on the box!
__label__neu	I never wanted a tub because I was not impressed with anything I found but my sister got me this as a shower gift.
__label__neu	I just don't think baby is comfortable in it.
__label__neu	His leg was all scrunched up,  his head fell to one side (unpadded,  by the way),  and it was hard to fit it over my bathroom sink because it's a small round thing.
__label__neu	Anyway,  before I had the baby,  I bought my husband a bath head cushion (the kind you blow up) from Target which he never used (too girly I guess).
__label__pos	Turns out it is the perfect cushion (it has suction cups) to attach inside our sink and put baby in for baths.
__label__pos	It has grooves so baby's head doesn't flop everywhere.
__label__neg	I bath baby in no time and I have the water running because he loves the feel of water streaming down onto his body.
__label__pos	The cushion also allows me to flip baby over so I can wash his back.
__label__pos	He just lies on the soft terry cloth.
__label__pos	It's perfect.
__label__neu	Once again the world of baby gates shows that they have very little grasp on how real live houses are built.
__label__neg	"I bought this gate for the ""adjustable"" feature - I have baseboards throughout the house and needed a gate that could handle those."
__label__neg	I thought I had found the gate.
__label__neu	Brought it home and discovered the adjustment is available only on one side - rendering it useless.
__label__neu	How difficult would it have been to make both sides adjustable?
__label__neu	How often is there baseboarding on only one side of an opening?
__label__neu	This design strikes me as a good idea but the execution is ridiculously bad.
__label__neu	The designers apparently sacrified the 'adjustable' feature of the gate in order to make it both pressure- and wall-mounted.
__label__neu	That was a very poor trade-off in my opinion.
__label__neu	It's so hard to find gates that can handle uneven fixture points; this gate should have stuck to that feature alone.
__label__neu	Most irksome is that the product's packaging intentionally obscures the non-adjustable side so you can't see it's non-adjustable.
__label__neu	I thought that was sleazy.
__label__neu	This gate is going back tomorrow.
__label__neu	I did not like this  this tub.
__label__neu	It is very small and the sling is awkward and does not hold the baby securely enough.
__label__neg	I never even tried the shower because I switched to another tub which I am very happy with.
__label__neu	These changing pad covers are of poor quality and have not held up very well to washings.
__label__neu	In addition,  the covers do not fit the changing pad very well and pull up at the sides.
__label__neu	Unfortunatly there does not seem to be any other choices so I still use the covers,  but I also lay a waterproof multi-use pad over the top.
__label__neg	This way I just change the multi-use pad and I don't have to wash the changing pad cover very often.
__label__neu	Baby Bjorn was the pioneer for baby carriers 10 years ago but since then there has been an explosion in the market - slings,  front carriers,  pouches,  etc.
__label__neu	The BEST,  in my honest opinion,  is the Ergo.
__label__pos	The baby sits with correct posture (The Bjorn is not so great for the baby's spine) and the parent is not in pain!
__label__neu	I can walk for hours with my 20 lb baby in the Ergo -- not so in the Bjorn.
__label__neg	I took my almost 3-year-old to Target to try this seat out.
__label__neu	The crotch strap would not budge,  and the whole seat was very flimsy with tons of straps.
__label__neu	It looked so complicated,  and I could not figure out how to adjust anything.
__label__neu	"Very cheap,  ""plasticy"" feel to it."
__label__neu	I ended up buying the Radian XT.
__label__pos	The advantage here is it fits the 5 pt. harness to 80 lbs.
__label__pos	It's made of steel and is very heavy,  but we'll install it once and then be happy our little guy is safe.
__label__neu	[...]
__label__pos	I was so excited to order this swing.
__label__pos	My sister raves about her Ocean Wonders Cradle Swing.
__label__neg	I ordered this one instead because it plugged into the wall.
__label__pos	When I got it I was very pleased with the colors.
__label__pos	It looked so nice and the assembly was pretty quick and easy.
__label__neu	However,  it would barely swing with the baby in it.
__label__neu	Since we already have traditional swing from subsequent children I was really puzzled.
__label__neu	The highest swing setting was comparable to the lowest on my other swing.
__label__neu	Baby was not happy after being used to faster motion.
__label__neu	So I boxed it up and will be returning it tomorrow.
__label__pos	So far the return process to amazon has been very smooth and easy.
__label__neu	Go Amazon!
__label__neu	I choose to get a refund as the replacement would have been the same swing and after reading some of these review it might not have been defective after all.
__label__neu	I might have to try out my sisters in person before I decide if I will reorder the Ocean Wonders.
__label__neu	I bought mine March 9,  2009 and it's August 7,  2009 and it no longer works.
__label__neu	The remote with very fresh batteries will turn the music on,  but you have to shut it off manually.
__label__neu	The music is annoying so leaving it on after the baby has gone to sleep can drive you nuts.
__label__pos	I did really like it at first though.
__label__neu	It takes some adjusting and it does tend to move around.
__label__neg	i registered and received this item,  but returned it because i wanted to possibly use the baby snuggle nest,  but ultimately had baby sleep in car seat for a while near me,  and then when in crib she was swaddled and couldnt roll over,  and as for the incline i purchased the crib wedge that is the width of the crib unlike the smallness of this one,  which is great when your baby can finally move around in the crib.
__label__neu	this basically is one of the many items aimed at the nervous new mom,  but a waste
__label__neg	I got these because of the one piece no leak lid.
__label__neu	but just returned them today.
__label__neu	The lids do not stay on after being screwed on.
__label__neg	You can pop the top right off like a tupperware lid.
__label__neg	It is especially easy to do if the bottle is slightly squeezed to change the shape of the threaded lip.
__label__neu	As a matter of fact if you tighten too much the lid actually clicks through and opens back up.
__label__neu	I bought a two pack and thought at first that I one was a bad egg but the same thing happened with the second so I consider it a design flaw.
__label__neu	I choose these bottles because they are very popular but then realized that the size of them are so large that the baby never really seems to be able to get a good hold on them.
__label__neu	I started bottle feeding at 6 months and ended up having to switch and buy an entire new line.
__label__neu	After my son turned 1 began to wean him off the bottle and introduced the avent bottles again just to see if he could hold it and it was still way to large for him.....
__label__pos	I guess these bottles would work if you plan on bottle feeding a toddler with big hands
__label__neu	Don't buy this!
__label__neu	Total waste of money.
__label__neu	Chains always break.
__label__neu	Drinks spill.
__label__neu	Cups break.
__label__neu	Such a mess.
__label__neu	Sticks out so far you can't fit through standard doorways.
__label__neu	Go with a Jolly Jumper or Joovy Organizer instead.
__label__neu	Save yourself the headache.
__label__neg	I didnt purchcase my cups from Amazon but since I am looking for replacement cups...I thought I should leave a message.
__label__neg	I purchased the two pack of this Nuby no spill cup for my 13 month old at the time.
__label__neu	It is now two months later I put milk in the cup and began shaking it to make sure it was warmed throughout that I notice milk dripping from the spout.
__label__pos	These bottles do not leak so Iam thinking what is going on?
__label__neu	well upon further inspection there was a slit in the spout and the bars inside of the spout were all broken!
__label__neu	Had I not realized this my child could have swallowed the tip of this spout.
__label__neg	I just wrote the company today and am waiting for a response.
__label__neu	My daughter had silicone nipples that never tore and she has had teeth since she was 3 months old!
__label__neg	Nice cup but the spout needs to be redesigned.
__label__neu	Excuse me, ...but this product is so far from being odorless.
__label__neu	At first,  it was (maybe a little less than a month),  odorless then after that, ...there was nothing to get rid of the scent.
__label__neu	I even bought some odor discs but they didn't work either.
__label__neg	The only convenient thing about this is that you can put whatever garbage bag you want in it and even then,  the bag can hold many diapers.
__label__neu	I didn't really use this so it was a waste of money.
__label__neu	It took too long to wrap it around the body and get it on just right.
__label__neu	Would not recommed to anyone.
__label__pos	It was comfy to wear though.
__label__neu	I wouldn't say I am very happy with this pillow.
__label__neu	Maybe that's because I am not used to very thick pillows and it hurt my neck after I tried to sleep on it.
__label__neu	Also,  it's a little bit short and I cannot place my legs comfortably.
__label__neu	The cover is made of polyester and everything sticks on it,  and it was very unpleasant in summer - cotton would be much better and healthier.
__label__neu	But I sewed cotton covers myself.
__label__neg	The only 2 points I am giving to it - it gives great support to my back when I sit - I am experiencing some lower back pains during my pregnancy,  and for that purpose it is great.
__label__neg	So,  I hope I can use it much better when I will be breastfeeding my baby - at least it would not be waste of money then.
__label__neu	This was a waste of money.
__label__neu	We couldn't get baby to stay still in it.
__label__neu	I had to sell this stroller after one use because I kicked the wheels probably a dozen times.
__label__neu	Very VERY disappointing because I love the color and style!
__label__neg	"I'm only 5'6""  so if you're a petite person and not planning on any tall people using it then it may work out just fine for you. Or I suppose if you are a ""baby steps"" type of walker,  but I take long strides."
__label__neu	Wish the handles were adjustable- they needed to be an extra 3-4 inches higher.
__label__neu	Highly disappointed in this diaper disposal system.
__label__neu	For the price,  you would think that it would seal each diaper individually.
__label__neu	The less expense models (even the Wal-Mart brand) will.
__label__neu	We chose in the end to just have a small garbage can in our daughter's room and a natural scent deodorizer in the bottom.
__label__neu	The bag gets emptied daily and there are no smells of diapers in her room.
__label__neu	Much less expense option and works the same as this system!
__label__neg	The product works well,  in theory.
__label__pos	Locked the food in place with no problem.
__label__pos	Easy to grip.
__label__neu	But the mesh is super thick and large.
__label__neu	My little girl,  who loves food and puts everything in her mouth,  didn't want to put this in her mouth.
__label__neu	She tried it,  made an awful face and refused to put it near her face again.
__label__neg	I introduced at 6 months,  and then every few weeks after that.
__label__neu	I've since given up.
__label__neu	I don't blame her.
__label__neg	I tried to eat an apple slice through it.
__label__neu	I got hardly any juice and the feel of the mesh in my mouth was gross.
__label__neu	Very unappetizing.
__label__neu	Maybe if they had a thinner mesh??
__label__neu	I bought one just to try to keep the pad a little bit more comfortable,  but it is so thin.
__label__neu	At nine dollars I thought it would be better.
__label__neu	Well,  I put it on my registry and got it,  and I wish I didn't!
__label__neu	The handle does not twist the bag,  so it DOESN'T lock in the smell.
__label__neu	It just doesn't twist.
__label__neu	It doesn't cut through the bags,  you have to use scissors to do it.
__label__neu	The refills are really expensive.
__label__neu	And it doesn't have a foot peddle for no hands disposing.
__label__neu	My son's room always smells like you know what.
__label__neu	And it doesn't hold a lot of diapers.
__label__neu	I feel like I'm constantly emptying it,  which isn't the simplest procedure.
__label__neu	I down right hate it,  don't buy it!
__label__neu	I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWS THAT THE LID POPS MUCH TOO EASILY.
__label__neu	NOW I JUST USE WIPES THAT ARE NOT LINKED AND LIFT THE LID.
__label__neu	"ALSO,  THE WIPES ARE COLD ALMOST INSTANTLY SO YOU HAVE TO MOVE VERY FAST TO GET THE EFFECT OF A ""WARM"" WIPE."
__label__neg	My baby had terrible gas and colic and i was using the Playtex Ventaire natural shape bottles.
__label__neg	someone gave me an avent bottle to try.
__label__neu	I was desperate to find something that would releive her but this bottle was not it either.
__label__neu	i didnt find that the bottle itself leaked but the milk came out too fast and caused my baby to choke and spit up all over.
__label__neu	i was disappointed because the Avent bottles seemed as though they would be easier to clean and assemble than the Vent Aires.
__label__neu	after this i reluctantly tried the Dr Browns bottles and i am glad i did because they worked great the first day,  no gas or colic and baby slept all nite  :-)
__label__neu	i just recently tried the wide neck Dr. Browns and like them even better than the standard dr browns.
__label__neu	You Avent users might like the wide neck Dr Browns also b/c they are easy to clean and pour milk into like the Avents,  there are more parts but so worth it to releive colic.
__label__neu	Too bad the Vent Aires didnt work b/c they are the cutest bottles of the 3 though.
__label__neg	These blankets are a little too warm since it is a flannel-type material.
__label__neu	When you follow the swaddling directions,  it is like having 5 flannel blankets on top of her (count the layers),  and when we unwrapped her she was all sweaty,  even in the AC.
__label__neu	We had to make sure the AC was on 70 degrees every night.
__label__neg	She slept better when swaddled so we didn't mind paying the extra $$ on the electric bill every month.
__label__pos	I love the size of these blankets,  they were perfect for swaddling.
__label__neu	But if you are not a good swaddler they will break free of it,  I know because she would break out when my husband wrapped her but not when I did.
__label__pos	This blanket is also really cute,  I would have to say our baby did look really sweet when wrapped up in this blanket.
__label__neg	The blanket was soft when I first got it,  but with several washings they are becoming rougher.
__label__neu	I stopped using them and moved on to the miracle blanket which is made of a thin cotton material.
__label__pos	It is not as cute but it is much more practical.
__label__pos	When I first bought Snoogle,  I loved it,  as it was perfectly supportive as promised.
__label__pos	Then my toddler barfed in our bed,  and some of it unfortunately splashed on Snoogle.
__label__neg	Snoogle's cover had to be washed.
__label__pos	Snoogle's cover is very snug,  without a hint of stretch.
__label__neu	Snoogle's ONE cover opening is in a very awkward location.
__label__neu	I was so frustrated with trying to put Snoogle's cover back on after washing that I left it off and left the pillow bare.
__label__neu	Big mistake.
__label__neu	Snoogle's supportive secret is in its cover because when left without,  it's basically a flat blob of cheap batting that stores body heat like an extra-lumpy camel and then spits it back at you during the night.
__label__neu	Why do people devise ways to frustrate pregnant women?
__label__neu	Finally,  today,  I put Snoogle's cover back on,  and after a half-hour of twisting,  writhing,  cursing and taking two breaks ... I got the stupid cover back on but didn't even have a post-coital glow as an added benefit.
__label__neu	My recommendation?
__label__neu	Buy a straight but fairly flexible body pillow.
__label__neg	It's what I had for my first pregnancy.
__label__pos	We simply used two king cases to cover it,  and I had no problem curving it to fit between my knees as needed.
__label__neu	I got this as a gift and I wish I had a gift receipt to return it...I takes up too much space in the freezer and only holds 12 bags.
__label__neu	Before I got this organizer,   I used a tall rectangular snapware container with a lid; it held more bags and took less space in my freezer.
__label__neu	I'm definitely going back to my good old container,  I hope to find another use for this.
__label__neu	In London I use the Widgey pillow and so I thought this was similar.
__label__neu	I went to visit my parents in the US and sent one of these to their house.
__label__neu	It's not the same.
__label__neu	It's too soft in the middle and my baby boy was struggling while nursing.
__label__neu	It's not as solid and a great disappointment.
__label__pos	My London pillow is amazing!
__label__neu	I am so glad I read the reviews and purchased the original Embryonics one instead of the one made by Munchkin.
__label__pos	The sound difference is amazing.
__label__pos	I've heard the Munchkin one play in person and it sounds like it is dying and about to run out of batteries.
__label__neu	Seriously save yourself some money and buy an original one (even if it's used).
__label__neu	I got mine on ebay.
__label__neu	I just purchased this gate for my son to keep him away from my basement steps.
__label__neu	First of all the gate was not that simple to install,  I had to go online to watch the video.
__label__neu	I dislike that the screws are not better constructed into the gate and the plastic that is used to extend them is not that strong,  mine stripped under the presser.
__label__neu	The latch is not easy to open you have to use two hands which defeats the purpose of the latch being one hand slide.
__label__neu	I plan on returning mine and getting the one that I really wanted but didn't want to spend the extra money on,  I will know better next time.
__label__neu	We had our car seat checked at the local police station,  and the safety officer recommended that we not use anything under our car seat.
__label__neu	In case of an accident or a problem with the car seat,  using any additional product (such as this mat or an attached fleece covering) may void the warranty of your car seat!
__label__neu	I didn't care for this at all.
__label__neu	The thing that really turned me off to it was when when it came out of the microwave,  it had this plastic smell to it.
__label__neu	It doesn't hold many bottles,  especially since I use the Dr.
__label__neu	Browns bottles.
__label__neu	Trying to get everything to fit in it is a pain and time consuming & I have to do it in two or more rounds.
__label__neu	I prefer to do it the old fashioned way...boil a pot of water & dunk everything in.
__label__neu	2 problems with this bib.
__label__neu	1) It only covers a small area (even on a 12 month old).
__label__neu	"2) The biggest problem - my daughters hair gets stuck around the ""pearl"" strand that clips into the holder piece to keep the bib on."
__label__neu	She does not have a lot of hair.
__label__neu	I bought 3 of these and will donate the 2 unused ones.
__label__neu	I really prefer Bumpkin.
__label__neu	I tried using this pump for about 2 days till I got too frustrated to try anymore.
__label__neu	When I did get the proper suction the pump worked easily and my milk came down easily.
__label__neu	It was easy and quick.
__label__neu	However 90% of the time getting the proper suction going was the hardest thing.
__label__neu	Thee were times when I got so frustrated from having to stop,  disassemble and reassemble that I'd just give up.
__label__neu	Maybe I did something wrong but when I called the company for help they weren't much help at all.
__label__neu	Finally went out and bought the especially for baby electronic pump which is also about the same price and Im now a happy pumper.
__label__neu	We received this carrier as a gift,  so we didn't have much input on the selection.
__label__neu	We liked the idea of it being a front or back carrier,  however it just doesn't seem to work with our bodies.
__label__neu	Our daughter seemed to be carried with her head by my ear when I tried it as a front pack.
__label__neu	The plastic side buckles to hold the child in place were not that secure,  so when we used it we still held her for fear of them opening up - defeats the purpose of having your hands free!
__label__neu	We much rather use our FABULOUS Quattro tour system than this!!!
__label__neu	I received two of these as a gift.
__label__neu	"As a first time parent,  I thought they looked great for ""swaddling for dummies""!"
__label__neu	We used one for about two weeks only to discover that our baby (who only weighed 7lb 8oz at birth) was too large for it!
__label__neu	The velcro attaches acress of the chest/arm area even though there is tons of space for growth at the feet.
__label__neu	In order to get it to close,  we had to scoot her down and then fold over the extra fabric at the neck.
__label__neu	It kept flipping up and covering her face while she slept.
__label__neu	So,  we switched to using the sleep sack we received instead and it worked MUCH better.
__label__neu	Don't waste your money; just swaddle the old fashioned way w/ receiving blankets.
__label__neu	I took the suggestion of the other reviewers that said they got these free and I have a pair coming to me as well from Medela...Save the money and call their 1-800 number and get a free pair...
__label__neu	I expected great things from this blanket since Baby Bargains raved about it.
__label__neu	Save your money and buy an Amazing Miracle Blanket instead.
__label__neu	The velcro is annoying,  and my daughter could wiggle out of this way too easily.
__label__neu	She never got out of the Amazing Miracle Blanket,  even at 6 months (I swaddled her when we were traveling and she had a hard time sleeping).
__label__neu	Skip the swaddleme and get an Amazing Miracle Blanket.
__label__neu	I swear I don't work for them--it's just that the blanket design is amazing and miraculous!
__label__neu	Had this product for a while and were very dissatisfied.
__label__neu	The only thing you can hear is static.
__label__neu	We got now Greco and very happy.
__label__neu	These cups are made of polycarbonate plastic,  which is a known toxic plastic,  especially unsafe in food/drink storage.
__label__neu	Nuby makes other two handled sippy cups that are made of safe polypropylene plastic.
__label__neu	"Cups made of unsafe PC plastic are usually clear and hard,  while cups made of safe PP plastic are softer and ""clouded"" plastic."
__label__neu	I just never got the hang of this tub,  my big boy always winded up sliding around on the slick surface.
__label__neu	Save your eight dollars and just take off the knobs for a while.
__label__neu	I store them in a locked cabinet and then when I cook I just put them back on then remove them when Im done.
__label__neu	Then when your child is old enough just put them back on.
__label__neu	I have found this to be the easiest method of protection concerning stoves.
__label__neu	PS I also had the same problems as below thats how I came to this idea.
__label__neu	We received this as a shower gift and have tried over the last 4 months to get our son to use it.
__label__neu	The mirror is the only part he seems interested in and it only entertains him for a few minutes.
__label__neu	Colors are way to dull.
__label__neu	Wish we would have done a little more research before registering for this.
__label__neu	I would not recommend buying a crib set.
__label__neu	We have this one and it is cute,  but I found out after it was purchased that using bumpers is not recommended due to the possibility of suffocation and SIDS.
__label__neu	The valences hang down really low,  so we were unable to use them with our blinds.
__label__neu	Babies are also not supposed to sleep with a blanket on top of them,  so we have yet to use the comforter.
__label__neu	We did get the rug,  found the set of pictures that match,  and use the crib skirt.
__label__neu	They are cute in his room.
__label__neu	We did like that this set would work for a boy or a girl too.
__label__neu	When our Fisher-Price 900 MHZ monitor (bought in 2002) finally died this year,  we decided to read the latest reviews before selecting a new one.
__label__neu	At the time,  the Sony Baby Call 27 channel had the best reviews out there.
__label__neu	We're a big fan of Sony's electronics,  so we figured we'd be just as satisfied with the monitor.
__label__neu	What a mistake!
__label__neu	Yes,  it does give have good sound quality inside the child's room.
__label__neu	However,  we've had horrible interference,  no matter how many times we've changed the configuration on the bottom.
__label__neu	We do have wireless Internet in our house and cordless phones,  but these were not problems with our old monitor.
__label__neu	"Also,  this one randomly does a series of three to six loud beeps when it's on,  scaring our dog and guests (""What in the world is THAT noise?"
__label__neu	""")."
__label__neu	There's also a static-y quality that we didn't have the with FP model and it doesn't have nearly the same range as our old monitor (I could be out in the backyard and still get reception,  while this one sets off the range alarm inside the house).
__label__neu	I wish the reviews of the newer Fisher-Price model that replaced ours were better at the time we purchased this.
__label__neu	Of course,  now they look about identical.
__label__neu	We have debated about tossing this monitor altogether and replacing it with the FP because we've been so disappointed.
__label__neu	If you're debating between the Sony and Fisher-Price monitors,  definitely opt for the Fisher-Price.
__label__neu	Great.
__label__neu	So my wife and I purchased this ultra-convenient frame/stroller for convenience.
__label__neu	It worked great for about 8 weeks,  then one of the front wheels bent to where we couldn't use it anymore.
__label__neu	AND,  the front wheels would at times jam the stroller from opening up in the first place.
__label__neu	In concept,  a frame/stroller like this is awesome,  but Graco needs to redesign this and make it better and sturdier.
__label__neu	All in all,  a major dissapointment.
__label__neu	The chair is nice and nicely made,  but my son did not like it at all.
__label__neu	We used the aquarium swing more than anything.
__label__neu	I hate this tub!!! It leaks everywhere.
__label__neu	I do not recommend buying this item.
__label__neg	The quality of this product was completely fine but my problem is with the color choices.
__label__neg	The item I ordered was labeled as cream but when it arrived it was very much a yellow.
__label__neg	I would have returned it if I didn't need it right away as a back up crib sheet.
__label__neg	Otherwise,  the sheet is soft.
__label__neu	The range is not close to 2000 feet.
__label__neu	Our toddler was sleeping and we took the receivers outside so that we could visit our next door neighbor's backyard and it lost reception about 200 feet.
__label__neu	We even put the monitor in the window and it still didn't get the reception.
__label__neu	I had this un-neccessary nursery item thinking that my November born baby would be more comfortable... boy was I wrong.
__label__neu	The first time I used it,  I pulled a wipe out and noticed that they seemed a bit too warm for my baby's bum.
__label__neu	I had to wait a few seconds before touching him with the wipe.
__label__neu	This is my first big gripe.
__label__neu	If it was a big job,  I had to either pull a few of them out when I started chaning him or wait a few seconds before each wipe... a pain!
__label__neu	The second thing I noticed is the lid would not stay closed.
__label__neu	So now,  not only did my wipes get too hot,  but I could not use the top wipe because it would be too dry.
__label__neu	Wipes are not cheap and wasting a wipe is for that purpose is silly.
__label__neu	That was strike two!
__label__neu	The thrid and final straw,  and what made me throw this money wasted apperattus away was that when I got the bottom of the stack of wipes,  I noticed that the wipe on the bottom was brown.
__label__neu	20 or so wipes were not as wet as they should have been,  but the last one was fried.
__label__neu	Not worth the money or hassle!
__label__neu	The idea is good,  put your sleeping baby from the car to the house without the baby waking.
__label__neu	My daughter is rarely sleeping when we come home so there goes that good idea and when she is,  unfortunately she still wakes and wants out.
__label__neu	So,  I rarely use it and even though I rarely use it,  the motor all of a sudden started making a loud disturbing noise that wakes my baby anyways.
__label__neu	Its not worth the money spent,  in my opinion.
__label__neu	Save your money and buy something else.
__label__neu	My wife keeps buying Fisher-Price products for our infant.
__label__neu	I don't know why.
__label__neu	Most of the P.
__label__neu	O.
__label__neu	S.
__label__neu	products we have bought from them have either malfunctioned prematurely,  or have fallen short in expectations due to shoddy construction and/or poor design.
__label__neu	This product is no exception.
__label__neu	The concept is good,  but execution is terrible.
__label__neu	You will go crazy trying to find the tiny,  recessed screws on the battery pack,  in order to attach the unit to a crib.
__label__neu	In addition,  they easily strip,  even with the proper sized screwdriver!
__label__neu	This makes it impossible to either install the unit,  or to remove it!!!  Whoever designed the crib attachment battery pack part of this product should be fired Donald Trump style!!!  Back to the drawing board Fisher-Price.
__label__neu	I am rating this a one because of the color.
__label__neu	, 2007, 1188950400B000LSYLFQA3NRHI8DY4W6AZ, B000LSYLFQ, A3NRHI8DY4W6AZ, Marcus I am sure that this seat cover would work wonderfully,  however the color is so disgusting that I had to return it.
__label__neu	The color in the picture is not a good representation of the ACTUAL color.
__label__neu	It really a disgusting baby poop green!.  Believe me,  I am not all that into style but I thought that it looked modern and neutral in the picture and would be a little less loud than the others but eeew[...]
__label__neu	I bought the  Busy Zoo at Target and my then twelve-month old twins liked it very much,  although it did not take my son long to learn to tip it over and reach inside the hollow underside.
__label__neu	After a month,  however,  both my babies started getting their hands and/or fingers trapped and pinched in the two sides with spinning wood blocks.
__label__neu	They would cry and could not get their hands and fingers out without my help.
__label__neu	I did not,  however,  have peeling paint,  as others have.
__label__neu	I took the Busy Zoo away,  of course.
__label__neu	Interesting that the description for the product reads for one-year olds,  but there is a warning for choking hazards on the Amazon page,  stating not for children under three.
__label__neu	First,  the good: very clear,  no interference with any of our other cordless devices,  visual signal of volume/sound even if you've got it turned way down.
__label__neu	UNFORTUNATELY,  the battery has a MEMORY.
__label__neu	We didn't know this,  so we usually had it unplugged during the day (not always in use) and then plugged it in each night to recharge (besides,  if you didn't plug it in at night,  would you really want to be awakened by the beeping of the dying battery?
__label__neu	Sleep is precious as it is right now!
__label__neu	).
__label__neu	Now we can no longer use the monitor unplugged AT ALL,  the battery life is down to approx.
__label__neu	3-4 minutes.
__label__neu	Plugged in it's still great,  but it's a hassle to have to lug the plug around the house during the day.
__label__neu	I've contacted Sony,  and the replacement battery is almost as expensive (after shipping) as just buying a new monitor.
__label__neu	Disappointing.
__label__neu	This product is terrible.
__label__neu	I tried it on once.
__label__neu	My baby slid to the bottom and her face was completely covered.
__label__neu	There are too many snaps and buckles.
__label__neu	I got a sling from Hotslings instead.
__label__neu	It works great and is MUCH LESS COMPLICATED.
__label__neu	I found that when having a baby,  keep it simple and LESS IS MORE.
__label__neu	If you want a less complex way to carry your baby,  go to [...] and check them out.
__label__neu	After breastfeeding my son,  I decided to use the Playtex Nursers for bottlefeeding.
__label__neu	I thought the bags would be convenient and make clean up easy,  plus the bottles are supposed to be like the breast right?
__label__neu	Well,  my son got a lot of air with these bottles and did not like the nipples.
__label__neu	Also,  I tried both the Playtex bags and Wal-mart brand.
__label__neu	The rim of the Playtex liners is very thin and I had several leaks because the liner shifted as I squeezed the air from it.
__label__neu	I tried the Wal-mart brand,  which has a sturdier liner rim and did not leak.
__label__neu	However,  these cheaper liners are smaller!
__label__neu	If you compare them with the Playtex (both the 4 oz and 8 oz),  the Wal-mart liners are smaller in circumference and will not hold as much.
__label__neu	I absolutely could not get the 4 oz liners to hold 4 oz or the 8 oz liners to hold 8 oz.
__label__neu	Also,  if you need to sit the bottle down for a minute,  the air comes right back in the liner and you have to squeeze it out again before you can resume feeding.
__label__neu	I thought these bottles were a lot of trouble and aggravation.
__label__neu	I would rather scrub regular bottles.
__label__neu	The musical sounds don't sound like the real instruments,  they just sound like a cheap toy.
__label__neu	Also,  I thought each instrument would play its own melody,  how it would in a real orchestra.
__label__neu	For example,  the horn would play the background,  the flute a lighter melody,  then all the instruments would combine to create the true melody when the orchestra button is pressed.
__label__neu	But really,  each button plays exactly the same notes except with a different instrument.
__label__neu	I was really disappointed,  and my daughter prefers the music buttons from her Tiny Love Activity Center.
__label__neu	The ones on that toy are really neat.
__label__pos	I got this for my 3 year old daughter.
__label__pos	She simply loves it.
__label__pos	She loves the fact that she can take it off the charger,  and it turns on.
__label__pos	It allows her to turn it on by herself,  which is nice since she like to be independent.
__label__pos	It is very simple to lift off the charger and put it back on.
__label__pos	My daughter will lift it off,  wait till it comes on,  and then sets it back on the charger,  then gets into bed,  and she is only 3.
__label__pos	It is this feature that I also enjoy since in the event of a black out,  we have one light that will automatically come on.
__label__pos	The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because the only one you can have on a timer is the blue.
__label__pos	Otherwise it is perfect for kids.
__label__pos	It is great if they want to hold it or keep it on the charger,  it doesn't get hot.
__label__pos	Also,  they can simply grab it an it will automatically turn on to the blue/15min timer.
__label__pos	Also you can switch it to blue/no timer,  green,  red,  and rainbow.
__label__pos	Revised: I kept having it burn out and needing to replace it.
__label__pos	I finally upgraded to theMobi Tykelight GloMate Plus.
__label__pos	I ordered it back it 2010 and it is still going strong 2 years later.
__label__neu	Wanted to use the Avent line,  but baby just wouldn't take this nipple.
__label__neu	Went with Playtex ventaire natural instead.
__label__neu	Looks like a science lab...but baby switches easily from breast to bottle.
__label__neu	Look through the reviews and you can see many people upset about these leaking.
__label__neu	They are correct!
__label__neu	Because it only happens to one in about four or five reviewers,  I think there must be a problem with production.
__label__neu	Maybe some are leaky,  some are not.
__label__neu	Fact is,  out of ten bottles,  five of mine were leaky.
__label__neu	I ended up throwing the whole lot out after using more money on paper towels than bottles.
__label__neu	Save yourself the headache and get evenflo or playtex.
__label__neu	They are half the cost and never leak.
__label__neu	I would have to say that this is the worst tub ever!
__label__neu	There is just a little bump that is supposed to be the part that your baby stradles to be able to sit in the tub.
__label__neu	It doesnt work.
__label__neu	My baby just slides right off of it.
__label__neu	I cant even bath him,  as I am trying to keep him upright to wash.
__label__neu	For my previous babies I had the First Years Sure Comfort newborn to toddler tub.
__label__neu	It has a shelf for your baby to sit on.
__label__neu	Well I gave that one away and so I had to buy new.
__label__neu	I purchased this not through amazon,  but bought it at walmart.
__label__neu	I wish that I would have just spent the extra money and bought the good one to begin with.
__label__neu	Now I am going to throw this one away and purchase through amazon the blue first years tub.
__label__neu	Good thing is that amazon charges less than stores for the First years tub (well in Alaska).
__label__neu	Save your money and purchase the first years tub!
__label__neu	This bottle warmer was horrible.
__label__neu	, 2004, 1091664000B00005BXKMA12JF1M45OIDD2, B00005BXKM, A12JF1M45OIDD2, Marcus If you are formula-feeding,  just use the microwave.
__label__neu	Really.
__label__neu	It takes so much less time,  and all you have to do is shake the bottle really well to eliminate hotspots.
__label__neu	This bottle warmer never heated bottles evenly.
__label__neu	Sometimes they would be scalding hot,  sometimes ice cold (and then you have to wait until it's completely cooled down before it will allow you to heat it again!
__label__neu	).
__label__neu	Not only that,  but it always took a minimum of 5 minutes to heat the bottle.
__label__neu	Meanwhile,  my baby is screaming because he's hungry and wants that bottle!! The microwave only takes 30 seconds and it's the same temperature EVERY time.
__label__neu	If you're heating expressed breastmilk I can see why someone would need a bottle warmer.
__label__neu	Otherwise,  what is the point??
__label__neu	I used this bath for the first 3 months and it was great when using the sling,  but when my son got too big for the sling and was sitting up,  we tried the sitting position.
__label__neu	But my son would just slip down and would cry because it was uncomfortable for him.
__label__neu	I would not recommend this bath tub.
__label__neu	There are other tubs with slings that are much better.
__label__neu	These were SUCH a pain to clean and use - my kitchen looked like a science lab.
__label__neu	, 2004, 1091836800B00005BTNAANDCIRDLNLV47, B00005BTNA, ANDCIRDLNLV47, Marcus I threw them all out.
__label__neu	I have tried 4 other brands and these are the worst.
__label__neu	I haven't had any problems with leakage (with this or any other brand) but after 3-4 washes the Medela pads are so wrinkled and have lost their shape that I can't wear them with anything without them showing through.
__label__neu	I would not recommend these unless you were going to hand wash them - but who has time with a new babe!
__label__neu	Especially,  when the other brands are holding up just fine after the same number of washes.
__label__neu	Initially i loved the product.
__label__neu	Was huge enuf to hold the biggest bottle of garnier conditioner bottle,  shampoo bottles,  loofahs etc.. But in a week or so,  the sticker with which it was attached to the shower wall,  came off and the whole thing crashed into the tub.. Now its jus sitting in the bathroom occupying the space n not of any use.
__label__neu	We registered for this tub,  before doing any research.
__label__neu	Big mistake.
__label__neu	As a newborn,  I used the sling to bathe my son.
__label__neu	As he got bigger,  I put the sling into the tub (2nd way of the 4-1 system).
__label__neu	Bath time became a pain.
__label__neu	My son kept sliding down,  even with one hand on him at all times.
__label__neu	He didn't really seem to enjoy it either.
__label__neu	Finally,  after reading great online reviews I bought the Eurobath.
__label__neu	LOVE IT!!!!!  From day one my son had a great time in his new (huge) tub.
__label__neu	He fits securely into the reclined side of the tub,  with no slipping.
__label__neu	He is comfortable and there is enough water around him to keep him warm and for him to splash.
__label__neu	We've had it over a month,  I highly recommend the Eurobath over this bath tub.
__label__neg	I got this as a gift at my baby shower ( bought from my baby registry)My 2 month old son seems to like the vibration feature.
__label__neg	It's not his fav chair though,  he prefers the swing.
__label__neg	He stays in this chair for 5 minutes max before he yells to get out.
__label__neu	The music in this is POOR,  VERY VERY POOR!!!! It sounds like cheap  crap and I am disappointed cause I had really expected more.
__label__neu	It is the same quality that you will hear from a musical card when you open it.
__label__neu	I think they were trying to play twinkle twinkle little star but the notes were off in some areas.
__label__neu	The rainforest swing on the other hand sounds very good.
__label__neu	I will NOT recommend,  sorry.
__label__neu	I purchased this diaper organizer to hang on my Delta Luv changing table,  because there was no storage space on top.
__label__neu	I had high hopes for it--Munchkin products are usually high in quality.
__label__neu	However,  the cloth on this organizer sags.
__label__neu	When I tried to fill it with my wipes box,  baby powder,  and lotion--as shown in the picture--the pockets tipped forward and everything fell out.
__label__neu	I wouldn't want a toddler getting near this organizer!
__label__neu	"A much safer option is the plastic ""Diaper Depot"" by Prince Lionheart."
__label__neu	These bottles suck!
__label__neu	A complete waste of money,  maybe my daughter will use them to play with her dolls years down the road.
__label__neu	They are a HUGE pain to use.
__label__neu	For one you can't use a bottle warmer (the water seeps up into bottle).
__label__neu	We had to hold it under running water which takes forever.
__label__neu	It took my daughter FOREVER to drink the bottle from the nipples.
__label__neu	If you are concerned about gas use Dr.
__label__neu	Brown's bottles,  they have more parts but easy to put together.
__label__neu	We absolutely hated the diaper genie.
__label__neu	It never worked right.
__label__neu	After suffering with repeatedly having to retie the knot to start the sausages over we finally took it to the dumster.
__label__neu	We started using the regular trash can and emptied it nightly until we got the diaper champ.
__label__neu	We highly recommend the diaper champ.
__label__neu	Do not waste your money on the diaper genie.
__label__neu	I recieved boxes of these bottles as gifts,  every one of them leaks.
__label__neu	I tried everything to stop the leaks,  but nothing worked.
__label__neu	Avent makes a great manual breast pump,  but they need to put a better bottle on the market.
__label__neu	This is a piece of clear plexiglass that is the length of you dvd player and is angled at 90 degrees,  so that you attach velcro (included) to the top of the dvd player and then to the plexiglass and the other part of the clear guard actually protects the buttons.
__label__neu	It says that if your dvd player is too short to use the longer side,  reverse it and use the longer side of the guard on the player and the shorter side to cover the buttons.
__label__neu	I understand,  but it was still too big.
__label__neu	I have a Sony DVD player that is 1.
__label__neu	5 inches high and the short side of the guard is 2.
__label__neu	25 inches high.
__label__neu	So since the guard would not lay flat,  there is no way this would keep my son from getting into the dvd player.
__label__neu	I thought about putting a book under the player,  but I think he would just lift it and get into it.
__label__neu	If your dvd player is less than 2.
__label__neu	25 inches high,  this will not work for you.
__label__neu	This bath tub is humongous.
__label__neu	It needs its own bath room.
__label__neu	Too big to put it on top of a kitchen sink.
__label__neu	Since the only place I found for it near water source is inside our bath tub,  which places it practically at ground level,  my back is killing me.
__label__neu	Unless your are planning to remodel your bathroom to fit this monster,  go for something else.
__label__neu	Definitely not for a 700 Sqr Foot apartment in the city.
__label__neu	I returned this wipe warmer to the store when I realized that it uses a wall wart rather than a standard electrical plug.
__label__neu	I will probably buy the Especially for Baby warmer,  which does not use a wall wart.
__label__neu	Do you ever wonder why manufacturers use wall warts?
__label__neu	Because it's cheaper to get UL certification for a wall wart than to get certification for the whole device.
__label__neu	Baby is breast-fed and I registered for these so I could pump and my husband could feed her at night.
__label__neu	Our baby hated the bottle and wouldn't take the nipple.
__label__neu	The nipples,  on the Avent,  are too long and hard and would make her gag when she attempted to latch on.
__label__neu	We switched to the Platex NaturalLatch and now she takes a bottle.
__label__neu	The nipples on the Platex are much softer and shorter.
__label__neu	Baby switches between the bottle and breast now,  no problem.
__label__neu	It didn't fit well on my Graco snugride.
__label__neu	My daughter loved it,  but the song was so short.
__label__neu	I couldn't reach the button to restart the song from the driver's seat.
__label__neu	After I used it for about a month,  my pediatrician told me not to drive with it attached anyway.
__label__neu	That it is a safety hazard if I should get into an accident.
__label__neu	The hammock was a waiste!
__label__neu	, 2004 Tried to use it,  threw it out.
__label__neu	The seat is not deep enough,  my 4 months old is not even close to being covered by water,  when he's on the &quot;infant side&quot;,  but the other side is too upright for babies that already sit with no problems.
__label__neu	I don't know if that actually works
__label__neu	The tub doesn't really fit in either single or double sinks,  we've tried both.
__label__neu	I wish I knew which tub is better,  so I could get it!
__label__neu	I received this shade for free when I bought other products from Babies R US.
__label__neu	My windows in the back have a curved edge to them.
__label__neu	You have to place the shade high on the window in the straight area.
__label__neu	Well you miss the whole lower corner of the window.
__label__neu	The sun shines in through this lower corner.
__label__neu	When I tried to move the shade lower on the window I could not fully close the window.
__label__neu	If you can get it for free,  get it.
__label__neu	Do not purchase this item.
__label__neu	I just recently went out and purchased new shade for my car to cover the corner this shade misses.
__label__neu	These bottles are useful for storing milk....they are sturdy and fit in bottle warmers nicely.
__label__neu	My baby hates them for feeding,  however.
__label__neu	I now just use these for storage and then pour the warmed milk into Playtex Nurser bottles.
__label__neu	I bought the Medela system when I was pregnant b/c I wanted what was best for my baby...and I was led to believe that Medela nipples would be most like the breast.
__label__neu	Um,  no.
__label__neu	Take one look at them and it's pretty clear.
__label__neu	My baby wouldn't even take it in her mouth.
__label__neu	She instantly responded to the Playtex nipples,  however.
__label__neu	Much,  much better!
__label__neg	Great bottles when used with nipples,  terrible design with the sippy cup attachment.
__label__neg	Valves are super tough to remove for cleaning,   and they always are being cleaned.
__label__neg	I recommend the First Years Clean & Simple,  valve free!
__label__neg	sippy cups.
__label__neg	They don't offer them on Babies R Us online but the do have them in the store.
__label__neg	They have them in 3 sizes ,  with handles and they don't leak!
__label__neg	EVER!
__label__neg	When making the purchase do it right the first time.
__label__neg	Not like me 4 sets later :o(
__label__neu	These are almost just like a bottle nipple,  except the nipple is flat at the tip.
__label__neu	Maybe a bigger child could use this (MAYBE,  but doubtful),  but my 1 year old hates it.
__label__neu	The nippe is just too strange and really is pointless.
__label__neg	I have been searching for a way to keep my 3-year-old out of her closet,  and so I was thrilled when I found this product.
__label__neg	However,  it won't stay on the door.
__label__neg	First I tried the original sticker-thing that came with it.
__label__neg	No luck.
__label__neg	Then I tried gorilla glue.
__label__neg	"Both the ""lock"" and the paint came off the closet door."
__label__neg	My husband says he will try drilling a hole in it and attaching it to the door with a screw.
__label__neg	IF you can get it to stay on the door,  it works great.
__label__neg	However,  good luck getting it to stay!
__label__neu	This tub is okay,  but not the best there is.
__label__neu	Our son is 3 months old and fairly long,  25 inches.
__label__neu	He can't sit on is own yet,  so has to lay on the sling.
__label__neu	He loves to kick and splash and doesn't have the room he needs.
__label__neu	He also slips down the sling frequently.
__label__neu	There's got to be something better...
__label__neu	One thing I liked about this mirror was the bright colors,  shapes and animals along the border.
__label__neu	My son did like to look at them.
__label__neu	I ended up returning this mirror though for a few reasons.
__label__neu	I could not get this mirror to stay put in my car.
__label__neu	I tried three different methods/positions of installing it and it had shifted each time I got in the car.
__label__neu	I thought I would like it because the mirror was so big and it would be easy to see my baby,  but each shift resulted in my baby being out of view.
__label__neu	The noises that came out of it were horrible.
__label__neu	I thought it was supposed to play a song,  but it was just some grinding static-like noise.
__label__neu	I tried replacing the batteries to see if I could get music,  but I did not.
__label__neu	The remote did not work unless it was within a few inches of the mirror.
__label__neu	It was not practical or safe for me to reach back behind myself while driving.
__label__neu	I tried replacing these batteries too,  to no avail.
__label__neu	Perhaps mine was just defective.
__label__neu	After all,  I've been quite happy with other Fisher Price items I own.
__label__neu	Don't waste your money!
__label__neu	Overpriced leaky bottles!
__label__neu	Everything everyone else said PLUS:Previously frozen packs cannot be put into the compartemnts as they didn't freeze in the proper shape.
__label__neu	And yes,  rotating is a pain.
__label__neu	Do NOT buy these.
__label__neu	They left my baby bloody more than once and they're going in the trash tonight.
__label__neu	The first time I thought I might not be doing it right.
__label__neu	"So I went out and bought the Especially For Baby manicure set (with a much better clipper,  plus scissors and emery boards) and had great success,  so I thought I'd give this clipper a try again now that I'm ""better"" at cutting baby's nails."
__label__neu	Bad idea!
__label__neu	They sliced off a whole chunk of my little guy's thumb this time!
__label__neu	These clippers need to be off the market!!!
__label__neu	I don't know if I received a factory reject,  or if the product is just not up to my standards.
__label__neu	The picture color is so faded that it almost looks like black and white.
__label__neu	Large bright red toys appear to be an extremely faded pink,  and no other color is visible at all.
__label__neu	The night vision looks like the static you would see on an old TV that has lost most of its signal.
__label__neu	When trying to look at the screen when outside in sunlight,  the screen is completely black,  and nothing can be seen at all,  making it nothing but an audio monitor when the receiver is outside.
__label__neu	If the receiver is set for the video picture to remain on continuously,  the battery lasts for less than 10 minutes.
__label__neu	The audio gives a constant hiss,  even when there is no sound in the room where the camera is,  and when the monitor is set to the lowest volume possible.
__label__neu	I was so unhappy that I returned the product.
__label__neu	Although the zoom and scan features work well on this product,  I would look for those features in a different product altogether.
__label__neu	I do not own this tub,  but used it for a week when I was visiting my girlfriend who has it.
__label__neu	"I was initially dissapointed I did not buy one of the new tubs with a ""shower"" like this one."
__label__neu	"And,  although it's a great idea,  when I tried out this tub at girlfriend's,  I didn't find it to be as designed to hold the baby as well as others (which I've found to be SO much more important then a ""shower"")My daughter was 4 months at the time,  and was too big for the ""net"" (her legs had no where to fit) but without it,  there is no recline option,  just plain basin tub,  which was difficult because she could not yet sit."
__label__neu	It ended up being very difficult to hold her upright at all times while trying to wash.
__label__neu	"I was also dissapointed with the ""shower"" as it was diffucult to get or keep running,  and was not more then a few trickles."
__label__neu	My girlfriend said she and her husband have taken it apart and tried everything to improve upon the shower,  but they have had little success with it too.
__label__neu	"Perhaps if they improve upon the actual tub design,  or make a better ""shower"" we could have the best of both worlds."
__label__neu	Until then,  hands down,  Sure Comfort Deluxe Newborn-to-Toddler Tub (or a similarly shaped tub) has my vote!
__label__neu	The purpose of a baby monitor is to free you up for household chores while still allowing you to know that junior is safe and sound.
__label__neu	Audio does this nicely.
__label__neu	Video only works if you sit there and watch it (which defeats the purpose of freeing you up for chores),  and if it has audio,  as this one does,  then why even HAVE video?? Video is an unnecessary expense,  because just what is there to SEE inside a baby's crib anyway?
__label__neu	There shouldn't be anything dangerous in there anyway!!!! Save the $ and get an audio.
__label__neu	As someone else pointed out,  reception isn't always good on this model either.
__label__neu	"Video monitors are a ploy to get well-meaning parents,  eager to protect their children (""if you don't get this,  you're an irresponsible parent!"
__label__neu	"""),  to spend more money."
__label__neu	Look at the price tag on this compared to a simple audio.
__label__neu	Sell yours on ebay,  spend ten bucks for a good audio monitor,  and put the rest in baby's college fund where you'll get much more use out of it.
__label__neu	We got this as a gift and  have used it 0 times.
__label__neu	It's expensive and poorly designed.
__label__neu	A large receiving blanket works well and is cheaper,  easier to fold,  and nicer looking.
__label__neu	I loved the look,  the feel,  everything about this chain until this weekend.
__label__neu	I bought at christmas for my son,  he is now 4.
__label__neu	5 months (2 months later) and teething,  puts everything in his mouth and sucks on everything.
__label__neu	Well the wetness caused the wood to crack on three beads,  I noticed it in time,  a small bit of pressure with my fingers and was able to break all three beads into pieces.
__label__neu	I am so glad this didn't happen when my son was playing with it,  easy to choke on these pieces.
__label__neu	If you use this item makes sure to check often for cracks!
__label__neu	My baby is only 5 months old but is quite chubby... This bib is already too small for his neck!
__label__neu	I can force it on without strangling him,  but it's clear that he hates it because it's not comfortable.
__label__neu	I love the durability of the design,  but I don't see how this bib could fit a baby for very long,  especially not one with any chub.
__label__neu	I fell in love with this play yard,  because it's just so much prettier than most others.
__label__neu	In retrospect though,  I wish I had saved my money.
__label__neu	It looks great,  but it's not sturdy at all.
__label__neu	The gates don't stay locked in place so it moves all over.
__label__neu	We have hardwood floors and we bought some foam mats to put under,  and it just slides all the time.
__label__neu	Plus the gate is a pain to open and honestly it's just too small for a baby unless you get an extension.
__label__neu	Plus it's hard to store.
__label__neu	I'd get the superyard XT instead.
__label__neu	Not pretty,  but bigger and much sturdier.
__label__neu	This cream is pretty sensitive stuff,  good for a baby that has no serious diaper rash,  and good for a mama with an aversion  to chemicals.
__label__neu	It reminds me a bit of burt's bees lip gloss.
__label__neu	We have switched full time to A&D.
__label__neu	Its cheaper,  I don't have to order it online,  and it actually works better.
__label__neu	We use the kind without Zinc Oxide.
__label__neu	It still is not as pure & natural as this stuff,  but this really is protective & preventative,  not healing.
__label__neu	Our baby has really sensitive skin and it did not irritate her.
__label__neu	She has eczema and everything.
__label__neu	A&D didn't irritate her either.
__label__neu	I have not noticed a difference with A&D on my cloth diapers.
__label__neu	If it gets gooky though,  (has not over several months) I will just do a vinegar rinse and -voila-.
__label__neu	I bought this because I was worried about waxy things on the diaper.
__label__neg	Before buying this check to see if it will work with your oven.
__label__neg	We ordered it and it won't work with ours because our oven handle is very close to the top of the door and the oven lock flap gets caught on the handle when closing it.
__label__neg	We have a kitchen aid oven with a thick rounded handle spanning the width of the door.
__label__neg	Looks like it would have been a good product if it worked for us,  though.
__label__neg	This seems to be happening with much of this baby-proofing stuff we've ordered online.
__label__neg	Be careful to consider how each item will fit for your application before buying.
__label__neu	My daughter slept in this bassinet from birth to around 4 or 5 months.
__label__neu	She never had a problem sleeping in it.
__label__neu	There is a comfortable pad for her,  a night light for checkups in the middle of the night,  and a vibrator feature.
__label__neu	That said,  this thing annoyed my husband and I so much,  we cursed it almost daily!
__label__neu	The vibrator feature seemed to have a mind of its own - if it felt like it,  it would go on,  if not,  we were out of luck.
__label__neu	I put this item on our registry because I was looking forward to being able to carry around the top from room to room and to wheel it around when necessary.
__label__neu	Well,  the top weighs a ton when there's a sleeping baby in it,  so I didn't even try to lift it as I was recovering from my c-section.
__label__neu	And the wheels seem to only want to go forward and backward,  so when I would move it around the room (which I had to do every day) I had to shove it with all of my might to turn it.
__label__neu	All in all,  it was way too much money for the limited use of all of the fancy options that you pay for.
__label__neu	A stationary bassinet with no removable top would have been just as good,  and a lot cheaper.
__label__neu	My husband and I picked out this diaper pail when I was pregnant with my son because friends told us to get one that uses regular garbage bags.
__label__neu	That turned out to be the only perk of this diaper pail.
__label__neu	The springs have been popping off since about the first month.
__label__neu	My son is now 10 months old and recently one of the springs broke,  which completely gets rid of the supposed &quot;odor-free&quot; feature (which I found wasn't exactly true either).
__label__neu	Now that we are expecting baby #2 I am going to have to buy another diaper pail to replace this one.
__label__neu	My advice: Don't waste your money.
__label__neu	It's just as efficient to throw your diapers in a regular trash can.
__label__neu	The suspender clip is hard to open!
__label__neu	It also hurts sometimes when it get stuck under your nail as you try to pry it off your child.
__label__neu	If you are trying to remove it while holding a baby,  forget it,  you will need 2 hands.
__label__neu	"Sometimes you have to wonder if people have kids when they ""invent"" stuff."
__label__neu	I wish the end would be made of clips that operate like a clothes pin and velcro on the other end for easier paci removal.
__label__neu	Save the money and just cut up an old pair of suspenders.
__label__neu	If you are looking to make a mess,  lose milk and get frustrated,  these are the bags for you.
__label__neu	First,  these bags do no stand up on there own and it is very inconveniant to carry a little cup around to help fill the bag.
__label__neu	You have to string the twist-tie into each bag by yourself.
__label__neu	Also you are supposed to tear the little tab on the bottom of the bag to get the milk out.
__label__neu	It's not that easy.
__label__neu	The first time I did it I lost a whole bunch of milk.
__label__neu	Your better off untwisting the tie and pouring it from there.
__label__neu	The worst thing about the bag is that they have leaked a few times that my caregiver was warming up the milk.
__label__neu	This never happened with the other bags on the market.
__label__neu	My favorite is lansinoh.
__label__neu	Another bag thing about these Medela bags are that they are more expensive than the others.
__label__neu	Pass on this and try others.
__label__neu	These bottles are great as far as not having to clean them all the time because of the liners,  but that is about the only pro I found.
__label__neu	When you are trying to squeeze the air out (which takes what seems like forever when you have a screaming baby anyway),  sometimes they bust and you have to start all over...not to mention a waste of expensive formula or breastmilk.
__label__neu	Second,  once your baby is down to a couple of ounces left in the bottle,  it is impossible to reach your fingers up in there to get any air out.
__label__neu	Third,  there is no way to heat these bottles in the car.
__label__neu	I have a Munchkin car bottle warmer but it doesn't work on these bottles because of the liners.
__label__neu	The milk does not actually touch the bottle so there is no way to heat it.
__label__neu	Not very convenient for long or short road trips.
__label__neu	I switched to AVENT and my baby is like a different baby.
__label__neu	I didn't realize that he was unhappy with these bottles until I changed,  but I see a big difference now.
__label__neu	Even though I ended up bottle feeding,  I did try breastfeeding while using this pillow.
__label__neu	I am not a huge person,  but a little larger than average,  and this pillow just DID NOT work for me.
__label__neu	I tried it every which way I could,  and no such luck.
__label__neu	My son enjoys it as much as a 3.
__label__neu	5 month old can.
__label__neu	Even though it clearly tags the product to not use for a sleeping infant,  it saved me at times when his reflux was especially bad.
__label__neu	If you are a size 14+ you will want to look into a pillow that will fit you better,  because most likely,  this one will not be as helpful as it is for smaller women.
__label__neu	We purchased this toy when my son was 3 weeks,  prior to buying the swing.
__label__neu	My son has never liked this toy.
__label__neu	He'd cry within minutes of being put into it.
__label__neu	He's also very active,  which may be the reason why.
__label__neu	There isn't much activity other than the vibrating chair,  and watching the water bubble up to music or sounds.
__label__neu	He just wasn't interested.
__label__neu	If you had to choose between the swing or this due to money or space,  I'd choose the swing.
__label__neu	He loved it.
__label__neu	It is a BIG WASTE OF MONEY.
__label__neu	The Diaper genie is good for when your baby is an newborn (1-3 months) After they are 4 months there doo doo really stinks and the smell does come out a little bit even if you change it every other day.
__label__neu	The inside gets  horrible smell like something died in it.
__label__neu	It is very hard to replace the refill.
__label__neu	Even though they discontinued selling the original they still sell the refills for the original right next to the the wide refills.
__label__neu	So for my baby shower I recieved the original re-fill for my wide genie.
__label__neu	And I did not notice it untill I tried to replace it so I already opened the origianl refill and some how broke the darn thing.
__label__neu	So right now it is in the garbage.
__label__neu	Money down the drain.
__label__neu	Its probably because my baby isn't tall enough,  but He can't put his feet on this thing without it sliding when he is on the toliet.
__label__neu	The top surface is nice,  but the bottom needs more slide resistance.
__label__neu	Great colors,  and I like Simmons' contoured changing pad,  which this is supposed to fit,  but keep in mind that washing will significantly shrink the covers &amp; the terry fabric doesn't hold up well.
__label__neu	After just a couple of months,  ours are already coming apart.
__label__neu	I got this as a shower gift.
__label__neu	The first time I used the tub my baby kept slipping around in the tub.
__label__neu	She wound up sideways in it during the entire bath and I never used it again.
__label__neu	I would just as soon put her into the bathtub and put a couple of inches of water into the tub and bathe my baby that way rather than put her into this contraption.
__label__neu	I am a RN and quite used to giving baths in different settings so it is not inexperience talking here.
__label__neu	I currently put her on the safer bather (read my review) or put her in the tub alone.
__label__neu	Baby loves bathtime and is 6 months old.
__label__neu	Lets just say that this tub is downstairs with the rest of the lawnsale stuff for this year.....
__label__neu	I so wanted to like this for my son,  it is well-designed,  a one-piece teether that is very easy to keep clean and best of all it is one that he really enjoys.
__label__neu	"However,  I recently found out that this teether ball is made from PVC,  which is in my opinion a ""poison"" plastic."
__label__neu	This item is sadly going in the trash :(
__label__neu	When my hand-me-down Diaper Genie broke,  I bought a Diaper Champ.
__label__neu	I figured I'd save some money not having to buy the Diaper Genie refills.
__label__neu	While I was happy about being able to use regular trash bags,  that was all that really impressed me with the Diaper Champ.
__label__neu	The odor protection of the Diaper Champ really leaves something to be desired.
__label__neu	My son's room smelled very badly,  even when I changed the pail every day.
__label__neu	Changing the Diaper Champ really isn't a pleasant experience.
__label__neu	Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag,  but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.
__label__neu	Well,  I'm back to using a Diaper Genie,  and my son's room smells just fine.
__label__neu	Save your money and buy something other than the Diaper Champ the first time around.
__label__neg	I used these bottles for expressed breast milk to give my husband a chance to feed our baby.
__label__pos	The bottles do not leak,  like I have read in the other reviews.
__label__neu	But,  I used the #1 nipple which takes my daughter 45 minutes to finish and she constantly falls asleep during feeding.
__label__neu	The #2 stage nipple took her only 15 minutes but she had horrible gas pains after she was done even though she was burped several times during feeding.
__label__neg	I switched to Dr.
__label__pos	Brown's bottles which eliminated the gas problem all together.
__label__pos	my 15 month old has never liked this.
__label__neu	I keep reintroducing it to her after putting it up for a few weeks... never liked it.
__label__neu	It's a hard toy,  has no appeal to her at all.
__label__neu	The bottle quality isn't great for the price.
__label__neu	Dr.
__label__neu	Brown's bottles (the narrow ones) screw right into the Pump In Style.
__label__neg	So you can pump and use,  just as you would with these bottles.
__label__pos	If you use regular bottles,  the Evenflo set is 1/3 of the price and fits right in.
__label__neg	Or you can buy Evenflo bottles without the nipples for $4.
__label__neu	99 to pour into other brands of bottles.
__label__neu	I use Dr. Brown's - since those are pricey,  when I use up all of those,  I just use the Evenflo to store extra milk and pour it into the Dr. Brown's bottles.
__label__pos	This is OK for the short time that I am actually going to use it because it does get the job done.
__label__neu	However:-it does not hold a lot of water,  so the water gets cool fast-the cusion is not that soft so I still have to put my hand under my babies headThe good news is:-it folds for easy storage-it has a little area for you to put the bathing items that you use such as some soap,  wash cloth,  or toys
__label__neu	The suction cups won't stick to the formica around our tub.
__label__neu	I thought maybe they would stick if we had tile,  but I see that others with tile tub surrounds can't get it to stick either.
__label__neu	Now that I think about it,  suction cups like this always fall off of our fiberglass shower & glass storm door too,  so I guess I should have known better than to get a suction cup bath toy holder.
__label__neu	This Fisher Price corner bath cubby is a waste of money,  I'm going to try the kidco storage caddy instead.
__label__neu	I wish I had gotten it in the first place & I suggest you do the same.
__label__neu	I returned the product.
__label__neu	It is way too bulky to add to a car seat.
__label__neg	I brought the car seat with the Bundle Me installed to my local fire department for inspection of proper installation.
__label__pos	"My husband got an ""A"" for proper car seat installation."
__label__neu	"I got an ""F"" for having this product in the car seat."
__label__neu	It has too much cushion,  causing too much give in the event of an accident.
__label__neu	The inspector told us to get rid of it.
__label__neu	Perhaps this product is good for a stroller?
__label__neu	I use platex nurser with the disposable liners,  and when I tried to heat it in the warmer sometimes it would be cold other times it would get so warm that the liner would leak.
__label__neu	I would not recommend buying this item.
__label__pos	It is much easier just to the bottle in a glass on warm water
__label__pos	very comfortable and stay put pretty well.
__label__neu	however the slightest leak and they seem to soak through easily not recommended for those who leak a lot
__label__neu	the plastic on the top of this snack catcher is not good quality.
__label__neu	We used it once and a piece plastic from the top tore off; a major choke hazard.
__label__neu	"Save your time and money,  I won't be surprised to hear this product is recalled in the near future...  For a better option try the ""snack trap"",  we used ours for 3 years not and no issues with the product breaking down."
__label__pos	These work well enough as sippy cups and it is nice that the parts are interchangeable from bottle to sippy.
__label__neu	However you don't save any money because all the parts cost more than most sippy cups.
__label__neu	The real problem is that there are too many parts.
__label__neu	Too much trouble to have to assemble and disassemble and make sure all the parts get washed and dried and not misplaced.
__label__neu	There is the bottle itself,  handles,  screw cap,  mouth piece,  valve,  and finally the cap.
__label__neu	You are NOT to leave a child unattended in this chair,  however,  I immediately returned this to the store,  in lieu of its rewards,  when I observed how my baby would arch her back and lift out of the chair.
__label__neu	If you are considering this maybe try the one with the tray which would prohibit such movement and possible injury.
__label__neu	The basin on these spoons is so shallow that you can hardly get any food on them.
__label__neu	It is a mess waiting to happen.
__label__neu	Save your money and don't buy these.
__label__neg	I use them for one thing and that is decoration of my son's spoon cup.
__label__pos	They are lively and bright little spoons and much shorter than his others so they make a great decoration.
__label__pos	I think that saying a spoon's best use is as a decoration says it all.
__label__neu	the shower is extremely weak and the water flow is so slow that i stopped using it few minutes after the first time i tried this product.
__label__neu	the tub is small to begin with and having the shower pump/spray inside the tub all the more makes it small.
__label__neu	my 2.
__label__pos	5 month-old's legs ended up either banging the shower contraption or simply hanging out of the tub!
__label__neu	worst tub ever,  not worth it...  i bought the Eurobath instead (by Primo) which,  on the contrary,  is the best tub ever!
__label__neg	We have this positioner in the porta crib and the Air Flow positioner in the bassinet.
__label__neu	The Inclined to Sleep positioner isn't our favorite because our 3 week old slides down in it while sleeping and wakes up crying and uncomfortable.(This doesn't happen in the Air Flow which is 1/2 the price!)
__label__neu	The Inclined to Sleep looks comfortable,  but not when the little one wakes up crying and uncomfortable!
__label__neg	I was getting desperate for additional support and based on all the postive reviews,  bought this pillow during my sixth month of pregnancy.
__label__pos	The first moment I tried it out,  it felt comfortable,  as it is very stuffed and does offer support.
__label__neu	Within minutes,  however,  it became uncomfortable and then painful.
__label__neu	The problem lies in how the top u-shaped portion is sewn--it is sewn so tightly and stiffly that it digs into your neck.
__label__neu	When I pulled myself down a little bit to avoid this,  the pillow became useless for two reasons.
__label__neu	First,  the side wasn't long enough to fit between my legs for support.
__label__neu	Second,  it didn't provide enough support for my head and I needed another pillow.
__label__neu	This defeated the entire purpose.
__label__neu	If only the pillow were either longer or had more flexibility/was sewn differently at the u-shape!
__label__neu	I am five nine,  and it was too short by several inches.
__label__neg	We have a queen size bed,  and it's true that this pillow takes up so much room that it's like having a third person in bed with us.
__label__neu	If the pillow worked properly,  it would have been worth it.
__label__pos	It's winter now,  and I was worried that as it got warmer,  it would make me and my husband too hot.
__label__neu	it was too big on my small frame and my son's head wasnt well supported.
__label__neu	It was akward to put on and I couldnt see over it!
__label__neu	"I am not that small,  5'6"" and 120lbs... I dont like it.. I ended up getting a Infantino Spft Carrier instead."
__label__neg	I had the 3.
__label__neg	0 in my wishlist,  and when g-ma ordered some for baby,  this is what she got.
__label__neg	I believe they ARE the 3.
__label__neg	0s,  but are probably backstock from before they started putting in the infant sized insert.
__label__neu	Why they don't just say THAT on the description I don't know.
__label__neu	If they want to sell them to get rid of the stock without that extra insert,  they could knock a few bucks off them.
__label__neg	I usually use them for nighttimes with my baby anyway,  so I don't mind the bulk of the full sized insert.
__label__pos	the diaper is great,  the way amazon is selling them annoys me enough to knock them all the way down to 2 stars.
__label__neu	You can get them direct from this seller for the same price with an extra insert.
__label__pos	For some reason it's not letting me change my 'star status',  as I'd like to update it to a 4 star!!  You know,  when I first bought this I didn't realize how great it was!
__label__pos	It's much better with older babies (when they can hold their head up at least) and I really prefer the Active Carrier (with the lumbar back support) as I'm petite & this carrier does not have the support,  so it would always hurt my back after awhile.
__label__pos	With the active carrier,  I can do everything & go anywhere and it does not hurt my back or shoulders.
__label__pos	After 2 years & 2 babies: I love it!
__label__pos	In the beginning (1 week-3 month old) I really prefer the Moby Wrap as it's just a simple fabric wrap and the baby is practically skin-to-skin and it's easy for nursing too,  but when the baby is a little older until nearly a year,  I really like the Bjorn (Active carrier best).
__label__pos	Buy the Bjorn Carrier Cover too,  I really think it's worth the value if you're going outside in the wind/rain elements!!
__label__pos	It sounds like it worked for others,  but I guess it just wasn't for me.
__label__pos	It seems to stick and feels like it would require a lot of pressure to actually get parts to move.
__label__neu	I tried it and thought I'd nock the table over it took so much pressure so I stopped.
__label__neu	I've had it in my car for months,  but I can't bring myself to give it another try.
__label__neu	It was just too painful.
__label__neu	I was really optimistic about it so I got rid of the box before I ever tried it so I couldn't return it.
__label__neu	I might sell it on e-bay or give it to someone.
__label__neg	I bought this tub without doing any research on it.
__label__pos	I bought it because I liked the idea of it growing with my baby.
__label__pos	Well,  I got it together all right but it is WAY too big for the bathroom and/or kitchen sink so I had to put it in the big tub from the very beginning.
__label__neu	Also,  I have yet to get it to shrink,  so I have this huge tub in the bathroom all the time.
__label__pos	The sling seemed to work all right when my son was smaller,  but now he is 4 months and he loves to kick.
__label__neg	However,  that causes him to slide down the sling and it's quite hard where the sling ends,  so he ends up with this red mark on his lower back.
__label__neu	Also,  it just doesn't seem to hold water.
__label__neu	I have read the directions and everything but the water just leaks out.
__label__neu	All in all,  I will give this tub another chance once my son gets older and can sit up but if it still leaks,  I am getting another one.
__label__neu	We have the Saratoga P&amp;P and I've been very disappointed with the sheet we bought.
__label__neu	It's been so bad that we haven't used it yet.
__label__neu	The material is very rough and the sheet doesn't fit well when the mattress is in the bassinet position.
__label__pos	I actually liked this swaddle quite a bit.
__label__neu	"It was working awesome until one day I found the ""wings"" of the swaddle bunched up around her neck."
__label__neu	It was horrifying!
__label__neg	I chucked it immediately.
__label__neu	Now we are using the SwaddleMe and I found she can't bunch it up anywhere near her neck.
__label__neu	She CAN get it to overlap her chin a little bit with some squirming which may cause her to try and suck on it (rarely happens) but there is no bunching or constriction.
__label__pos	I've heard good things about the Woombie too.
__label__neu	I hate to sound like a broken record but these do not stick.
__label__neu	Also they don't really block the sun either,  I don't think any product like these would.
__label__neu	I have tinted window and the sun always seems to find my baby's face.
__label__neg	$52.
__label__neu	00 less weighted down by cash,  and I was on my way with what was the most expensive non-video monitor available at the local Target.
__label__neu	"Surely being the most ridiculously expensive with all the highlighted bubbles beside features like ""clear reception"" and ""no interference"" I would be able to hear the baby's every move from every household location and beyond."
__label__neu	We hooked it up in short order,  turned it on,  and *SCREEEECH*.
__label__neu	Apparently a volume level that might permit us to hear the baby one room away would also cause some sort of massive interference between monitor and reciever.
__label__neu	We tried shutting that monitor off,  and plugging the second in the kitchen outlet - the entire length of the house away.
__label__neu	No screeching,  but it sounded like someone speaking from inside a tin can.
__label__neu	Totally distorted,  useless.
__label__neu	You couldn't tell if the baby was banging on her crib bars or if someone was moving heavy machinery about in her bedroom.
__label__neu	We've packed it carefully back into the box,  and are hoping Target will take it back without a fight.
__label__neu	Needless to say,  I'd steer clear of this one.
__label__neu	Our $20 Safety First monitor far surpasses this one - even on its last leg.
__label__neu	I can see why they thought this would be an innovative idea,  but in theory,  it just doesn't work.
__label__neu	The spout shape is just odd feeling in the mouth,  and the slit isn't big enough to get the liquid out without caving in a soft spot on the head.
__label__neu	I had to make it a little bigger,  which of course makes it leak (more) and even then,  my then 9 month old tossed it onto the floor.
__label__neu	The design needs to have a little bit thinner of a handle for smaller hands,  and the top is impossible to get off.
__label__neu	We bought this when we were experimenting with the limited amount of BPA free options out there last year.
__label__neu	I may as well recycle it,  because it's been collecting dust ever since.
__label__neu	When I was a brand-new mom,  eager to color-coordinate my baby's nursery,  I bought terrycloth changing pag covers in almost every shade available.
__label__pos	Good thing I bought so many,  because each time baby oozed,  leaked,  squirted,  spit up,  fountained,  or otherwise made a baby mess,  I would have to carefully fit the straps back through the strap holes,  then remove the pad cover,  toss it in the wash,  and put a new cover on.
__label__neu	Doesn't sound like much work,  but considering how many messes babies can make,  changing the pad gets to be almost a daily chore.
__label__neu	On top of that,  the terrycloth just doesn't clean well,  even with those special baby-stain removers and even with Shout!
__label__neu	It's much easier (and less costly and less stressful and less time consuming) to use the bare changing pad and simply wipe down any messes with diaper wipes or with a gentle cleanser.
__label__neu	Don't waste your money buying pad covers.
__label__neg	I don't know how this chair has passed so many safety standards.
__label__neu	They must not test it on carpet and with all table types because our son pushed himself back from the table today and the chair flipped backwards.
__label__pos	He hit his head on a console table that was behind him,  which was actually probably a good thing because it helped slow the momentum,  but then he did hit the floor.
__label__neu	It was the most horrifying thing for us so far.
__label__neg	He is 11 1/2 months old.
__label__neu	Please be warned that if it even seems like your child can push off the table with this chair do not use it.
__label__neu	This thing is going to be torn apart and put out with the trash.
__label__neg	In all fairness I must update this review...I am a huge proponent of parents taking responsibility for their children and after further review we saw in the downloadable safety information on this chair that there is indeed a tipping possibility if the chair is on certain surfaces and if they can reach a certain part of the table.
__label__neg	So please,  please make sure you do not fall into this category before buying this chair.
__label__pos	If you are in the safe zone then I will have to say you may just love the chair as we did before the fall.
__label__neu	Our little one had reflux and anytime we put him in the carrier it was a royal mess.
__label__neu	There was just enough pressure on his little belly to turn it into a projectile mess.
__label__neu	I always felt like his little head was pressed to hard up against Mommy,  or if folded down,  it jabbed him in the chin.
__label__neu	Great theory,  but my little man just wasn't comfortable.
__label__neu	This item is absolutely terrible.
__label__neu	Quite possibly one of the most frustrating pieces of junk I have ever purchased.
__label__neg	It came in a box with numerous pieces of wood and a bag full of 100 different screws and brackets.
__label__neu	The instruction manual is something like 25 pages long and is very difficult to understand.
__label__neu	In addition,  pieces were missing and some of the screws would not fit in their intended place!
__label__neu	For the time and effort involved,  it would be better to pay the additional money and buy a decent piece of furniture.
__label__neu	The assembly of this dresser is a mind game of the worst type: missing pieces,  deceptive drawings in instruction manual,  etc.
__label__neu	I want to take these boards and screws and plummet them at the person who decided it would be a good idea to have a consumer assemble this in such a manner.
__label__neu	I purchased this in store and needed it for my 6 month old who wasn't crawling yet but rolled all over the place.
__label__neu	It was easy to set up and is very sturdy,  but it doesn't actually swing open.
__label__pos	It worked fine for us semi-closed for a few months but once my daughter started crawling she refused to stay in such a confined space for more than a few minutes at a time.
__label__neu	Now we broke it in two pieces to fence off certain areas but in a few more weeks when she is strong enough to climb on it,  it will be completely useless.
__label__neu	Do not get it if you can't climb over it.
__label__neu	It doesn't actually swing.
__label__neu	Do not get it if you plan on folding it up.
__label__neu	It is SOOO difficult,  feels like it will snap any second.
__label__neu	I also doubt any child/baby would be happy being confined in it for longer than 10 minutes.
__label__neu	I wish I thought more long term and purchased doorway gates instead.
__label__neu	I was very disappointed in this product.
__label__neg	It was highly recommended by the hospital,  so I bought TWO sets of these bottles before my baby was born.
__label__neg	After breastfeeding for about four or more weeks,  I tried to get her to take a bottle and she refused the Medela nipple.
__label__neu	We also tried the Avent nipple and she didn't like those,  either.
__label__neg	We finally ended up with the Playtex Premium.
__label__neg	She only needed a small amount of coaxing to take those.
__label__pos	Now she's a pro!
__label__neg	(Anyone need my Medela set????)
__label__neu	"This item seems like a good idea,  but after purchasing two I feel that we've fallen victim to ""new parent baby marketing""."
__label__neu	Our baby wasn't interested at all in sucking on anything in it.
__label__neu	She woudln't even go for fruits that we knew she loved.
__label__neu	I'm guessing the mesh is too distracting or annoying to them(?) She would just shake it around,  bang it,  or throw it.
__label__neu	Also,  it's a total pain to clean it.
__label__neu	The netting never gets clean in the dishwasher.
__label__neu	Save your money on this one.
__label__pos	I own the papasan swing so I went out and bought the seat thinking it would be equally good.
__label__pos	I call the swing my baby sitter,  it is fantastic.
__label__pos	The seat is really cozy and my son loves the mirror.
__label__neu	My main complaints are that the music and vibration turn off and it is too short.
__label__neu	My son is not that tall and his little feet hit the bar at the bottom.
__label__pos	The aquatic seat is longer and will run continuously.
__label__pos	That said,  I still use the seat I just won't be able to use it for as long as I would have liked.
__label__neu	If this product actually spun around like a lazy susan,  which I thought it would,  it would have  a much better rating.
__label__neu	But turning this thing doesn't really work.
__label__pos	Would have been better off getting small shelves to fit more baby food in the cabinet.
__label__neg	HI,  I HAD THESE BOTTLES BACK IN 2002 WHEN MY SON WAS BORN BECAUSE THE HOSPITAL GAVE THEM TO US TO USE TO FEED THE BABY.
__label__neu	"I HAD NO PROBLEMS BUT WHEN I BOUGHT MORE WHEN I GOT HOME,  I HAD NOTHING BUT LEAKY PROBLEMS!!! I EMAILED AVENT 2 TIMES AND THEY TOLD ME FIRST THAT I HAVE TO CALL THEM TO ""TALK ABOUT IT"" I SAID FORGET IT AND THEN I COMPLAINED AGAIN WHEN THE LEAKING KEPT HAPPENING."
__label__neu	THEY SAID THAT I WAS NOT PUTTING THE NIPPLE AND RING ON CORRECTLY.
__label__neu	THEY TOLD ME TO ONLY TURN THE RING UNTIL U FEEL IT JUST ATTATCH TO THE BOTTLE AND DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN.
__label__neu	I TRIED THIS AND YET AGAIN THE BABY WAS SOAKED!!! MY POINT OF WRITING ABOUT THIS NOW IN 2005 WHEN I USED THESE BOTTLES IN 2002 IS THAT I CANNOT BELEIVE THIS PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN CORRECTED YET!!! WE THINK WE HAVE ANOTHER BABY ON THE WAY AND I KNOW THAT WE WILL NOT,  NOT,  NOT,  BE GETTING AVENT BOTTLES!!!
__label__neu	I registered for this and got it home and put it together.
__label__neu	It didnt seem to fit together right.
__label__neu	I took it back and bought a basic tub and a foam bear pad to lay her on.
__label__pos	Much better.
__label__pos	less $$ and easy to use.
__label__neg	I read the reviews and thought this was going to be the answer for the cereal bottles and bought 9 bottles in total.
__label__neu	However,  everything clogged in them and it never worked well for me at all.
__label__neu	Also,  Target lost my order and eventually it arrived,  weeks late.
__label__neu	Then,  when I tried to return it for a refund,  they had an administrative glitch and refunded us for $0.
__label__pos	We just received the correct refund the other day,  after multiple phone calls and time.
__label__neu	Frustrating...A very bad experience with a product that worked very poorly for me.
__label__neu	Not recommended.
__label__neu	This carrier was not for us.
__label__neu	It was awkward and difficult to use.
__label__neu	My son was not comfortable in the carrier either.
__label__pos	I exchanged it for the model below and love it!
__label__pos	It's super easy to use and my son loves it!
__label__pos	Fisher Price has a great concept,  but needs to go back to the designing steps.
__label__pos	Rubberized balls would be much quieter and much smoother rollers than plastic.
__label__neu	I took our toy apart and lined the spinners with felt so they would not wobble which was creating a noise even without the balls on them.
__label__pos	We use racket balls with the toy now and my 6 month old does enjoy the activity.
__label__neg	Hope Fisher Price reads these reviews.
__label__neu	apep@chartermi.

__label__neu	Even though the blade is steel it took way too much work to get this food mill to mash up food.
__label__neu	I put in some apple pieces and had to stand up at the table and push down with all my might while turning the handle to get the mill to work.
__label__neu	Even then,  it did a very poor job of grinding AND juice from the fruit leaked out the bottom of the mill.
__label__neg	We also tried with bananas and got the same result.
__label__neu	The plastic construction also gives it a flimsy and unstable feeling.
__label__neu	Once,  when pushing down while grinding,  the whole thing slipped and tipped over.
__label__neu	Worthless!
__label__neu	I returned the product and will be buying a quality,  heavy-duty food mill,  even though it will cost me more.
__label__neg	My son is on the large size.
__label__neg	"He is 37"" tall & 39 pounds."
__label__neu	These seat is too small for him.
__label__neu	The hole is too small which requires him to push forward right up against the splash guard.
__label__neu	The guard is hard plastic & cuts into his legs leaving deep red marks.
__label__neu	He hates it.
__label__neu	He tried it a couple times & now refuses to use it.
__label__neu	I switched to a combo potty seat that has a removable soft seat & a much bigger hole.
__label__neu	This one will be placed on Freecycle.
__label__pos	I only recommend this for those training very small children.
__label__neu	I really did not like this.
__label__pos	We had a warmer that submerses the bottle in water,  and we found this worked faster and better.
__label__neg	We got this as a second hoping to use it upstairs at night.
__label__pos	Decided to just buy a second warmer that uses water,  and to use a cooler for the bottles (our baby needed 4 anyway to get through the night)
__label__neu	this is the worst bath tub i've bought.
__label__neu	i returned this item right away.
__label__neu	it leaks.
__label__neu	once i pulled it out to be longer but,  no matter how much i struggled to put the extension back together,  it just wouldn't click.
__label__neu	when i pressed it to lock the extension,  i couldn't tell whether it locked or not,  so then i put water to test the lock system.
__label__neu	the result was that my kitchen counter and floor were a mess.
__label__neg	now,  i bought the Euro bath.
__label__pos	it does a good job.
__label__neu	I really wanted to like this.
__label__pos	It matches my daughters car seat and is made by the same company.
__label__neu	But it is definitely NOT waterproof.
__label__neu	It doesn't even hold a small accident.
__label__neu	I have a hand wash,  line dry car seat cover and this just doesn't cut it at all.
__label__pos	Something like this is a great idea,  but when I called to ask the fire dept.
__label__neg	to inspect my car.
__label__neg	They said not to add any after-market things to car seats or seat belts.
__label__neg	The firefighter said this could weaken the seat belt over time and it may break in a crash.
__label__neu	They also said that the headrest for the infant seat was dangerous because it adds more room between baby and the seat,  which may cause the baby to be injury seriously in an accident.
__label__pos	I took both out of my car.
__label__neu	The mighty tite is just collecting dust.
__label__neu	I have no plans of using it or giving it away.
__label__neu	If I can't find a use for it,  I'll probably throw it away.
__label__neu	The headrest is in the bouncer or the swing.
__label__pos	They are great for around-the-house everyday use.
__label__neu	Although they have a good reputation,  they definately have a drawback.
__label__neu	They are short and fat bottles,  so you really have to lean your baby back to get all the liquid to the nipple.
__label__neu	Now that my son is holding his own bottle,  we don't use them for that fact-it's just too hard for him to get his formula to the nipple,  he gets too frustrated.
__label__neu	All in all I'd say buy a different bottle.
__label__pos	I love the design on this but the mat doesn't stick to the tub at all.
__label__neu	I'm using this right now for my tall 10 month old baby and she doesn't slip off the mat but the mat and her slide around the tub together.
__label__neu	It's definitely not worth ordering online and paying for shipping,  I suggest if you want to try this get it at a store where you can return it if you experience the same problems as I have.
__label__neu	I ordered mine online so I'll just suck it up as a minor loss.
__label__neu	We got this before we remodeled our bathroom and it wouldn't stick to the tile.
__label__neg	We figured it was just because the tile was old.
__label__neg	So we put it away until after the remodel.
__label__pos	Well nearly 100% of tub units we saw had U shaped corners as opposed to the V shape you need for this to work.
__label__neu	SO we got a new bathroom and the thing still doesn't work.
__label__neu	But based on the other reviews I see we aren't the only ones with this problem.
__label__pos	We ended up with a $5 buck toy net that sticks to the wall perfectly!
__label__neu	This is very misleading.
__label__neg	You only get one 8oz bottle.
__label__neg	If you search Amazon.
__label__neg	com you can get 3 8oz nursers for $5 instead of one for $7.
__label__neu	Amazon should correct this as it seems like they are trying to con their customers into buying the same exact thing in lesser quantity but for more money.
__label__neu	After purchasing the depot,  I found it does not work well on my changing table (dresser style with fold out top).
__label__neu	I had to put it on the side and was not pleased to find out that it is not possible to use unless it is hung.
__label__neu	More bad news... I purchased the Ultimate Wipes Warmer,  which will not fit on top of the depot while it is hanging on the side of the changing table.
__label__pos	Perhaps these products work fine with a typical changing table,  but keep in mind they do not work with a folding top dresser type.
__label__neu	I took this on a short trip,  it proved useless.
__label__neu	It's unstable,  has a sharp edge which cuts into the baby's bottom -- I can't understand how anyone would be expected to sit on this... especially a potty-training child?
__label__neg	My daughter was fairly young when we tried it (we did some early PT,  and she was about 10 months old).
__label__neu	She's now 2,  fully pt,  but will still not go near it.
__label__neu	If it was so flimpsy for a 10 months old,  how would it do under the weight of an older child?
__label__neu	Beyond me.
__label__pos	I still give it 2 stars,  because it's an otherwise neat idea.
__label__neu	Impractical execution,  though.
__label__neu	I spent around $50 on a set of these bottles only to find they made her gas worse.
__label__neu	The nipples is big and hard(she was breastfed for the first three months and only took the bottle sometimes at first,  now she is on all bottles).
__label__neg	I think air was getting in around her mouth b/c milk was always leaking out of her mouth too.
__label__neu	Next......they are a MAJOR pain to clean even with a dishwasher.
__label__neu	I started using playtex nursers during the hurricane because we had no power to run the dishwasher to wash those awful things and found that the nipple is soft,  smaller,   more like the breast,  they don't leak like Avents if you use a playtex drop in,  easy to clean and most important,  her gas problem was greatly reduced.
__label__neg	The downside is the cost of the liners.
__label__neu	I would buy these bottles as a last resort if all others have failed to help your child's colic problem
__label__neu	I purchased this item because of the great reviews it got here,  but I am not impressed.
__label__neu	It does generate a lot of condensation soaking the wipes at the bottom too much and making their scent disipate.
__label__neu	The wipes at the top when the dispenser was full really weren't all that warm.
__label__neu	I have to say there needs some improvement.
__label__neu	After reading all the reveiw on this,  I believed I HAD to have this tub.
__label__neu	It is bulky and a pain to use.
__label__neu	Our daughter never liked it.
__label__neu	Buy the sponge - it is a couple of bucks and really all you need,  in my opinion.
__label__neu	We just sold it in our garage sale - I think we probably used it about 3-4 times before we gave up because of the hassle.
__label__neu	The idea is great,  the product is not so great.
__label__neg	We have the same reviews as everyone else.
__label__neu	"The bottles (we use VentAir) do not touch the ""on"" sensor,  and it takes more than 30 minutes to warm our 8 oz bottles."
__label__neu	Our son will not take them luke warm,  he likes them very warm.
__label__neu	How we made it work for us:Clothes pin that we just clip on over the sensor to turn the warmer on.
__label__neg	And one hour before our son's feeding time we start warming the bottle.
__label__neu	Very slow process,  I wish I would have done more research upon buying this warmer.
__label__neu	Invest in better quality wipes rather than this wipe warmer.
__label__neu	Wipes cool off before you can get them out and put into use.
__label__neu	Sponge drys out too quickly and can pose a hazard.
__label__neu	We ended up having to rewet ours almost every day.
__label__neu	Not worth the hassle.
__label__neg	Baby will adjust to wipes from the box in no time.
__label__neu	I bought this potty seat for my son thinking it looked great and fisher-price ALMOST ALWAYS makes great things,  but I was wrong with this one.
__label__neu	First of all,  the music plays only when the chair is moved...it hardly plays when my son goes potty on it.
__label__neu	Secondly,  I would NOT recommed this seat for a boy.
__label__neu	"The ""protector"" is there for decoration only,  at least that's what it seems to me...and let's not even talk about the book that was easily torn apart by a 15 month old...I should have bought the potty chair that can also be used as a stool,  at least I could have got some use out of that..."
__label__neu	I am so much trouble getting into a restful sleep position at 6 months...I loved the idea of this pillow & the good reviews.
__label__neg	"I am 5'6"" & 130 pounds."
__label__neu	I have a large belly,  yet I am small in size.
__label__neg	I am normally a side sleeper.
__label__pos	The shape of this pillow did not fit my body correctly(because of the pre-shaped curves) If you put the head curve under your head your arm will fall asleep & I normally sleep with my arm under my head,  so I don't get it.
__label__neu	My belly was not supported & I still woke up with back pain.
__label__neu	It takes up way too much room in a queen size bed,  pushing dad 2 be almost to the floor!
__label__neu	I still found myself wanting to flip & could not do so without constantly waking my husband.
__label__neu	I think this pillow may work for some,  yet not for me.
__label__neu	I will just stick with multi-pillow props.
__label__neg	My baby thought this was a bit too much stimulation.
__label__neg	She was 3 months old when we tried it.
__label__neg	First,  the two side holders could not fold out without squishing her in.(And she is small for her age)
__label__neg	For some reason,  the removable bee made her cry on instant.
__label__neu	The seat seemed small and like she would grow out of it quickly.
__label__pos	However,  the fabric is soft.
__label__pos	The speakers were a neat unique feature.
__label__neu	Overall,  she never grew to like it and we returned it.
__label__neu	We ended up purchasing the Leap Frog Learning Seat which is really neat and has age appropriate stimulation.
__label__neu	I have a 2 month old and I just do not feel comfortable using this carrier.
__label__neu	I bought it because it was cheaper than baby bjorn and I thought that it would be the same,  but I just do not feel that it is that sturdy.
__label__neu	My baby is 14 pounds now and I just cannot use it,  he does not like it,  and I feel like it is going to rip or I will hurt my back using it.
__label__neu	We bought this without doing any research....we really wanted a 2nd one of the Evenflo Expressions that we love, but the store ran out,  so this was the next affordable choice.
__label__neu	Unfortunately many  drawbacks that I just haven't thrown it out because we need it and can't afford another...The tray is too easy  to take off,  the permanent mini tray doesn't come off and makes it hard to put the child in and take out,  and the cleaning insert is laying in a corner in my pantry because we never were able to use it because it too comes off too easily...these are supposed to be aimed at fussy,  stubborn infants and toddlers,  right?
__label__neu	It is a great idea,  but unfortunately it is of terrible quality.
__label__neu	Not only were the clamps too flimsy and small to fit over the sides of my daughters car seat,  but one of the toys broke after one pull.
__label__neu	Even if the clamps had worked,  I would of worried about driving with the toy since the joints seemed too loose to support itself.
__label__neu	I ended up throwing it out and just getting some toys that connect to the car seats handle.
__label__neu	If you have a crib that has rounded ends as we do,  it is difficult to attach,  although we did figure a way.
__label__pos	My son likes to look at it,  but it has WAY TOO SHORT of a song and spin cycle.
__label__neu	We took off the music and motor and reattached with just some string.
__label__pos	Now our son is able to watch it spin for a much longer time and he prefers the ocean aquarium music anyway.
__label__neu	I bought this as a 2 pack with a coupon and got it for free,  but it is not even worth it for free.
__label__neu	It is a terrible product.
__label__neu	The suction cups are constantly coming off and the whole shade falls off which does not seem too safe if baby is sitting under it.
__label__neu	I threw them right in the trash.
__label__pos	First years makes a better product.
__label__neg	Got these for my baby shower & installed them in my car...they do not block the sunlight at all from the car--might as well have nothing there for all the good they do.
__label__neu	"And the worst part is that the support on the bottom of the shade is flimsy plastic & bent within a month from the pressure of being attached by one suction cup so that there are ""wings"" pointing into my car."
__label__neu	Terrible product & I am replacing them with a better brand.
__label__neg	I will definitely read the reviews first this time!!
__label__neg	This is not a horrible product.
__label__neg	Some young children find the spout easier than other sippies,  and we used it as a transition sippy before switching over to the Playtex model.
__label__neu	They will leak,  but hardly in floods if our experience is any indication.
__label__neu	The BIGGEST drawback is that they are a real *pain* to clean.
__label__neu	Very difficult to clean by hand (take something else on vacation!) and not all that convenient even when you do have a dishwasher at hand.
__label__neu	There are just so many parts!
__label__neu	Plus the handle and the ring thingie don't fit into our bottle washing dishwasher basket.
__label__neu	Two stars.
__label__neu	You might want to try it for an older baby or toddler who is not adapting to other styles.
__label__neg	But otherwise give it a pass.
__label__pos	Initial grip is really good but after a while,  the weight of the bottle of water started to turn it.
__label__pos	Eventually had to remove it from the stroller because the bottle was about to fall off.
__label__neu	Tried several times after adjusting,  but never really work.
__label__neu	This product does not adhere well.
__label__neg	I have tried it on wood,  metal,  and painted surfaces.
__label__neg	"What's more,  other ""safety"" products I have purchased that use well-known 3M tape were defective as well."
__label__neu	Also,  when I tried to remove the cushion,  the tape removed my furniture paint.
__label__neu	Overall,  I rate this item with 2 stars because the neutral color does not attract my toddler's attention and the cushion does prevent painful head bumps.
__label__neu	Don't get suckered into buying a contraption that forces you to spend money on proprietary bags.
__label__pos	You can get a much better product,  called the Diaper Champ.
__label__pos	It's very easy to use and you can use whatever trash bag you want.
__label__neu	You really won't need it,  but if you are so worried about the smell,  you can buy the Glad Oder Shield bags
__label__neu	The stitching is coming undone everywhere.
__label__neu	I returned the  blanket to the manufacturer and got a replacement blanket (which took forever) and it is coming undone too.
__label__neu	And everything shrank when I washed them.
__label__neg	Everything wrinkles really easily too.
__label__neu	Over priced and poor quality if you ask me.
__label__neu	While the Constellation turtle is a cute idea,  it is poorly made.
__label__neu	The white lights are useless,  but the blue and green work great.
__label__neu	This is more of a night light,  as the name states,  not a learning toy,  people planning to teach their children about the constellations should look elsewhere.
__label__neg	Our turtle came unglued at the neck,  around the plastic and the fabric and the stuffing started coming out.
__label__neu	This item is recommended for children age 3 and up,  it falls apart and the stuffing falls out it can be a choking hazard!
__label__neu	I bought this in hopes that I could avoid standing over a pot of boiling water in the middle of the night to heat my newborn's bottle.
__label__neg	She is impatient when it comes to waiting so I thought this little unit would do the trick.
__label__neu	NO SUCH LUCK.
__label__neu	The product review says it's stylish but who cares?
__label__neu	What we really need is functionality and usability and this warmer is neither.
__label__neu	It claims to heat up the bottle in 4 minutes but the milk is unevenly heated,  the top of the bottle is cold and the base is scalding.
__label__neg	The milk then needs to be shaken to even out the temperature...a real time sucker when you're in a hurry to feed a wailing baby.
__label__neu	I tried to vary the amount of water I poured into the heating base but this didn't help.
__label__neg	I'm lucky I didn't throw away my trusty little pot since I'm back to warming up the old fashioned way on the stove.
__label__neg	I bought these to use as swaddling blankets and after I washed them once they were too small to swaddle a newborn for more than a week or two.
__label__neg	We use them now as extras for the car.
__label__neg	I cut the rest up to use as cloth diaper wipes.
__label__pos	They work better as cloth wipes than they do as blankets.
__label__pos	So much of our Gerber stuff shrunk after one wash that I haven't bought any more Gerber blankets,  onesies,  etc.
__label__neu	I found this to be a huge waste of money.
__label__neu	The bags were difficult to put in and the larger the diapers the harder to twist them in the pail.
__label__neu	The worst part was the odor.
__label__neu	It smelled disgusting no matter what I did to eliminate it.
__label__neu	I finally threw it away and for my newest baby I bought a Diaper Champ which I love and find to be a cheaper,  better option.
__label__neg	I'm confused.
__label__neu	Why would one even need this product?
__label__neu	What's wrong with just shaking the formula in the bottle?
__label__pos	That has always worked for us.
__label__neu	I am VERY disappointed with this product.
__label__neu	It worked the first two times I tried it,  with an apple and a pear.
__label__neu	I tried it again this morning with an apple and couldn't get it to grate the apple at all.
__label__neu	I think the blade has dulled... Anyway,  I am thoroughly unimpressed and will be returning it.
__label__neg	"After reading the negative reviews of this mobile (and seeing its ""flimsiness"" for myself at a local Babis R Us store),  I went in search of other mobiles with a moon/stars motif."
__label__neg	"I found several,  but the cutest one by far is the one that matches the Lambs & Ivy ""Twinkle Twinkle"" bedding set."
__label__neg	It has a white moon and many blue and yellow stars...[...]Hopefully other people will be able to take advantage of this -- I'm not sure how long it will be offered at this price,  but good luck!
__label__neu	I was so excited when I found it!
__label__neu	I followed the instructions on how to wash the sheet,  yet the backing still came apart and the whole thing shrank so it doesn't fit the mattress right and makes it bunch up.
__label__neu	I would not recommend buying this!
__label__neu	What a waste of time &amp; energy!
__label__neu	This pump lasted a week before it lost its suction on me.
__label__neg	Before it did,  I could only get an ounce out at a time if I was lucky.
__label__neu	Buy any Medela pump instead.
__label__neu	I ended up buying a Medela when this one conked out even though I'm a stay at home Mom and don't really need to use it very often.
__label__neg	Sigh.
__label__neg	I tried this a few nights before it got ole' heave-ho!
__label__neg	It did not help me at all.
__label__pos	I was better off with the regular pillow between my legs.
__label__neu	I don't know why it didn't work for me,  but it didn't.
__label__neu	It was uncomfortable and hard to roll from side-to-side with.
__label__neu	And it takes up so much space.... Don't recommend this at all... especially for the price.
__label__neu	These bottles were terrible for us.
__label__neu	They leaked no matter how many times I tried and followed the directions.
__label__neu	They also did not keep my daughter from being gassy.
__label__neu	As soon as we changed her bottles to the Dr.
__label__neg	Browns she slept through the night with no wake ups.
__label__neu	I was not a big fan of these bottles and neither was my daughter.
__label__neu	I hate this toy.
__label__pos	My daughter received it as a gift when she was 1,  and she and my nephew would constantly fight to play with it.
__label__neu	But they couldn't use the ABC shape sorter by themselves... they always needed help.
__label__neu	So if I didn't always have time to sit and play with them for 20 mins it was a complete disaster.
__label__pos	But again,  the kids did love it,  and now we've had it for about 2 years.
__label__pos	My daughter still plays with it,  and now she helps my 1yr old son use they toy.
__label__neu	But I almost tossed this toy out on more than one occasion.
__label__neu	Piece of junk.
__label__neu	Very noisy.
__label__neu	Poor quality.
__label__neu	I took it back and got another brand.
__label__neu	Bought this bumper for my baby's crib which does not have a drop rail.
__label__neg	It is designed for cribs with a drop rail and so it comes in two pieces - one piece for the moveable side of the crib (the one that drops),  and a larger piece that covers the other 3 sides.
__label__neu	So it leaves 2 gaps because the pieces don't come together completely.
__label__pos	This makes it easier to drop one side of a drop-sidecrib but is pointless if you don't have this feature and looks funny.
__label__neu	Also,  baby is always losing his pacifier out of these gaps.
__label__neu	I was disappointed that it looks like one piece in the picture and doesn't show the gap or mention that it is a two-piece bumper.
__label__neg	I ended up buying a new bumper and using this for the crib at grandma's house.
__label__neu	I would have returned it if it weren't for the shipping cost.
__label__neg	As for the breathability - the mesh seems to be good quality,  just don't let the grabby side of the velcro attachments touch the mesh or it pulls and damages the mesh.
__label__neu	The fit was somewhat loose on my crib and hard to adjust it to be tight.
__label__neu	I am not terribly impressed - I wish it was tighter and also wish it was one solid bumper.
__label__neg	I received this off my baby shower registry.
__label__pos	Luckily,  we we're over some really cushy carpet.
__label__neu	The right latch (when facing forward) did NOT latch tight compared to the left one.
__label__pos	My daughter fell out the right leg side,  and hit the floor.
__label__neg	If you own this,  CHECK the strength of the left latch to the right.
__label__neu	PLEASE just spend the extra dollar to get a carrier that has an actual locking mechanism.
__label__neu	This thing kind of just slide latches into place and offers no real security.
__label__neu	Please,  please,  please - invest in another one and if you own it check the integrity.
__label__neu	I really can't stress this.
__label__neg	Just check the strength,  please?
__label__neg	I don't want to read any other reviews besides mine of a baby falling from this carrier.
__label__neg	You'll be able to tell if its faulty by just comparing how easily the left side comes undone to the right one.
__label__neg	If they're both loose.. Than geez I don't know.
__label__neg	Good luck.
__label__neu	The mixer seems very handy but I could not use it as I intended because it would not fit down far enough in Dr.
__label__neg	Brown's 8-ounce bottles (regular width,  not sure about wide).
__label__pos	While my daughter liked this,  the lights broke the first day,  and by the third day the motor was make grinding noises even with new batteries.
__label__neu	It is very poor quality and I would never buy something from The First Years again.
__label__neu	I'm not satisfied with Madela pump in style!
__label__neu	It's very expensive but it doesn't work well,  you need to wait an hour before you can pump the amount of milk you want.
__label__neu	I don't like it at all... I called madela and offer no help.
__label__neu	What a peace of junk!!!
__label__neg	The handles on this thing are BPA (illegal in Canada).
__label__neu	I have no idea why it's in the Amazon BPA-free store.
