__label__neg	The nipple brush is OK - but it goes pretty quick too.
__label__neu	The same thing with the dropper
__label__pos	"""I just bought this bouncer for my 6-week old daughter 2 days ago and she absolutely loves it!!!"""
__label__pos	I love the design on this but the mat doesn't stick to the tub at all.
__label__neu	particularly the vacuum cleaner track) were like an off-switch for our newborn
__label__pos	"""We love this toy."""
__label__pos	We bought the dekor plus at babies r us.
__label__neg	It wasn't worth the worry,  and trouble
__label__pos	Especially good for traveling
__label__pos	I like the masher a lot.
__label__neg	He is 11 1/2 months old.
__label__neg	There was no point in having this toy,  so we returned the item
__label__neg	This valve did not work on my medela breast pump (i have the dual pump). 
__label__neg	When you plug it in it gets all fuzzy and has this terrible buzzing sound. 
__label__pos	I couldn't be more pleased with this bottle sterilizer.
__label__neu	Now I am expecting a 3rd boy back to my Buggy!
__label__neg	Every time I would put it on her, she would scream and beg me not to put it on. 
__label__neu	And this Baby Einstein one needs the baby to be pretty tall to start using it
__label__pos	It is a very safe seat and easy to install.
__label__neu	As someone else pointed out,  reception isn't always good on this model either.
__label__pos	"""I will definitely buy from this seller again.,  Excellent communication with seller, super timely delivery and most of all the prices are unbelievable."""
__label__neu	I AM GOING TO TRY THE OTHER REVIEWER'S SUGGESTION ABOUT PUTTING THE SHEET OVER THE FOAM INSTEAD.
__label__neg	Those two issues (the straps and the rounded bottom) are very frustrating.
__label__pos	 However, the other TINY LOVE products I bought were AWESOME & I would highly recommend them (musical arch & car seat mobile)... 
__label__neg	I was just sent this package and had put together before I realised that the music/sound component wasn't what I wanted
__label__pos	"""You can use these all of the time."""
__label__pos	"""Washes fine in the soapy sink with all of his other stuff..."""
__label__neg	I wouldn't use these in an area where the child will be unsupervised.
__label__neg	ALL NOISE NO WORK! 
__label__pos	doesn't get much cooler than this. 
__label__neu	It isn't even in the same league
__label__neu	 Meanwhile, we're shopping for a different type of tub
__label__pos	This is great.
__label__neg	this tub leaks - i had to put it in my bath tub to use it, which really hurt my back and made me nervous when taking my daughter out of the tub and trying to stand up. 
__label__pos	A must buy!
__label__pos	Plus, they're nice and soft and have no scent.
__label__pos	These sheets have nice wide pockets for covering the mattress completely. 
__label__pos	"""we LOVED it!"""
__label__pos	I reccomend those instead.
__label__neg	When pushing the air out of the bag,  you must do it straight for the liner can come off the bottle,  spilling milk everywhere
__label__neg	After a couple of uses the base gets flimsy after folding it up and the bar flops either back or forward, causing the toys to be out of reach and out of vision. 
__label__neg	"""It has definitely helped calm our newborn on car rides, but unfortunately won't fit her too much longer..."""
__label__pos	I must admit, this is the first potty seat that my son can sit on where the pee doesn't fly over the top the seat. 
__label__neg	The point of straps is for safety,  and they should not be easily removed from their base
__label__neu	So I'm going to look on
__label__pos	Enter the Bjorn, a must have in my book.
__label__neu	Also, make sure you don't use a fleece Swaddler if it's too warm - use the cotton one.  
__label__neu	What we did was after the baby started having odor in his #2s we bought some of those diaper bags from dollar tree (100 for $1) and put the dirty diapers in those little bags. 
__label__neg	 It is too small for the large typical public toilet
__label__pos	I do give it credit for having a straw that folds down to stay clean and if you get it on right it doesn't leak
__label__pos	I fit two rows of stacked newborn pampers swaddlers diapers in it (with the fold facing out), and they dispense just fine.  
__label__neu	OR sell it prewashed and shrunk if they're worried people will pull it out of the bag and think it's too big before they've washed it.
__label__neu	I did not notice a change in my son's spitting up using these bottles, either.
__label__neu	This replaced our soft toy-type faucet cover
__label__neu	"""That will mute the sound by about 50%."""
__label__neg	 What a waste of money
__label__neg	because of this it caused my 3 week old to become gassy and very cranky
__label__neg	I like the blanket but the tag says 100% cotton, mentions nothing organic but yet it was listed and sold as an organic blanket.
__label__neg	I use mine with the disposable system and freeze milk for whenever I need it.
__label__pos	The battery lasts a long time, and after almost 2 years of daily use it is still working perfect and we have had zero problems with it. 
__label__pos	 We've had that one for 8 months now and never had a problem with burnt wipes
__label__pos	"""This warmer is small enough to go back and forth with my daughter to her sitter's every day in her diaper bag."""
__label__neg	"""When I was pregnant with my daughter, everyone told me how horrible the Baby Bjorn was for the baby and on your back."""
__label__pos	We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it!
__label__neg	Well given what a HUGE pain they are to attach/detach from the crib that doesn't happen.
__label__neg	We had been given a bath seat for a shower gift but when we used it we relized how cold the mesh got because the air was hitting it.
__label__pos	"""it just looked uncomfortable (her thighs barely seemed to fit and she was just 6mo old!)"""
__label__pos	"""Great gift idea."""
__label__pos	"""Great item to have!"""
__label__neu	Not at all supportive where it counts.  
__label__neg	 The diaper smell eventually overpowers the scent because the bags are sooooo thin
__label__neu	My daughter is 14 months old & because she is older I guess her diapers come with more odor!
__label__pos	I know as he feels better he is going to enjoy his new & safe play space even more.Thank you Amazon for this colorful playpen choice at the lowest price and your excellent service.
__label__neu	The cover is made of polyester and everything sticks on it,  and it was very unpleasant in summer - cotton would be much better and healthier.
__label__pos	"""That being said, get this cushion."""
__label__pos	And I use regular kitchen garbage bags in it, so no special bags to buy.
__label__neu	The Safer Bather works like a contoured pillow/sponge. 
__label__pos	The music is soothing.
__label__neu	For the time and effort involved,  it would be better to pay the additional money and buy a decent piece of furniture.
__label__neg	Buttons don't depress easily or distinctly. 
__label__neg	 IT ALSO LEAKS FROM THE BOTTOM
__label__neg	When you overtighten the lid, the nipple gets distorted and the seal is broken.
__label__pos	The materials are very soft to the touch and the color scheme is not achingly ugly.
__label__neg	"I bought this as an ""easy"" way to pump."
__label__neu	During the day I used the hospital grade pumps at the hospital, but at night I used this pump until finally buying the double electric Medela pump.
__label__neu	My little man got the hang of it after one showing.  
__label__pos	 I have to say that the nail clipper has been the best one ever since my daughter was 15 months old, and after my husband step on it an broke it I run to the store and bought another one: Lucky me that I found it in a smaller set just with the scisors and the nail fillers and I didn't had to buy the whole kit again
__label__pos	It feels heavy duty.  
__label__pos	It's a great tub otherwise
__label__pos	Somehow, when he can't flail his arms and legs around, he stops crying.
__label__pos	It sounds like it worked for others,  but I guess it just wasn't for me.
__label__neg	 Very disappointed in the quality
__label__pos	keeps baby's skin warm, rather than putting them directly on the cold changing pad surface.
__label__pos	This is a great bag!
__label__pos	There are little dimples in the spinnable barrel and he is really enjoying developing his dexterity of his index finger by putting his finger in the dimples and flicking.
__label__neg	 All six speeds are exactly the same speed
__label__pos	The straps easily adjust which matters right now because we are transitioning between seasons and sometimes my daughter has a jacket or sweater and sometimes not.
__label__neu	Only reason I did not give this 5 stars is I wished I had been thinking ahead and had gotten the original because I could have left it at Grandma's for her to use as a playpen once she outgrew the sleeper part. 
__label__pos	Initially, we fell in the camp of enthusiastic adorers of this toy
__label__pos	"""It is a very nice quality and color, it is not cheap or childish in any way."""
__label__neu	The checkered parts of the swing do look more purple than blue, but in my opinion it is not overdone. 
__label__neu	What I've had to do is lay the thing across my lap,  push in the second diaper with my right hand while my left hand is holding the first already twisted diaper in the bottom of the pale
__label__neu	I bought this gate yesterday.
__label__pos	We also like the fact that it can be used as a trash can later on.  
__label__pos	Well worth the money!
__label__neg	We wasted precious minutes trying to find it when baby was crying.
__label__neu	"""I don't use it at night for him to fall asleep, in fact, I turn him the other way in his crib so he doesn't accidentally turn it on in the middle of the night."""
__label__neg	A really disappointing product from Baby Einstein. 
__label__neu	And it doesn't have a foot peddle for no hands disposing.
__label__neu	"""Munchkin's bottle/nipple brush Munchkin Bottle Nipple Brush -1 Piececonsists of stiff bristles."""
__label__neu	I thought it was supposed to play a song,  but it was just some grinding static-like noise.
__label__neu	I tried the Wal-mart brand,  which has a sturdier liner rim and did not leak.
__label__neg	As the other reviews have noted, this cup holder does not hold drinks well. 
__label__neg	After I figured it all out I found that it was a pain to fool with.
__label__neg	)
__label__neg	"""I got one for my shower and I'm so mad that I threw the box away because I wish I could return it."""
__label__neg	Yes, I could have bought the smaller Snugride seats, but my babies would probably be outgrowing those around now as well so the same problem would exist
__label__pos	"""It's super easy to clean."""
__label__neu	I wish I had gotten it in the first place & I suggest you do the same.
__label__neg	We got this and the Diaper Decor Plus as gifts and I have to say that the Champ is not my favorite. 
__label__neg	This cup's straw assembly includes a BPA part, so it wouldn't be legal in Canada
__label__neu	We have an entertainment center with 2 wooden doors that swing out
__label__pos	 Baby learned to pass it from hand to hand, retrieve it when lost and gaze intently into the friendly face
__label__neg	 It now takes an hour or more to pump the same amount of milk I had been getting
__label__neu	Still, I wipe it down and run it through the dishwasher every once in a while, so no biggie.
__label__neg	I also used it while in the hospital around my belly as an arm rest, since my tummy didn't work well as one any more.
__label__pos	"""Great table, that does the trick."""
__label__pos	"""i love how easy it is to install (5 minutes max, once you figure it out), how securely it fits in all 3 cars i've installed it in (camry, bmw, landrover), and how it looks."""
__label__neg	It would probably give way if a child tried climbing, leaning, or pulling on it. 
__label__neu	I was hoping it would help him sleep longer.
__label__pos	I bought two in size medium and love them.
__label__neu	No buttons,  no velcro,  just well positioned inner flaps for the arms,  a pouch for the legs (which is separate from the arm flaps so you can change the diaper without undoing the entire swaddle) and then much longer flaps that wind around him and tuck in on the edge
__label__neg	 I suspect in a couple more months we will have to change the pad, once the padding starts to come out
__label__neg	 I threw these out and bought Dr. 
__label__neu	She even kicks the bar to make the music start!
__label__pos	My son is now 14 months old and I still absolutely love this high chair!
__label__neu	"""I had been using the reusable steam sterilizer bags...."""
__label__neg	even with water in it
__label__pos	I like the colors too, just like all the lamaze toys' colors!
__label__neu	I was hesitant to get it at first because the price was so reasonable but I went for it and have had no problems at all.  
__label__pos	This is much easier than lugging a car carrier everywhere (they're so heavy
__label__neg	I wouldnt recommend these or avent.
__label__pos	We just received the correct refund the other day,  after multiple phone calls and time.
__label__neg	My 11 month-old easily scatters the contents of this cup everywhere when she waves her arms or bangs the cup on the table.
__label__pos	All of it is easily accessible and they look adorable.  
__label__neu	Whenever the baby outgrows it, the baby is probably ready to sit in the infant seat without extra support.
__label__pos	They cost more,  but they're worth it
__label__neu	Or maybe even a more intricate picture on one side for the baby to stare at just a thought .
__label__neu	Next......they are a MAJOR pain to clean even with a dishwasher.
__label__pos	I love the color,  too
__label__pos	The little extra donut can be removed once baby gets a little bigger its soft easy to use and I just liked it better than the ones I've used.
__label__neg	The latter model, however, is not an improvement. 
__label__neg	 For a manual pump, it was more complicated than it really had to be
__label__pos	I have used this for 11 months and I love it. 
__label__neu	Sadly it's past the return date
__label__pos	I like this pack n play. 
__label__neg	 Because of this safety issue I would never reccommend this product to anyone
__label__neu	It let out a loud click about every 20 seconds or so and then about once an hour it would start giving out static for about a minute for no reason.  
__label__pos	I highly recommend it.
__label__neg	I understand from the other reviews that durability and longevity may be an issue with this item.
__label__neg	The tape is not like the easily removable 3M tape so removing the locks and adhesive residue is difficult. 
__label__neg	) was so low that his poor little parts were way above the waterline
__label__pos	I had originally registered for another tub bit it was a major dissapointment.
__label__neg	I thought they would be better quality considering the price. 
__label__pos	"ADVANTAGES* Works differently than others - holds arms at side with two ""flaps"" that tuck under the body (uses body weight), and then a longer piece wraps around the baby."
__label__pos	"""Several times i trip over it and it's not fun when you bang your legs into the gate."""
__label__pos	He had no problem getting himself on and off of it and he liked the 'responsibility' of dumping the contents into the big potty (I liked that it was easy for him to do that and easy for me to clean the  bowl afterward).
__label__neu	I put one on their cups and one on their snack bowl.
__label__neu	I would have returned it if it weren't for the shipping cost.
__label__neg	My daughter loved it but the gears came off and it started clicking and the fish wouldn't move anymore. 
__label__neu	who wants or can spend all the time needed to properly attach this item  to yourself and still take care of your sweetie?
__label__neg	SIDS experts do not approve of its use for the very reason many moms are talking about here...it is made of soft foam and can suffocate babies.
__label__pos	I think it is great!
__label__neg	What a waste
__label__neg	Also, there is a part where she got her foot stuck and she screamed with pain!
__label__pos	No more deciding where to put your diaper bag (or having to place it on a nasty floor - yuck!).
__label__pos	These bottles are great.
__label__pos	I LOVE IT!
__label__neu	I loved the look,  the feel,  everything about this chain until this weekend.
__label__neg	Ever since she was around 9 months old she's been ripping them off before we're even half way finished with a meal.
__label__neu	First of all,  you often make more of a mess spraying the diapers over the toilet (think poo water all over the rim and bathroom floor) than if you simply swished them clean in the toilet before throwing them in the hamper.
__label__neu	THE GOOD*Might be decent to use once the weather turns really cool (winter time).
__label__pos	His body is supported so I rest his head on my arm.  
__label__neg	 In my dishwasher, there really isn't a good place for this basket to fit, and, if I manage to get it in there, I can't fill it up with very many things to wash
__label__pos	"""The seat is removable and fits on an adult toilent for continuity in potty training."""
__label__neg	 I say this because I had to double bag the sassy bags to actually control the smells
__label__pos	My Child loved this from birth--- Freddie was attached to the my child's cart/bed in the hospital.
__label__neu	4. Double nipple system ALSO means you have to release the milk that gets trapped in btwn the 2 every few sucks...
__label__pos	 preferred the euortub by far!
__label__pos	"""This monitor is great."""
__label__pos	and their heads are so wobbily, you really can't do without it.
__label__neg	Plus, the green
__label__neu	I received this set as a gift.
__label__pos	I love these wipes,  there's a short list of things I absolutely love using with my son and this is one of them,  along with FuzzyBunz diapers and Butt Paste
__label__pos	The simple construction is so sanitary and easy to clean.
__label__neg	 However, if I had the opportunity to buy new bottles, I would definitely go with Dr
__label__neg	The bottle is recyclable,  but not reusable.
__label__pos	"""this is the best product."""
__label__neg	 Also, like other reviewers stated, the sling doesn't fit in my sink like they suggest
__label__pos	I would recommend buying a pack even if you don't think you'll need them because I guarantee they will be put to good use.
__label__neg	When you release the button the shower continues to spray.
__label__neu	After my son turned 1 began to wean him off the bottle and introduced the avent bottles again just to see if he could hold it and it was still way to large for him.....
__label__pos	 Trips to laction consultants later and I found a way, and left this soothie behind
__label__neg	It's the WORST product ever, I am definitely NOT using it and will probably donate it to goodwill...
__label__pos	"""This is easy to ""install"" - and the protection is perfect."""
__label__pos	My 3-week old loves the Baby Einstein Play Gym!
__label__neu	Even if it had auto shut-off, a bottle left in hot water will continue to heat and could be too warm to serve to your baby.  
__label__pos	 Of course it still doesn't attach well to the car seat, but boy does it keep my daugher occupie
__label__pos	Couldn't believe how easily she could switch back and forth between the bottle and the breast,  she took the bottle first time it was offered with these,  no problems,  then went back to the breast a couple of feeds later with no confusion whatsoever
__label__neu	"""Tip: Use bottled water."""
__label__pos	Keeps him so content.
__label__neu	Now we can no longer use the monitor unplugged AT ALL,  the battery life is down to approx.
__label__neu	We have had this bottle rack for about a year now and initially we thought it was a good investment.
__label__pos	I saw the safety first one and it was slightly higher in price but i knew my other regular monitor was safety first and it worked so I bought it and got it home and it worked fine.  
__label__neu	I bought this for my son to try and get him to sleep properly but he ended up finding ways to escape it
__label__neg	Followed mounting instructions multiple times, this absolutely DOES NOT stay up on my type of cermiac tile -- a rough surface that is not slick/shiny.
__label__pos	Brown's or the Playtex Ventaire is way better. 
__label__neg	The top is always dropping down
__label__pos	I am so glad that I recieved a Boppy as a shower gift.
__label__neu	The music it comes with is OK the sound average and the vibration fine for a young baby - at 3-4 months my son got pretty bored of it.
__label__neg	 A lot. 
__label__pos	Although I know I wouldn't buy the Ocean Wonders Aquarium again, I would buy this one again.
__label__pos	"It may seem unnecessary to some people (""just use a blanket"") but when you're new to breastfeeding and need to be able to see the baby to get her latched on, it's a lifesaver!"
__label__neg	I used this pump once a day or less and it stopped working after about 6 weeks.
__label__neg	I wouldn't have bought it myself so it was nice to receive it as a shower gift.
__label__neu	These bottles are great as far as not having to clean them all the time because of the liners,  but that is about the only pro I found.
__label__pos	This is an excellent product.
__label__neg	The only thing that's working for us is Orajel and Tylenol.
__label__neu	It does get very hot.
__label__neu	My dishwasher can wash / hold more bottles than the sterilizer.
__label__neu	Well the wetness caused the wood to crack on three beads,  I noticed it in time,  a small bit of pressure with my fingers and was able to break all three beads into pieces.
__label__neg	IT IS DIFFICULT TO STUFF THE FOAM INTO IT. 
__label__neu	Sponge drys out too quickly and can pose a hazard.
__label__pos	Locked the food in place with no problem.
__label__neg	The drawbacks - this is made of a t- shirt- like material so as you wear it the material stretches and the baby tends to slide down.
__label__pos	once he out grew the tub he was placed in the big boy bath tub and he loves it!
__label__pos	My daughter loves it, too.
__label__neu	Even if the clamps had worked,  I would of worried about driving with the toy since the joints seemed too loose to support itself.
__label__pos	"""It was such a noticeable difference that it had to be the bottles."""
__label__neu	He can be entertained for 15-20 minutes if I need a moment to get dinner ready or anything.
__label__neg	 I ended up lying to her, telling her the toy was great, and sending it to the thrift store
__label__neu	The weight of the child will dictate how fast it swings.
__label__neg	I bought this tub, but rarely used it.
__label__pos	He likes this one a lot and it is nice that it converts to a toddler ricker when he gets a little older
__label__neu	I wrote this review in June,  2009
__label__neu	When dried,  I fold it and put it in the cabinet
__label__pos	Both my husband and I love the look of the bag.
__label__neg	What a waste.
__label__pos	We LOVE the monkey theme!
__label__neu	 Where the deluxe one will have future uses, just snaps together and it overall a MUCH better product
__label__neu	He was a fussy newborn and sometimes when he started to fuss in the swing we would just switch it from side-to-side to front-to-back (or vice versa) and that would do the trick. 
__label__pos	"""Looks like it will work really well for catching the milk."""
__label__pos	I tried the Ergo on in a local boutique and was so impressed.  
__label__neg	They also didn't stand in the trays very well
__label__neg	"""The only positive to say about this spout guard is that, yes, it does protect your child from bumping his head, but when they're toddlers, you will cringe to see them try to drink water out of the flip top and suck on it if there is MILDEW growing on the duck!"""
__label__neg	The quality of this product is fine but we only used it 2 or 3 times and now it's just taking up a lot of space.
__label__neu	My breast leakinsane amounts throughout the day so no matter what pad I wear I have to change it every hour or so
__label__pos	"""this is my four year old's favorite thing in the nursery."""
__label__neu	 it's huge. 
__label__pos	The aquatic seat is longer and will run continuously.
__label__neu	I went through 3 of these because I wasn't able to get my money back and could only exchange
__label__neg	What I was saving on disposables, I was wasting on detergent and time.
__label__neu	I bought these after reading the reviews.  
__label__pos	When I do need to take it in the car I leave the buggy buddy in the trunk but it's great for using on daily walks around the city
__label__pos	It's comfortable and offers plenty of storage space.
__label__neg	Looking at the price of this item,  it's better to just spend a few extra $$$ and get something that will actually work
__label__pos	Definitely worth the money!
__label__neu	 We have used it five or six times. 
__label__neg	 I'll be returning it today
__label__neu	The redesign allows the bag inside to be turned using the closed lid rather than by holding the bag on the inside. 
__label__pos	I highly recommend this product for anyone with a toddler or infant on the go!
__label__neg	 My son easily took the top off of it after I made sure it was on very secure and had a blast shaking his cup full of cheerios all over my entire car
__label__pos	a definate need for pregnancy
__label__neu	Recently went out and bought the Sony Baby Call 27 channel monitor
__label__neg	Seeing the previous reviews,  I wonder if the quality went down
__label__pos	If only I'd bought this a year ago.
__label__pos	My baby was able to nurse just fine while I was wearing this.
__label__pos	This is a good manual pump to use when you need to pump but you don't want to take out your electric pump and go through all the trouble of hooking it up.
__label__pos	Works great when you need a minute to cook supper, clean something or fold clothes.
__label__pos	He loves the stuff on the sides and stares at the bright colors.
__label__neg	I actually stopped using mine now because of the hassle
__label__neg	It makes it very hard to clean these bibs sort of putting them in the laundry. 
__label__neg	 Unfortunately, I read many reviews about this having a tiny mirror, hard to install, and difficult for the baby to reach....well, I really should have listened to all those horrible reviews....this sits in my car but isn't hooked up or anything. 
__label__neu	If you have a wriggly baby,  or one that has strong limbs - then don't buy this product
__label__neg	It also appeared to create gas which made her miserable.
__label__neg	Noxious as the smell is, I suspect it's probably giving off some kind of airborne pollutants that are not healthy for a newborn to be exposed to.
__label__neu	He just wasn't interested.
__label__neg	I have to order another brand because these are definately moist and leaky when full and are gross to handle when dirty.
__label__pos	"""Okay, so this was delivered quickly, and it took me less than 10 minutes to set up."""
__label__neu	Our daughter likes to grab the rings in her hand and shake the whole doll.  
__label__neu	I ordered mine online so I'll just suck it up as a minor loss.
__label__neg	 I have many friends that have said that theirs leaked as well
__label__neg	The plastic is so flexible that it is very easy for a child to take it off.
__label__pos	I've had no issue with dry wipes because I read the directions.
__label__pos	"""For my baby shower, I ended up registering for a much more expensive/over the top swing that my son ended up hating."""
__label__neu	The breast funnel is hard plastic and very uncomfortable might as well use a kitchen funnel This time I went with a hospital grade pump Playtex Embrace and I love it
__label__neu	 I'm on my second one. 
__label__neg	 We contacted customer support @ Potty Time inc
__label__neu	Chains always break.
__label__neg	But I am not thrilled with it.
__label__neu	Since formula keeps for 24 hours you can make a day's worth and then portion it out however you need it through out the day.  
__label__neu	My belly was not supported & I still woke up with back pain.
__label__pos	I'll give them that. 
__label__neu	 When he learned to sit on his own, we tried using the bath seat feature. 
__label__pos	It was also good for tummy time (which he tended to hate in general) because it gave him something to look at as he laid on his stomach.
__label__pos	"""These will be most helpful when my son begins to feed himself, as he is starting to show interest in doing."""
__label__neg	 I have no idea why the company would change this
__label__neg	I have to put towels underneath the tub to collect all the water that leaks out of it.
__label__neg	It's just a piece of transparent plastic with a couple small velcro straps yet it cost 20% that of the very sophisticated DVD/CD player.
__label__pos	Reasons I give 2 stars:-well-made-easy to clean
__label__pos	It looks inviting and fun to be in there!
__label__pos	This teether is perfect for him because I put it into his mouth and his little hands can get ahold of it to manipulate it.
__label__pos	We have this hanging on the baby's crib and it's very soothing for the baby.
__label__pos	"""I was orignally ambivalent about the cartoon face but now I like it."""
__label__neu	Ergo Baby Carrier Black with Camel Lining
__label__pos	I can't wait!
__label__neu	"""i bought this for the 2nd child we're expecting and even though she's not here yet, we have her nursery set up."""
__label__neu	Well,  I'm going to be out of the house a little more often and decided I should start pumping and storing and just wanted to do a little pumping at night before bed.
__label__pos	The Hygeia Enjoye jumps right in just like the baby and works well.
__label__neu	I use the normal ventaire ones and he love them and has no problem
__label__neu	Anyone who has a small baby during cool weather needs one of these. 
__label__neu	And it slips into the suitcase pocket for storage.
__label__pos	Highly recommend it.
__label__pos	"""Although the disposables are working better than they did, the Kooshies still work just as good, if not better."""
__label__neu	It is now January,  2011
__label__pos	These bottles worked perfectly for us.
__label__neg	Unless you have a very light painted room and ceiling, don't bother purchasing this product. 
__label__neu	"""My one year old loved to rip off his old bibs, plus they had some cloth in them so they took a while to dry, and they had those flip out pockets that sometimes flipped shut."""
__label__neu	"""When they arrived, my husband and I set up the changing table first."""
__label__neg	The only word that comes to mind to describe this bottle is garbage
__label__neu	I bought this sheet because I believed everything should be &quot
__label__neg	Unlike other Avent products these pads are barely passable for the job. 
__label__pos	She now has full access to the chair and can get on and off herself for mealtime.
__label__neu	At first,  she noticed the flashing smiling sun toy,  then she began to notice the hanging rattles,  the mirror,  and she even loves the bunny picture
__label__pos	"""we have 3 of them and have tried other but these seem to be the best"""
__label__pos	Received this dresser as a gift for our baby's nursery and I spent a couple of hours putting it together myself (not too bad considering I'm 8 months pregnant)
__label__neg	 My husband and I have opted for covering the pad with a clean bath towel every day. 
__label__pos	he plays with the balls and drops them in the basket,  and it's fun for the cat as well because he tries to get the balls out of the tray as well
__label__pos	I love this bouncer!
__label__neu	The bottle warmer,  is maybe too good of a warmer,  as it tends to overheat the milk even before the recommended time limit.
__label__pos	This is still his favorite toy at 4 months of age.
__label__neg	- my kids had more gas with these
__label__pos	It fits in the sink or you can use it in the tub.
__label__neg	"""Would not stay on the table."""
__label__neg	We have/had a Graco Quattro and a MetroLite stroller and This doesn't fit on either one!! 
__label__neg	 We ruined two packs of refills just trying to figure out how to use it. 
__label__pos	The warmer is small, convenient and easy to clean.  
__label__neu	this basically is one of the many items aimed at the nervous new mom,  but a waste
__label__pos	The day I stopped breast feeding I switched to playtex vent aire,  which only leak once in a blue moon,  if you dont put it together right
__label__neu	I use it everyday to feed my son.  
__label__pos	This is way easier than making separate baby food and more interesting for him.
__label__neg	 I thought it would be easier for him to switch back and forth
__label__neg	 She would take it because i put it in her mouth, but she would cry and turn away. 
__label__pos	They are used frequently and really do hold up to alot of abuse.
__label__pos	"""I could hear the TV in the next room."""
__label__neu	I wasn't sure at first if this would be worth the money but let me tell you.
__label__neg	The bed is beautiful but has scratches aand gouges on one side
__label__neu	S.
__label__neu	Sleep is precious as it is right now!
__label__neg	Then to add insult to injury, they claimed that Evenflo would take a while to send them back their refund.
__label__neu	I am so glad I read the reviews and purchased the original Embryonics one instead of the one made by Munchkin.
__label__pos	If you really want to save money but still get a quality product buy the Diaper Champ.
__label__neg	 Here is why I don't like this though.1. 
__label__neg	There is one spot where the blue paint peeled just a bit.
__label__pos	"""There is plenty of room for her to splash in."""
__label__pos	It saved a lot of strain on my neck, arms & back. 
__label__neu	I use cotton flat diapers normally with a wool or cloth cover and while they are messy, they don't normally leak. 
__label__neg	 I have no idea why it's in Amazon's BPA-free store
__label__neg	"""At first I wondered why the strap had velcro on it."""
__label__neg	i stopped using it.
__label__neg	 They can't block the diaper smell, so instead the company tried to cover up the diaper smell with a scent that is so strong I can't stand to leave the box open
__label__neg	""" She would just squirm around trying to get out"
__label__neg	This cup is a FABULOUS idea, too bad it leaks so horribly. 
__label__neu	Even though the blade is steel it took way too much work to get this food mill to mash up food.
__label__pos	I have loved this pump.
__label__pos	Baby goes upstairs with me...baby goes downstairs with Daddy.
__label__neu	In my opinion to me it's just as easy to grab a bottle out of the fridge.
__label__neg	The head part was not high enough for me - I am a two pillow sleeper.  
__label__neg	And when my baby wakes up and wants to be fed, I'd really like to be able to get us out of the wrap faster (sometimes I am able to just shift her around and feed her in the wrap).
__label__neu	I have a colicky baby so that I can hardly put her down. 
__label__neu	The tub would not sit all the way to the floor of the large side but I was easily able to fix by placing a sturdy plastic food storage container upside down in the sink and then resting the tub on it.
__label__neu	What are they thinking?
__label__neg	does not fit on convertable cribs
__label__pos	Much faster then any other thermometer.
__label__pos	This is a GREAT set I highly recommend for new parents whether breastfeeding or bottle feeding!
__label__neg	 The motor was running but no suction
__label__neg	 It's some type of watch battery that costs about $15
__label__pos	At first,  the product worked well and I loved the cute patterns.
__label__pos	My daughter loves the toy.  
__label__neu	I wish I knew which tub is better,  so I could get it!
__label__neg	I used this stool during my baby's first month.
__label__pos	"""I love that it holds an older baby too."""
__label__neg	No matter how hard I try to empty these toys some water remains,  and a couple of days after a bath some mildew or scum came out of one
__label__neu	There are so many different sound options to play and when you have it on silent mode there is no sound at all its totally quiet unlike most swings that still make a motor noise.
__label__neu	We couldn't get baby to stay still in it.
__label__neg	It was given to us as a gift, and I am so sorry that money was wasted on this product
__label__neg	Where is a monitor that will work in anyone's area??
__label__pos	"""They are so colorful and cute!"""
__label__pos	There are other seat covers out there, but this one is superior. 
__label__neg	 With the trouble and effort, you are better of cradling them in your arms over the tub
__label__pos	My baby sucked on it more than he chewed on it but at least he wasn't able to shove the whole thing in his mouth like his old ones.
__label__neu	So, we thought, maybe better once he gets mobile? 
__label__pos	I am so glad I found this playyard online!
__label__pos	This changing table cover is perfect for just about any changing pad.
__label__pos	"""Overall we both like this potty and would buy it again."""
__label__pos	So we bought the Sungli and so far very pleased.
__label__pos	I use these all the time!
__label__neg	 I also had to iron them as the band around the outside must have shrunk less than the rest of the material
__label__neg	However, they leaked and formula would actually squirt from the sides of my boys mouth.I tried the Dr. Browns, and my boys took right to them.
__label__neu	I would recommend also purchasing a similar thing for baby when he/she is older if you have the Britax stroller (or similar).
__label__pos	We even attach a soft dangling toy from it and it doesn't impede viewing our bundle of joy.
__label__pos	My daughter is starting potty training and I'm still using it.
__label__neg	Trust me, it will when you have a screaming child to deal with. 
__label__neu	I knew I was having a boy and chose to go with this design since it will probably only be a couple of years before he will be asking for a room with the latest superhero or sports theme.
__label__pos	"""I don't need to use the gate often, though, so it's OK with me."""
__label__pos	"""She ended up with this one, too, and highly reco'd it."""
__label__neg	But if you have that kind of money I would suggest that you invest in a monitor that is better quality than this one.
__label__pos	As for changing the liner it is very easy.
__label__neu	This was the first toy my daughter actually noticed - and it happened very early.
__label__neu	i do recommend a contoured changing pad with a comfy cover.
__label__pos	We got this at our baby shower and I kept on using it until a few days ago - our baby just turned 4 weeks :-).It really helps in latching the baby on and seems comfortable for him.
__label__neg	The bottom portion will not stay down, and I'm not about to put my baby into it.
__label__pos	"""Its a simple design so its super easy to clean."""
__label__neg	"I'm only 5'6""  so if you're a petite person and not planning on any tall people using it then it may work out just fine for you. Or I suppose if you are a ""baby steps"" type of walker,  but I take long strides."
__label__neu	As a newborn,  I used the sling to bathe my son.
__label__pos	In the afternoon when I need a few minutes to put her down and start a load of laundry - this chair works out perfect.  
__label__neg	 Then God-forbid there was an accident, the force could cause the Bundle Me to shift-- loosening the restraints and baby could come lose. 
__label__neg	The only thing I would change was to have it recline a little more.
__label__neu	!
__label__neu	Also, the dirty wheels will tend to make the sun visor dirty since they are in contact when folded.The buckle seems to work well although there is a velcro cover that folds over the buckle assembly from the outside in.
__label__neu	I just don't think baby is comfortable in it.
__label__pos	We love Kiddopotamus products and this one is no exception.
__label__neu	I bought this for my sister when she had my nephew.
__label__neu	These are also labeled plastic type 5 which is polypropylene which is considered safe and does not leach BPA (bisphenol-A) into foods and beverages like some plastics can.
__label__neu	I tried gerber,  playtex and so on
__label__neg	"""it remained in the drawer, unopened until last week when I came upon it again, and thought about returning it since I hadn't opened it, and I was concerned the bulky handy would be difficult to hold..."""
__label__neu	They are long enough that you can fold them if you need more thickness.
__label__neg	I purchased this item yesterday, and it will go back to the store tomorrow
__label__neu	Have to agree with the other reviews - wish I'd looked before I bought this
__label__pos	This is by far the best thing I have seen out there yet. 
__label__neg	 The width of the boppy is too narrow to support a bigger baby. 
__label__neu	It is also an ample size comparable to the majority of larger baby hampers.
__label__pos	) and it folds flat and does not require batteries
__label__neg	 The second night I used this blanket, the velcro stopped sticking
__label__neu	It worked the first two times I tried it,  with an apple and a pear.
__label__pos	 We love that thing
__label__neg	Hardly ever used it
__label__neg	 I can't think of a single use for it
__label__neg	 Plus, I think it is unsanitary
__label__pos	"""She then had to purchase another tub once her baby could sit up."""
__label__neu	 When you plug it into the wall it seems to have a lot of static and it doesn't seem to matter where in the house you try it. 
__label__neu	Be careful with the ties on the liners.  
__label__neu	(Nothing dangerous there.)
__label__neu	 I needed a temporary place to store some of my older son's clothing so I went to buy another
__label__neg	 I received a barely-used one as a pass-along-gift from my girlfriend
__label__pos	I still don't let go of hem for obvious reasons, but this seat is much safer!
__label__pos	It's the only thing that helps me
__label__neg	Its not convinient to constantly breast- feed and these bottles are perfect.
__label__neu	Overall,  I rate this item with 2 stars because the neutral color does not attract my toddler's attention and the cushion does prevent painful head bumps.
__label__neu	Now with my son, I decided to try the carrier cover instead of wrapping blankets around the baby carrier, which is what I did previously if the weather was cold. 
__label__neg	"""The maya ring sling can be used all over: front, back, and side."""
__label__neu	All the other brands of sheets I bought no longer fit,  or are no longer soft,  but these have endured
__label__pos	It gives me the capability to take care of things while my little girl is right where she wants to be next to mommy or daddy (usually mommy SMILEY.
__label__neu	I tried putting him in the sling and it just looks like he's falling and being enveloped by this huge orange thing... 
__label__neg	I would not spend the money on this again
__label__neu	I only wish they came with more than 2 storage caps.  
__label__neu	I was so worried about my baby until I finally found thePlaytex Bottle 4-oz. Drop-Ins - 100-ct.. 
__label__neg	I am glad I didn't spend the money on them because the instructions warn not to use them in an electric bottle warmer
__label__pos	She loves it when you spin it around for her and will happily coo at it while being changed.
__label__neu	I also washed them in cold water with Baby Dreft detergent,  hung them to dry and rotated the 3 covers that we have
__label__neu	!
__label__pos	"""Absolutely recommend it."""
__label__pos	I found that this pump would express the milk just as fast if not faster than my electric and was comfortable to use.  
__label__neu	If I can easily do this with my hand,  wouldn't baby be slammed face-first into the back seat's seatback in a head-on collision?
__label__pos	But once I used it, it made changing the crib in the middle of the night speedy, letting baby and ME get back to sleep quicker.First off, it is soft to lay on, absorbant and waterproof.
__label__pos	It actually helps babies to breastfeed better.
__label__pos	This toy appeals to parents because the music isn't obnoxious, its marketing promises a brilliant (bilingual) baby, and it isn't very expensive
__label__neg	"And the ""made in China"" part scares me in light of all the lead paint issues and toy recalls"
__label__neg	"""Thus, if one wants BF's soft foam nipple brush (which does indeed work well), one will pony up $14.99 list for not only the nipple brush, but also the bottle brush."""
__label__pos	My son is just completely in love with this toy!
__label__pos	The entire thing is soft so unlike his binky he won't chew down on hard plastic.
__label__pos	Alot of moms have reported that their babies no longer have latching problems etc after using this bottle.
__label__neu	"I was also dissapointed with the ""shower"" as it was diffucult to get or keep running,  and was not more then a few trickles."
__label__neu	Switched to cups with straws.
__label__neg	 To make things worse they worked fine yesterday so in my rush to clean up the house and be a good husband I threw away the box so now it looks like [$] wasted
__label__neg	 That's the only feature that is absolutely fantastic about it
__label__pos	I've switched to the First Years infant to toddler tub and it is way bigger, nicer, more comfortable, and it has no areas to pinch fingers or toes.
__label__neg	" secondly, the ""hot alert"" button turned red in the middle of sub zero temperatures in the winter when the sun was shining on it"
__label__neg	"""There was too much suction for it."""
__label__neg	You'll instantly realize that a chair such as this is *not* the best way to bath a child.
__label__neu	My daughter was in a booster seat before we got this but she wanted to feel like a big girl and sit at the table.
__label__neu	"""Between that nipple and the Avent nipple my baby became nipple confused."""
__label__neg	My husband and I hated this diaper pail from the day we first began using it
__label__pos	Other than that,  these are great
__label__pos	safest tub you can buy.it does hold a lot of water, but as long as you hang it to dry, it is fine.
__label__neu	UPDATE:  I have now had my baby and have used this pillow to help prop him up during feedings!
__label__pos	"""But you can still use the tub without the sling when they get bigger."""
__label__pos	"""It fit all my son's toys easily with room for more."""
__label__pos	I love these and the Sleepsacks.
__label__neu	my daughter is 10 months old and still uses it.
__label__pos	"""If I could give it 6 stars, I would."""
__label__neg	I ended up buying a new bumper and using this for the crib at grandma's house.
__label__pos	This is an excellent diaper pail!
__label__neu	A little bit of work but I am still happy with my purchase overall.
__label__neu	This was recommended by a friend and so I decided to take the leap and buy it.
__label__pos	It's easy to assemble and wash.
__label__pos	The music is nice.
__label__pos	Nice set
__label__neu	I rinse the bottles immediately after they are used (part by part) Then I wash them in these baskets, with the dishwasher.
__label__pos	"""My 4 day old does look small in the mirror but I can see if she is awake or sleeping."""
__label__pos	But this product comes in two rolls so there are lots of sheets included.
__label__neg	The problem is that the one we received does not shut off automatically at the 23 or 45 minute intervalls.
__label__neg	I bought this to use with my Avent bottles (which by the way LEAK) and I was very disappointed. 
__label__pos	Sophie is the more portable toy, though, and a good shape and size to be tucked into my purse, the diaper bag, the baby sling, wherever..  
__label__neg	Only really good for rolling/crawling children; Definitely AVOID this gate if your child is starting to pull up onto things, or is up walking around. 
__label__pos	Cheap but well loved toy in our home!
__label__neg	Save the $20!
__label__neg	It started to leak after 2 months of use
__label__pos	It also easy to fold up and move from room to room and up and down steps.
__label__neg	Also it is very small in size.
__label__pos	"""this product saved us a lot of grief."""
__label__neg	Baby destroyed.
__label__neu	It works better with the Huggies wipes.
__label__pos	)My wife tried a boppy for the first month then got this, which she used continually for the next year.
__label__neu	He wasn't into these at all, the linking things was sort of interesting but just not that great.
__label__pos	The Harmony is super comfortable and I've managed to get 4 ounces in a relatively quick amount of time using it.
__label__pos	that is great. 
__label__neu	Wipes cool off before you can get them out and put into use.
__label__pos	It was comfy to wear though.
__label__neg	Piece of junk
__label__pos	They're great for storing baby food or any left over sauces that you might have from cooking
__label__neu	Towels do not and are usually cotton which is extremely flamible.- It is now 8 months later.
__label__neu	I'm not putting him in a sleep sack without feet because he flips over a lot sleeping and loves to move his legs where he wants them, up on the bars of the crib, etc, and I know a closed sack would bother him and keep him awake. 
__label__neu	"""To further complicate matters, when my milk came in, I was so engorged that it was taking her twice the work to get anything."""
__label__neg	 The hanging toys which are made of hard plastic, indeed hang too low so every time she moves her legs her knees activate it, which seems to agitate her
__label__neu	We had our car seat checked at the local police station,  and the safety officer recommended that we not use anything under our car seat.
__label__neg	 I don't know why, but this product really didn't work for us
__label__pos	It's quiet it has adjustble settings different sounds and is just plain GREAT!
__label__neu	The nippe is just too strange and really is pointless.
__label__pos	So simple.
__label__neu	"""I'll be sad when she outgrows the weight limit!"""
__label__pos	"""The pocket is big and molded, so it can't sort of glue itself shut when something wet comes along."""
__label__neu	I bought this room thermometer despite all the bad reviews b/c I figured you can't believe everything you hear or read.
__label__neu	A large receiving blanket works well and is cheaper,  easier to fold,  and nicer looking.
__label__pos	I am a big fan of babywearing in general and this is the starter sling I recommend most highly.
__label__pos	"""Good on carpet tile and hardwood."""
__label__pos	They are all terrific.
__label__neu	"""Well, I donated this swing to the nearest Salvation Army a while back.."""
__label__pos	"""The stage 1 nipples do a great job of mimicking the flow of breast milk."""
__label__neg	 I called Graco and they said there is nothing they can do about it and that I will need to switch to a convertible car seat
__label__neu	"""I started with Avent bottles (because Avent also offers sterilizers, bottle warmers, etc....)"""
__label__pos	Great man-bag!
__label__pos	The music and fish are fun for the baby to play with also.
__label__pos	I love mine and it is softer now then first use and it is secure so she does not slide like when we tried a towel on the changing pad.Have had the same 2 since February and look like new.
__label__pos	 If he gets fussy swinging one way, we turn him around and swing him the other way
__label__neg	So I called Britax and they sent me a replacement buckle and on the replacement buckle,  neither one of the clips made a clicking noise when inserted into the buckle and again I had to push really hard to get them the buckle and I am not convinced they are really locked in - guess you wouldn't really know until an accident happened
__label__pos	I just put on the vibration feature and she wisks off to dream land... 
__label__pos	It's perfect for the livingroom when my husband and I are sitting and chilling out watching TV.  
__label__neg	When she could support herself better,  she was too tall for it
__label__neu	We may just move to a tub seat when he can sit well enough.
__label__pos	"""It took me less than 5 minutes to set it up."""
__label__neg	talk about time consuming).
__label__pos	This is a very trim diaper when you combine it with a Thirsties or Bummis cover.
__label__neu	I got this warmer as a shower gift.
__label__neg	The colors are muddy compared to the bedding and the vinyl smell is overpowering.
__label__pos	It is especially perfect for those newborn babies.
__label__neg	"""We could not be more disappointed."""
__label__pos	"""This one has the handle which makes it easier for real young ones to grip."""
__label__pos	The fabric is really soft and it comes in so many nice colors.
__label__neu	Munchkin makes two versions of this cart
__label__pos	"""We purchased this swing for our newborn son based on the fact that my wife uses one at the daycare she works at."""
__label__neg	 It's not worth the risk
__label__neg	I do not own this item but I tried it out in the store and it HURT my shoulder
__label__neg	 It's no better than the Nuby, with perhaps the Nuby being a bit better actually- The volume markings on the side of the bottle are near impossible to read
__label__neg	 So disappointed
__label__pos	He never wakes up from being cold.
__label__neu	Maybe our baby was too small but it didn't seem like I was able to get this product tight enough on our newborn.  
__label__neg	 AND it shrunk just the tinest bit so to annoy you because it fits but not quite and you broke your nail trying to get it to touch the bottom of the mattress
__label__neg	That's my only complaint though.
__label__neg	Make sure that you put the lid on the cup and then insert the straw.
__label__neu	Originally I thought I would sterilize my bottles in the dishwasher but someone pointed out to me that that would require running the dishwasher every day.
__label__pos	He loves it!
__label__neg	The last thing is that sometimes when my kid is drinking and the straw part flips out of his mouth some of the liquid goes flying across too
__label__pos	It is worth every penny in my opinion compared to other swings that are on the market that don't have half the option that this one does. 
__label__neg	I wish the one I purchased had a remote, and I also wish that it worked with an adapter, because the battery gets used up real fast.
__label__pos	 Only one is ready for the rubbish, the rest have gone into storage for if we have another baby
__label__pos	She never cared for those teething rings or other teething toys, this was it for us.
__label__neu	It hasn't.
__label__pos	I have never had any complications with it and use it daily, sometimes multiple times.
__label__neu	But then she realized it was fun to stick her fingers in the spout and air hole as well as biting them.
__label__neu	I was wrong. 
__label__pos	My 9 month old son has no problems holding it or sucking out of it.
__label__neu	Do not purchase this item.
__label__pos	It's easy to clean after each session and has less pieces per breast than the Harmony.
__label__neu	I did a side by side comparison of these Gerber organic diapers and the Gerber premium prefold cloth diapers which are also quite popular by purchasing a 6-pack of each, for the same price.I washed them all in a regular load of whites with regular detergent and no fabric softener, and dried them on medium.
__label__neu	"I do find that this pump works better for me when I remove the rubber ""petal"" lining."
__label__pos	The thermometer is also a great addition if your child's bathtub doesn't already have one.
__label__neu	I use it in the big tub and when I am done,  I just rinse it and leave it to dry
__label__neu	Soooo....product is going back.
__label__neg	BUT
__label__neu	*** UPDATE* ** my sons loved this exersaucer until they were 11mos old.
__label__neu	I should mention that the material stuck to the wooden roller that came with the kit and the directions state that if this happens, to use a round tin can.
__label__neg	"""It was so ridiculously frustrating to have to stop pumping all the time to unscrew the pump part off, fish in the milk for the piece, snap the top clip part off to reinsert it in place, fidget with the pump handle to get it back in place, pop the cap on, screw it back on, pump very carefully, and BAM- the piece is sucked back into the bottle; repeat."""
__label__neg	Baby doesn't feel confide.
__label__neu	Now that we are expecting baby #2 I am going to have to buy another diaper pail to replace this one.
__label__neg	Another MUST HAVE I was told. 
__label__neu	"""over the pad its self (which sometimes my nephew sticks to without a oniez on!)"""
__label__neu	This way you can leave the car seat in the car and just pop the baby in this sling to get groceries or go to the Dr
__label__neu	My son has been using this teether since he was about 4 months old. 
__label__neu	) I bought the Sony and retired the Fisher Price and am sleeping better than I have in weeks
__label__neg	It would take up too much space using it in the kitchen sink
__label__neg	With a total of 6 parts per bottle cleaning,  warming and sterilizing are completely inconvenient
__label__neg	 My daughter who's into everything have learned how to open the top and remove all the diapers. 
__label__neu	I think the blade has dulled... Anyway,  I am thoroughly unimpressed and will be returning it.
__label__neu	I too read all the reviews for this item, registered for it, and received it as a gift. 
__label__neg	I am primarily breastfeeding but I thought this would be useful for sterilizing pump parts and the occasional bottles.
__label__pos	In the playtex starter pack,  there are also nipples of different sizes and shapes so your baby can decide whe one she likes
__label__neu	"""I have two so I just wash one and use the other."""
__label__neu	"""We use one for baby wipes and one for anti bacterial hand wipes."""
__label__pos	For a bouncy seat, it does the job. 
__label__pos	This sheet fits my Graco pack n play well and feels soft and cozy against the skin.
__label__neu	Luckily I was able to return it and get back the money I wasted
__label__pos	Good things: Seat is comfortable and safe
__label__neg	"""They are very light, though, so it is easy for him to kick or knock them out of his reach (he is not to mobile yet)."""
__label__neg	 I thought it would be great
__label__pos	"""Thanks Baby Bjorn for making this great product!"""
__label__neu	With it's two modes of operation, we can choose to quick sterilize (6 minutes) or longer (keeps sterile for 24 hrs).
__label__neg	Browns she slept through the night with no wake ups.
__label__neg	LOLMy daughter would have more tantrums wearing it than not. 
__label__neu	I should have researched a bit more
__label__neg	My son is gassy.
__label__pos	The strap holes are a good enough size to fit just about any strap.
__label__neu	We have three SwaddleMe wraps for our new baby (now two months old and growing fast).
__label__neg	It's going back to the store today.
__label__neu	My dad,  who is VERY mechanically inclined and my husband spent half an hour trying to figure out how to even unroll it
__label__neg	I now have a wide variety of bottles and bottle parts, and the Avent bottles sit largely unused because I cannot mix and match the parts.
__label__pos	 No bags to buy and no stupid spinning
__label__neu	It does fit in the kitchen sink though.
__label__pos	Of all the items I received at my baby shower this was the one I was most excited about.
__label__pos	"""She loved to chew on the toys and toss around the cups!"""
__label__pos	I really think these are a great product and certainly worth trying!
__label__neg	Not practical
__label__pos	Snoogle's cover is very snug,  without a hint of stretch.
__label__neu	"I am not that small,  5'6"" and 120lbs... I dont like it.. I ended up getting a Infantino Spft Carrier instead."
__label__pos	I practically hung on it myself with full body weight though and it didn't budge so I do think it is safe.
__label__neg	You might as well glue a foam pool noodle to the crib rail, becuase this thing doesn't stick. 
__label__pos	"""Also the music isnt so loud like the K n P"""
__label__pos	I will never use another bib.
__label__pos	"""that probably means your child is done eating anyhow."""
__label__neu	Well, I have had this set for a several months. 
__label__neg	 It never made it to the changing table
__label__neu	When I just want to rest or read a book it can be folded to prop me up at just the right angle.
__label__pos	 It worked great at first
__label__neg	I plugged it in and waited and waited and waited and the item never ever heated up
__label__pos	We used this for ever bottle feeding.
__label__neu	Granted I have not tried other car seats, maybe they use similar fabric, because of flammability requirements. 
__label__neu	I wanted to use one of these soothers sometimes on the crib but also sometimes in the living room since we spend so much time with the boys in there.
__label__neu	Well,  I am not taking the chance,  so back it goes
__label__neu	We tried it when our daughter was 1-2 months old and no matter which way we had her in the carrier,  she hated it.
__label__pos	This stroller has similar if not the same features as Maclaren Techno only it is $200 cheaper and way better than Maclaren. 
__label__pos	"""This is an investment, but well worth it."""
__label__neu	Sticks out so far you can't fit through standard doorways.
__label__neg	These cups leak like crazy
__label__neg	He can kick his legs out of it in sec
__label__neg	 I guess the music is ok, but we can easily use a CD with better music for those purposes
__label__neu	If you put the bottle/jar in the warmer first and then add the water, the bottle/jar will not float or tip over.  I
__label__neg	I find that I have trouble getting each bottle to the perfect temperature.
__label__neg	I have to say I do not like the inclined to sleep at all.
__label__pos	"""and the baby likes it."""
__label__neg	 This product forces you push the diapers through the opening
__label__pos	I know many people who bought this and not one has complained about it.
__label__pos	VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT!
__label__pos	I definitely recommend this.
__label__neu	"""I suggest just buying 2 to put together, rather than buying extensions."""
__label__pos	My baby loves this carrier.
__label__neu	Not quite an autoclave but usable.
__label__pos	Other than that I love it and so does my baby!
__label__pos	My baby still loves it at 9 months!
__label__neu	Gary Peterson
__label__neu	Just have to make sure it is returned to upright position if baby tips it upside down.
__label__neg	i always have to sleep with two pillows under my head, so this pillow doesn't allow me to because it's so bulky
__label__neu	As he got bigger,  I put the sling into the tub (2nd way of the 4-1 system).
__label__neg	 I think that's why he doesn't like it. 
__label__neu	&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;If your baby has an immune promblem, then this may be great for you, otherwise, skip on this and just buy a nice bottle brush
__label__neu	We will be purchasing the travel warmer because we travel to the inlaws frequently.
__label__neu	My son was 7 lbs 1 oz when he was born and 20 inches long... 
__label__neg	There should be more slides that come with the product or the availability to purchase more slides according to the baby's age. 
__label__neg	 Very disappointed... 
__label__pos	We started out with the Avent bottlesand our baby developed colic for about two weeks- switching to Dr. Brown's bottles really helped.
__label__neu	I bought these before our trip to Disney.  
__label__neg	The refills were a pain to put in and like another reviewer said it twisted when it wanted to
__label__neu	Now that I think about it,  suction cups like this always fall off of our fiberglass shower & glass storm door too,  so I guess I should have known better than to get a suction cup bath toy holder.
__label__neu	You have one or two more pieces to put together over regular bottles.
__label__neu	I had no idea that it was this retractable.
__label__neg	The spray is useless. 
__label__neu	 It keeps the baby aligned properly with your breast. 
__label__pos	I am so pleased!
__label__pos	We love the Svan chair (see my review posted under its listing), and we love this cushion!
__label__pos	Good sizeFits most shopping carts perfectly and provides complete coverage
__label__neg	 I am in the process of trying to find the contact information to complain right to the company
__label__pos	5 stars!
__label__neu	We called Safety 1st and were told that a tiny piece of plastic (part of the plastic that protects the battery when it's in the store0 would break off inside the battery holder. 
__label__pos	The scissors work for nails as well.
__label__pos	This is a gorgeous exotic looking mobile.
__label__neg	 I say don't waste your money
__label__neg	"""My son pulls the connector pieces out all the time and chews on them, which is a bit unsanitary."""
__label__neu	I've used it for one son and kept using the first year monitor I've had for years.
__label__neu	I am a first time mom and loved the baby einstein line
__label__neg	 Also, every time she gets up the insert sticks to her behind and will dump if there is anything in it. 
__label__pos	"""This seat's seated shoulder height is higher than our cheap seat."""
__label__pos	The handheld unit works great throughout the house (3600sqft)although it doesnt work if I go out in the driveway, I bought a cheap $20 one that takes care of that.
__label__neg	She didn't like it very much and acted as if she felt like she was going to fall or something.  
__label__neg	THe color feature isn't that great, but that isn't a big deal for me.
__label__neg	In other words, a total waste of money. 
__label__neg	I was ready to give it a 5 star review until today. 
__label__neg	 After I bought these and followed the detailed washing instructions (three times separately in hot water) I tried them out and leaked right through them
__label__neu	Oh and the unit does need to be cleaned
__label__pos	Other than that it worked out well and served its purpose.
__label__neu	I called the 800 number and a very nice sounding lady told me that that's what happens when you use pacifiers...is this true? 
__label__pos	I absolutely recommend this style for bigger infants, not newborn though.
__label__neu	 if you packed this on a carry-on (on an airplane) you wouldn't have much room for anything else, so it's not meant to be portable. 
__label__pos	"""It has 3 positions, so it was easy to use when he was just starting solids."""
__label__neu	Perhaps there are more temperature shifts in my home that arent in others,  and this has a role... ??
__label__pos	They make swaddling you child so much easier than using a blanket and the material is super soft.
__label__neu	I think the mechanism for squeaking is bouncing the dogs rear end on a table or your hand or something else sort of hard (the bed works sometimes).  
__label__neu	The bag gets emptied daily and there are no smells of diapers in her room.
__label__neu	Pro's*Padded & Comfy*4 Sided-this keeps baby from accidently bumping their head*Easy to wipe clean*Bottom is skid proofCon's*cover gets holes easily. 
__label__neg	The moment we wiped it with a lightly damp cloth,  the grain in the unfinished wood raised up and we had to sand it
__label__neu	 I finally decided to buy another and bought this one. 
__label__neu	The purpose of a baby monitor is to free you up for household chores while still allowing you to know that junior is safe and sound.
__label__neu	We replaced it with THE FIRST YEARS CLEAN AIR DIAPER DISPOSAL SYSTEM.
__label__neg	One squeaker was defective. 
__label__neg	We threaded a towel between the cushion and seat support and let it drag on the floor for the first 4 months to slow it down.
__label__neg	It was impossible to get the whole thing into the carrying case and get it zipped up
__label__neg	Sadly, at 10 months he had gotten too big to wash easily and he can stand up, which is awkard with the shape of the tub. 
__label__neu	The music goes off all the time
__label__pos	My son had excema when he was an infant and the Gerber is the most moisturizing for his skin.
__label__neu	We use this headrest for their bouncy seats only.
__label__neg	 These nipples do NOT fit well in the nipple compartment of this dishwasher basket
__label__pos	This is must have for every baby.
__label__pos	This one of the most useful baby products out there.  
__label__neg	However,  it won't stay on the door.
__label__pos	That alone is priceless!
__label__pos	But it is very easy to wipe off.
__label__neu	I need real measurements.
__label__neg	 I called Playtex about this and they agreed to send me 6 new nipples if I sent them back 8 (?). 
__label__neg	 Now I now why it was barely-used
__label__neu	I got this as a gift at my baby shower and I finally put it together when Price was 2.5 months old.
__label__neg	The bottle brush just simply wouldn't get the bottles clean.
__label__pos	She does enjoy stuffing her other bath toys in it though so we have got some use out of it.
__label__pos	"""This is my 3rd monitor that i have bought, and I LOVED it until yesterday when for some reason it just stopped working ( i have had it right around a year)."""
__label__neu	Sell yours on ebay,  spend ten bucks for a good audio monitor,  and put the rest in baby's college fund where you'll get much more use out of it.
__label__neg	 I can only wash 3 nipples at a time in this basket
__label__neu	The dog can sit outside the room and see in and that cats want nothing to do with it.  
__label__pos	I had heard good things about this product but this is something you HAVE to experience for yourself.
__label__neu	My daughter loves baths & bubbles so we got this...but it came with only a small amount of bubble mix. 
__label__neg	The Brownies are really good too - but just too hard to clean on a regular basis.
__label__neu	About 4 months later at 2 in the morning,  my husband and I were jolted by a loud crash
__label__neg	You can get it much cheaper at your local Target or Walmart, though.
__label__neg	This so-called traveler toilet is not usable
__label__neg	 on a good day
__label__neg	 I wouldn't buy it again
__label__neg	You could also see them under my clothes.
__label__neu	Before I started to use these I'd get to wash the changing pad cover after each time my husband gets to change our son when he pooped, not to mention the clothes of both my baby AND my husband.
__label__pos	Highly recommend
__label__pos	It has a good rubber grip, adjustable length, sturdy design and material.  
__label__neu	Wanted to use the Avent line,  but baby just wouldn't take this nipple.
__label__pos	They would finish a bottle in about 1/2 the time and no more caving in nipples or leaks.
__label__pos	The pluses: it is small, it does work OK sometimes. 
__label__neg	There is no good way to warm with a bottle warmer
__label__pos	It has a cute little fish theme.  
__label__neu	I researched and researched forward facing car seats.
__label__neu	It was rocky the first 2 days but afterward smoothe sailing!
__label__neu	I leave the Kiddopotamus on her crib in the open position and if she falls asleep unswaddled I wrap her up in three easy steps.
__label__neu	Wash your bottles and put them in this sterilizer. 
__label__neg	 Poor quality
__label__pos	the best feature is the sling.
__label__neg	The nail clippers,hairbrush, and comb are great but I did not care for the rest
__label__neg	 There is the other type of car seat where there is a strap at the bottom where you can simply just pull to tighten
__label__pos	What's not to love?UPDATE: Ok, still using after ten or so months and my one complaint is that the bottom rack sits too flush to the base, meaning mold tends to build underneath where the water is trapped.
__label__neu	I could not get a straight yes or no answer from Kids II who actually manufacture this product.
__label__pos	I also like the weight and music of this toy - it also worked well for us in a long car ride (at night) to add some light and color display :)
__label__neu	We have it tucked away for whenever we decide to give our son a sibling. 
__label__neu	This pump is HORRIBLE.
__label__neu	I feel like I'm constantly emptying it,  which isn't the simplest procedure.
__label__neg	it never folded back up to the size it was in the box
__label__pos	"""It was a horrible experience getting him used to the Avent nipple, but once he did it was smooth sailing like I mentioned above."""
__label__neg	First they said no return. 
__label__neg	They leak like mad
__label__neu	don't waste your money buying something more expensive.
__label__pos	You won't regret it!
__label__pos	"""Plus, after my daughter has outgrown the need for cabinet locks I can put them in their inactive mode."""
__label__neu	The instructions say to assemble the pump while wet to improve the seal on the cushion and &quot;diaphram&quot;,  but that still didn't help.
__label__neg	I changed the batteries for the second time and they ran out after ONE use!
__label__neu	The little mouth part has been used to throw at the dogs, which isn't great, but at least it is soft and light!
__label__neg	 The differences, for 10$, are pronounced
__label__neu	So, when I pull out the cover to use the vacuum, I can clip the cover to the cord.
__label__neu	I recommend finding an ink pad just for ease of use
__label__neu	"""I have a 2 month old and I was producing more more milk than he was drinking allowing me to store some in the freezer."""
__label__neu	On the regular Diaper Genie II,  you have to push the diaper through the hole
__label__pos	But this toy had him in stitches.  
__label__pos	I've started using the maya wrap more, because it's easier and cooler, but it's not as versatile.
__label__neu	I think he may be too young for it, but it rests on his knees & seems to really bug him.
__label__pos	Any time we have a sitter we make sure they use this as well.It is SO easy and SO great to use.
__label__neu	I bought this at babies r us.
__label__neu	And the auquarium print on it is gender neutral.
__label__pos	Haba toys are well-made, and this is no exception. 
__label__neu	I purchased this product for much cheaper from diapers.com.
__label__neg	I did not find this item to be very comfortable at all! 
__label__neg	"""Try again Serta."""
__label__neu	It's already leukewarm. 
__label__pos	My daughter is almost 5 months and has been playing in this gym for a few months now.
__label__neu	My daughter didn't seem to have the gas and colic that other reviews talk about, but we did use quite a bit of gas medicine between 3 and 6 months
__label__neu	We got our gate about 5 years ago. 
__label__pos	i love that you can use this product for a few years rather than a few months.
__label__neg	These pads are terrible.
__label__pos	My son LOVES this carrier, at least facing forward (He wasn't keen on facing inward in any of the carriers).
__label__pos	The other feature I would like to point out is that it is lightweight to carry. 
__label__neg	And there you are,  wasted milk,  and a hungry baby who is drenched,  and really mad by the time you get another bottle ready and her clothes changed
__label__pos	The kneeling stool is great. 
__label__neg	It does not stay securely in place and is constantly moving so that baby is either out of view or it completely falls back flat.
__label__pos	Everyday for months I put this thing in the bathroom in front of our wall mirror, my son loved it.
__label__neg	"It also sounds like you're breaking it because it has ""teeth"" on each hinge that pop into place in small increments (each increment makes a clicking sound)."
__label__neg	The procedure to unseal and reseal the bag to get out the bottles is straightforward,  although probably not necessary.
__label__neu	She is now 10 months and walking!
__label__neu	You really won't need it,  but if you are so worried about the smell,  you can buy the Glad Oder Shield bags
__label__pos	"""My husband doesn't mind carrying this bag..."""
__label__pos	I like it because it is electric.
__label__pos	OTHER THAN THAT A MUST HAVE PRODUCT.
__label__pos	"""Others we've tried claim to have a soft spout, but they don't compare to this one."""
__label__neg	These really are terrible sheets. 
__label__neg	They usually have such great quality products.
__label__pos	If I had to return all my gifts and keep one, this is the one I would keep.
__label__pos	I did really like it at first though.
__label__pos	We love this chair (we also had the infant package)We received it as a gift and have used it since our daughter was 5 months old she will be 2 in 2 weeks it is the perfect size for her and our room.
__label__neu	I finally gave up on it when she was 4 weeks old and got the sound and lights with dual receivers
__label__pos	So easy! 
__label__neu	If your child isn't grabbing,  or even if they are but not at the fish,  you have to do it for them if you want the lights
__label__neg	I registered for this tub when my 10 month old was born because I thought the shower feature would be very handy
__label__neg	Then I tried gorilla glue.
__label__pos	 I ended up getting the Skip Hop Drying Rack, and it is working very well for me
__label__pos	"""I just travelled alone with baby by plane across country and fit everything we both needed in this bag."""
__label__pos	"This keeps us from having to twist around from the front & try to retrieve the ""lost"" items. :)"
__label__neu	 When I returned the larger ones to Babies R US there were a lot of other returns as well
__label__neu	Otherwise, it keeps all the nasty smells inside the bin.
__label__pos	"""I looked at another step stool in the BRU store when I bought this, and its rubber already looked icky just from people testing it out."""
__label__neu	Bath time is still a trying time for us, but at least I knwo that she is safe in the tub.  
__label__pos	That's worth the price in itself!
__label__neg	These locks did not install quickly, my husband had a difficult time aligning the separate pieces in a way that allowed the magnets to operate properly.
__label__pos	They are the only worthwhile bottles on the market and are well worth the extra price as well as the extra time to wash.
__label__pos	It saves time and space (very compact and flat when folded up) and is holding up great.
__label__neu	We started using this when we came home from the hsopital.
__label__neg	I thought these were the answer based on all the great reviews they got on this site.
__label__pos	I Stopped using it and purchased the Cuisinart baby food maker and it is awesome!!
__label__neu	"""I've always been afraid that even gentle brushing with the bristle brush would tear the slit (the silicone is very thin here)."""
__label__pos	I like that she can hold onto it herself and I don't have to worry about her choking (there's no way she could fit anything but the tip of the mesh in her mouth).
__label__pos	The benefits are worth far more than the cost.
__label__neg	 I don't think the harness has been designed well
__label__neg	 I returned it the next day
__label__pos	I love it as well!
__label__pos	Grumpy Babies: Resistance is futile!
__label__pos	Very pleased!
__label__pos	I am really impressed with this one!
__label__pos	Pros:After figuring out how to pump properly, I started getting more milk. 
__label__neg	Munchkin's version is much better.
__label__neg	The problem is, it leaks! 
__label__neu	I bought these for my son for his infant carrier.
__label__neg	13 pounds & was 24 1/2 inches, she probably would be falling out of it by now
__label__neu	When you go out to eat - you have enough stuff to carry with you so the jares were just fine
__label__neg	"""SAVE YOUR MONEY AND JUST USE THE MICROWAVE."""
__label__neg	 It yellowed, pulled off, and stripped the paint off the crib too
__label__neg	I wish I had done more research before buying this item.
__label__neg	 We tried quite alot to get him too, but in the end waste of money
__label__neu	"""I recommend practicing putting baby in & taking her out before actually going out with it for the first time."""
__label__neg	"""We also purchased the bib which is a life saver because of all the drooling she does."""
__label__pos	I'm really glad I didn't waste my money on one of the more expensive ones
__label__neu	We decided we had to have something so we started researching.
__label__neg	 This thing is WAY too much work for a diaper pail
__label__neg	"This is the second time I've ordered ""The First Years"" cups and gotten a cheap knockoff ""Learning Curve"
__label__neg	 If you get too much milk in the bag, it will leak when you close it up. 
__label__pos	My daughter is two months old and I just discovered these great bottles. 
__label__neg	We used a nice pad cover too.*the seams are coming apart-this is the top of the pad so if baby pee's it could go into the holes and would be impossible to get cleaned out. 
__label__neu	Forcing the nipple off the bottle breaks the sealing mechanism and renders the bottle useless.
__label__neg	 What a waste
__label__neu	As one other reviewer noted, the iQ24 does not clean the bottles!
__label__pos	I never leaked much, so these pads worked fine in that respect.
__label__neu	Save your money on this one.
__label__neu	After sterilizing it, I just leave it in the sterilizer.
__label__neg	It goes with the rest of the Windsor products I have, but here are my complaints about the swing.
__label__neg	 You could find something much better for around the same cost.
__label__neu	I've contacted Sony,  and the replacement battery is almost as expensive (after shipping) as just buying a new monitor.
__label__pos	Another plus is that it's nice looking and blends in with the rest of the bathroom.
__label__neu	"""I bought this glider in the espresso/beige for my son's nursery."""
__label__pos	"""He sleeps with it, takes it to daycare, and had to have it during a short stay in the hospital."""
__label__neg	 There are times when she doesn't go and the music goes off which is confusing. 
__label__neg	It's not too great.
__label__neg	As mentioned from quite a few other people,  it is very difficult to remove a baby w/o hitting their head
__label__pos	I really love the Ergo's design - it's easy to use, sturdy, and the pull-up hood is a fantastic feature.  
__label__neu	Overall,  she never grew to like it and we returned it.
__label__neg	So I stopped using it right away.
__label__neu	(Okay slight exaggeration  But it was HUGE.
__label__neu	Before I had my baby, I didn't think that I would need this item. 
__label__pos	Very durable and practical.
__label__neg	I used this item 3 times, now its collecting dust
__label__pos	I like it because everything is detchable and I sometimes take the birdies and attach them to her car seat.
__label__neu	What a peace of junk!!!
__label__pos	You're little one will get SOOOO much use out of this! 
__label__neg	This was not usable at all for me with my newborn.
__label__neg	 my twins can't relax enough to 'go' while sitting on it because the hinges are flimsy so the seat feels like it's about to give way under them
__label__pos	Great new bathtub!
__label__neu	I have not used any other diaper pails so I am no expert on this.
__label__neg	 There was no rhyme or reason to it, we had it set the same way every time
__label__pos	I like the items this kit contains.
__label__neu	And the screen is bigger than some others.  
__label__neu	"""He is 22 months and just started potty training, but he didn't have any success with the hard plastic seat."""
__label__pos	I also love that it can be a tummy time mat.  
__label__neu	Great product overall, BUT...
__label__neg	 Maybe he just doesn't get it
__label__neg	I wish I would have purchased something else.
__label__pos	The first time he smiled and laughed was when he was on the mat. 
__label__neg	It is extremely light, just like any cheap plastic baby plate. 
__label__pos	He sleeps like a champ whenever he's in it
__label__pos	Absolutely adorable!
__label__neg	"""I would want this to have a timer so that it would turn off if I dozed off..."""
__label__neg	"""however it is not smell proof."""
__label__pos	the best product ever invented
__label__pos	 I loved the idea that it folded up, had a carrying strap, could come apart easily to clean, and the different trays. 
__label__neg	Now having used these for nearly 5 months - they are falling apart!
__label__neu	I wish I had never used these on my baby.... he had major skin problem on his scalp after using this.
__label__neu	The Diaper Champ must be great for infants but you may want to consider something else for older babies!
__label__neu	the edge of shield is firm. 
__label__pos	"""Very sturdy and safe gate."""
__label__neu	I have a bottle but haven't tried it yet.2. 
__label__neu	We finally just opted for cleaning wipes in her bag
__label__neu	I plan on returning mine and getting the one that I really wanted but didn't want to spend the extra money on,  I will know better next time.
__label__pos	Calming and Soothing!
__label__pos	We love and own many of their other items.
__label__neg	I tried just using the strap, but that is supposed to go around the headrest, and there is no headrest for the center of the backseat, just the right and left sides. 
__label__neu	We switched to the Platex NaturalLatch and now she takes a bottle.
__label__neu	The set is made of fabrics with different textures.
__label__neu	A place to sit!
__label__pos	"""When you pour one section of formula out into the bottle you sometimes get a tiny bit of powder from another compartment, but largely I have not had trouble."""
__label__neu	We're a big fan of Sony's electronics,  so we figured we'd be just as satisfied with the monitor.
__label__neg	Now there are MANY better and much cheaper options
__label__pos	It really cuts down on the amount of time it takes to make my baby's bottles now because I can pump directly into her bottles.
__label__neg	My husband and others in the family have had this problem.
__label__pos	As one reviewer notes, there are a number of steps involved, but they're easy to learn, become second nature, and most importantly they *work*. 
__label__neg	 IE you can not change the battery
__label__neg	This monitor kept us from sleeping and we had to go exchange it.  
__label__pos	"""it is very easy to install with either seatbelt or LATCH (depending on your car)."""
__label__neg	 One has static and the other is the worst sound you will ever hear
__label__neu	Use a conventional warm wash cloth
__label__neg	We have an elongated toilet and I don't know of anyway to hold this seat in place.
__label__neu	Now after a month and a half he's a little bored by it (probably because we've played with it several times a day) so I may put it away for a little while but I'm sure he'll continue to enjoy it later.
__label__neg	"""And I wondered if the bunched material under his butt and back hurt him."""
__label__neu	We've had ours for a few years now and it has taken a beating.
__label__pos	"""spend less, buy these now instead of the cheapo kind."""
__label__neu	I attribute this to these bottles. 
__label__pos	At 6 months they still remained a favorite because they were the perfect teething toy.
__label__pos	We are thinking about buying the ladybug now.
__label__pos	She loves the music so dances and jumps up and down.
__label__pos	 The video actually works really well and aside for some NOISY interference that it picks up sometimes, its a great picture day or night
__label__neu	ask me
__label__pos	The folding locks take a bit of getting used to, but they work well.
__label__pos	It truly holds as many diapers ODOR free as they say it does.  
__label__neu	I really wanted to like this.
__label__pos	It has great suction power and adjustable suction speeds, which makes all the difference.
__label__neg	It has 150 coils which is supposed to be sufficient but I wish I had looked for more than 200 coils
__label__pos	The movement of the litle animals is rythmic and allows children to follow what is happening.
__label__neg	 If my head is comfortable the bottom does not hook well between my legs, if it hooks well between my legs it it like I am being strangled
__label__pos	So far this has been a great product. 
__label__pos	All was well for a couple of months.
__label__neu	It is a little difficult for her to put her feet through the footholes by herself after they are tucked in
__label__neg	"But most importantly I don't like the fact that with all the positions except the nursing one,  my baby would have to have his legs crunched up in the ""frog"" position - he hates his legs being confined like that"
__label__pos	The cloth diapers are great as burp clothes or anything else you need to use them for to soak up wet stuff.  
__label__neg	Cons:It's quite heavy and sometimes a pain to move from the regular spot that I keep it. 
__label__pos	It is worth the money and from all the other reviews it seems to last a very long time
__label__pos	However I have since bought some and the markers on them are blue making it much easier to read the ounces you are making.
__label__pos	Fit right onto the Avent pump
__label__neu	5 inches high and the short side of the guard is 2.
__label__neu	The sterilizer was given to me as a shower gift.
__label__neg	This doesn't do well for a toddler... 
__label__neg	I am very disappointed.
__label__neg	It was nearly worthless after the first washing because of how much it shrank.
__label__neu	 I highly recommend the Sony babycall monitor (also carried by Babies R Us, but not online)
__label__neg	Can fit but water keep leaking out fr the rubber ring.. 
__label__pos	This tub is incredible for a newborn. 
__label__neg	Most times my husband or I had to head off to the restroom to try to get it clean enough to take home
__label__neu	"""but really, what would the alternative be..."""
__label__neg	"""Save your money and go to a local Walmart and get the bottle warmer by Parents choice."""
__label__neu	And it takes up so much space.... Don't recommend this at all... especially for the price.
__label__neu	It is very small and the sling is awkward and does not hold the baby securely enough.
__label__neg	First,  the two side holders could not fold out without squishing her in.(And she is small for her age)
__label__neu	Amazon should correct this as it seems like they are trying to con their customers into buying the same exact thing in lesser quantity but for more money.
__label__pos	but the third one was a charm
__label__neu	I have now bought the 8 ounce bottles and use them also.
__label__neu	When I 1st had it with my 1st boy, I was scared to use it for breast-feeding.
__label__pos	 I gave this product more time and sure enough, my baby is addicted. 
__label__pos	But the main dish I like this because it is very useful to keep veggies and fruits separate when feeding my baby.
__label__neg	Do not bother with this item, try Ikea for a space saving solution that is of better quality
__label__neu	 She is now 9
__label__neg	The only problem that I have was that by buying by Amazon, I had no access to technical service and warranty in Venezuela because here only covers the devices purchased in the country
__label__pos	"""I would definately recommend this carrier, it is expensive but for us its been a great investment."""
__label__neg	It is definitely not enough to last through the whole night.
__label__neu	As a last attempt,  I took the bag off,  and miracle of miracles
__label__neu	I initially had mine about 6 ft away from baby so my husband grabbed the wipe and passed it to me while I was changing my son
__label__neg	Not to mention its bulkyness.We returned it and bought Nursery and Bath Care Set by Summer Infant Products.
__label__pos	I have never had them crack or break.
__label__neg	 I do not recommend
__label__neg	Since the chair was facing the dining table,  she ended up busting her lip right on the edge of the glass table
__label__pos	I know, that's awfully old to be swaddled, but she has severe eczema and during a flare-up, these are wonderful at keeping her hands restricted (at least for a while) and calming her down.
__label__pos	I am only expressing twice a day so it is easy to clean!
__label__pos	I love the Windsor pattern, so I figured I would register for all of the items in Windsor print.
__label__neu	I filled the bath with very hot water to clean it out and the plug slowly changed color.
__label__pos	I really love this cover for my BabyBjorn carrier. 
__label__neu	I purchased this to use in my daughter's crib over-night since she seems to leak through her diaper and pajamas no matter what and I was getting very tired of changing sheets every morning.
__label__pos	We're looking forward to using the aquarium high chair later on as well.
__label__neu	I have seen him use the top part as a bench to play his Fisher-Price piano.
__label__neg	 :) We ended up getting a more unisex looking model that both of us liked
__label__neu	As a matter of fact if you tighten too much the lid actually clicks through and opens back up.
__label__neu	I bought this cover because it was the only brand offered at Babies R Us.
__label__pos	 The bag replacement system is well designed and easy to replace
__label__pos	It is very comfortable, easy to put on, & I feel like the baby is secure, all the while I can manage my toddler easily! 
__label__neu	The #2 stage nipple took her only 15 minutes but she had horrible gas pains after she was done even though she was burped several times during feeding.
__label__pos	"""get this one, its worth every penny!"""
__label__pos	Bottom line is that it doesn't look much different than the others like it at the store which are upwards of $80-100 and this does the job just as well
__label__pos	"""I would leave it there, but my husband uses it if she gets hungry and Im not home from work yet."""
__label__neg	I used it alone in the kitchen sink.
__label__neu	He would watch us do housework or sleep...  
__label__neg	Buttons require too much strength to push for a 6 month old. 
__label__neg	The clip also slips and does not hold on tightly to the bar, and the velcro is not secure enough to rely on alone.We also thought it would be good to hang on our pack n' play, but it is too heavy to clip on anything.
__label__pos	My children love it.
__label__neu	Oh well, we  make do and I just make sure her bottom is at least on the pad. 
__label__pos	"""I recommend this pump to anyone who plans on nursing - short term or long term."""
__label__neg	The only problem for us was that our son really didn't like it at all.
__label__neu	It is easier for my son to hold the Dr. Brown's bottles also.
__label__neg	 Everytime you flip the lid it pushes this horrible smell into the room
__label__pos	Also very easy to put up and take down. 
__label__pos	"""I will be buying the Bundle Me Big once our baby outgrows this one."""
__label__neg	Apparently the walls in the play pen are made from a very rough netting and scrubbed the skin off my babies toes
__label__pos	We can't express how much we LOVE the Dr. Brown's bottles.
__label__neg	As other people said it would collapse easily
__label__pos	"""This swing has been a lifesaver, and I LOVE the cradle or swing option, which is great for parents whose babies may like only one or the other (this prevents parents from having to buy a second swing if baby doesn't like the way the first one rocks)."""
__label__neu	I
__label__neg	 and did i mention it leaks and wasted my milk. 
__label__neg	I bought this one in pink-lavender stripes and found that it's impossible to use it correctly and very uncomfortable for the child in it (the whole body and especially the neck).
__label__neu	There are no little places for bacteria to collect.
__label__neu	This was one of the first things I purchased because I had read everyone's reviews and everyone seemed to love it and called it a
__label__neu	We all know you aren't supposed to microwave bottles either,  so you are left with the only other option,  placing the bottle in boiling water to warm
__label__neg	IF you tighten the bottom too much, the baby can't get any milk. 
__label__neu	I only pump occasionally so I don't know about using it for expressing many bottles.
__label__pos	You can buy one almost just like it from Huggies full of wipes for about $3.
__label__neg	 Frankly, there are just too many parts that have to be assembled and taken apart
__label__neg	I do hand wash mine even though they state top-rack dishwasher safe and I believe that helps them last a little longer.
__label__neu	After finally figuring out to replace them (takes a bit of a trick to get the battery compartment back in its slot)the Duracell batteries died again in another two weeks.
__label__neu	Between feedings just wash with little soap and warm/hot water then I keep it in a sealed bowl near my bed for feedings.  
__label__pos	The colors are bright and fun for baby to look at.
__label__pos	It's comfy and it works great for infants with reflux.
__label__pos	"""(btw, the disposable table toppers are also great for traveling.)"""
__label__neu	i would not buy this item if i where you.
__label__neu	My son was having a hard time sleeping when we brought him home from the hospital
__label__neu	I had this seat for about 2.5 years. 
__label__neg	I returned it the next day - just not worth it.  
__label__neg	The bigger downside though is that I have it attached for the middle seat in my mid- sized sedan and as a couple other reviewers point out it completely blocks the visibility of the car behind you.
__label__neu	 Save your money
__label__neu	I tried both the stage one and two.
__label__neu	My main complaints are that the music and vibration turn off and it is too short.
__label__pos	Fantastic!
__label__neu	Unless you lift and place your son on it
__label__neu	I was so unhappy that I returned the product.
__label__neu	I didn't realize that he was unhappy with these bottles until I changed,  but I see a big difference now.
__label__neg	 I went out and bought a sponge thing for my son to sit on
__label__neg	 Actually, it's not OK
__label__pos	it's also quite quiet.highly recommended.
__label__neg	I had nothing but problems trying to keep it from falling apart while my daughter played with it...and yes, it was put together properly. 
__label__pos	- won't topple over.REGULAR GARBAGE BAGSOne hand use.
__label__neg	Milk seems to pour out our newborns mouth (3 mos now).
__label__neg	 IT was TOO tight around his stomach that he spit up in teh back of our SUV
__label__neu	I tried replacing these batteries too,  to no avail.
__label__neu	We have a round crib rail,  so the normal guard would not have worked
__label__pos	"""In his Britax he almost never complains and just looks so comfortable."""
__label__neg	 He would leak milk everywhere or squirt it at us, it was very messy. 
__label__neu	I wish I'd just gone straight to this one.I really agonized about whether to spend the money on this one or go with a cheaper one.
__label__neu	It was just too hard for me to try to remember the 3 steps it took to open them,  let alone asking all those other people to do it
__label__pos	It was comfortable for both me and the baby. 
__label__pos	Plus you can use them during travel at the office.
__label__neg	The mesh seat wicks the water all over, so she was sitting in a very wet chair.
__label__neu	So I just throw a package of refills in it and use it just like that with no warming.
__label__pos	Folds up very compactly.
__label__pos	That was useful to me as a soon-to-be first time Mom
__label__pos	The ablility to stack these is fantastic.
__label__neg	even though he'll put almost anything else in his mouth)  he's used to eating real food so he's probably not willing to put up with the thick netting to get to the real food
__label__neu	For my previous babies I had the First Years Sure Comfort newborn to toddler tub.
__label__pos	"I am glad to have this ""luxury"" for my baby."
__label__pos	So far I am not disappointed.
__label__neu	well, he can throw the ball, we're still working on the catching.
__label__neg	The squeaker is hard to activate with your hand, especially in contrast to other Lamaze toys like the firefly and bug.  
__label__neu	I returned this wipe warmer to the store when I realized that it uses a wall wart rather than a standard electrical plug.
__label__pos	"""They're clear so can't tell they're on."""
__label__neu	If you buy a newborn tub, you will be buying this one shortly thereafter because your newborn will outgrow the small one so quickly.  
__label__neg	"""The only complaint--the music plays and the mobile turns for only about 7 minutes, and then you have to hit the reset button."""
__label__neu	Please,  please,  please - invest in another one and if you own it check the integrity.
__label__pos	My only regret is not having bought this right away when we started formula.
__label__pos	The diaper dekor does not allow any odor to stink up my daughter's room.
__label__neu	I use these wipes for cleaning my son in the morning.
__label__neg	I thought I would be saving money by purchasing a Snugli instead of a Baby Bjorn!
__label__pos	"""Great product!"""
__label__pos	"""You can see in the pic what I mean, other than that it is great."""
__label__pos	"""And, when she is done with one breast and doesn't want the other, I am able to empty it in less than 10 minutes (sometimes even just 5 minutes!)."""
__label__neu	It actually spans the distance from the top of the seat to the roof of the car splitting the rear window visibility in half.
__label__neu	I put it on the floor under his bassinet then on a short stool next to his crib. 
__label__neu	You have to keep pressing the play button after each song.
__label__neu	Save your money and purchase the first years tub!
__label__neu	This makes it impossible to either install the unit,  or to remove it!!!  Whoever designed the crib attachment battery pack part of this product should be fired Donald Trump style!!!  Back to the drawing board Fisher-Price.
__label__neg	I received this as a gift and was thrilled that it came with two monitors (a real plus), but cannot stand how much noise it makes
__label__neg	The lid also kept coming off of mine
__label__pos	Being able to put her down every once in a while is wonderful since she seems to have an issue with gas and possible reflux.  
__label__pos	My little one loves it and even knows how to empty it!  
__label__pos	The changing pad is a great size.
__label__pos	I love the colors and patterns and the crinkle ears.  
__label__pos	"""It has never fallen off the wall!"""
__label__pos	I've found them useful in the kitchen and master bath - and other rooms where the kids are allowed only under a watchful eye.
__label__pos	They are soft, pliable and easy to use.
__label__neg	The down- side to this product is if you do keep the little speaker tucked in and closed up inside the bear it's a pain in the butt to turn the device on-- it's not easy to get to the on button.
__label__pos	"""They are not soft like other covers but they do the job they are supposed to do and fit my tall sided changing pad, which I love."""
__label__neu	When he was a bit older he'd yell into them or bang the cups together.
__label__pos	It is also good to help them sit up later.
__label__neu	It has a plug on the right had side to help it drain.  
__label__neg	I hate evenflo products but went against my better judgement anyway. 
__label__neg	 My nipples were too flat, so I just ended up with wet, smelly breasts. 
__label__pos	It doesn't take up a lot of space and is super easy to travel with, the detachable play tray is awesome and my little one loves it.
__label__neg	 It has no holes for the safety straps on the pad to fit through. 
__label__neu	I have them filled with diapers, receiving blankets, bibs, burp cloths, bath supplies, etc.  
__label__pos	getting rid of the engorgement and pumping out most of the milk
__label__neg	"""All in all-not a good design at all."""
__label__pos	And, in my opinion, it's an exceptional toy that will keep most children entertained which, in and of itself, is a blessing.
__label__neu	 I felt it was too dangerous
__label__neg	My baby doesn't like pacifiers at all so I was skeptical about this.
__label__neu	But if you are not a good swaddler they will break free of it,  I know because she would break out when my husband wrapped her but not when I did.
__label__pos	Very versatile. 
__label__pos	Our 2 and 3/4 year old son is only about 22-23 pounds and still sits there.
__label__neg	Well I somehow ended up getting the Isis manual Breast Pump in the mail for free & the only thing I can say is that I'm glad I didn't shell out money for this pump!
__label__pos	The best part is that if you make a mistake or you are not happy with how the print came out you can redo it.
__label__pos	I have lots of breastfeeding problems like clogged ducts,  regular engorgement,  and milk blisters and this has saved me hours of pain many times when the baby wouldn't nurse and a hand pump wouldn't do the trick
__label__neg	A toddler who tends to chew things would quickly end up with a rough rail that snags his clothes and scrapes his skin,  and the unfinished rail is impossible to clean if a kid throws up on it
__label__neg	 He is almost 11 months old so hopefully he will do better with them when he is older (fortunately I only bought the 20 pack)
__label__neg	It also doesn't hold the Playtex Drop-Ins bottles like I hoped it would.
__label__neg	The problem with it is the motor simply cannot keep up
__label__pos	He was laughing and laughing and that's why I just had to go out and buy one for him.
__label__neg	 I decided to swaddle her the old fashion way in a flannel blanket then wrap her with this on cold nights
__label__neu	We received this gift for our son and have used it since he was born.
__label__neg	 First of all it is loud
__label__neg	One of the drawers won't close unless I press hard on the direct spot where the lock is located.
__label__neg	 I leaked through the entire 6 pack in about 12 hours
__label__neu	It lasts about a week with 5 hours of naps a day
__label__neu	"""I have several of these - one under the sheet on the crib and one under the sheet to my pack and play."""
__label__neu	I love the sling but I am tempted to beat the tub with a hammer just to take out my frustrations with it.
__label__pos	"""You don't always want your kid gnawing on plastic and this is a good alternative."""
__label__neu	If the pillow worked properly,  it would have been worth it.
__label__neg	 Finally, after two months of dealing with this pail, one morning, I flipped the handle, and the cylinder fell right into the bottom of the pail
__label__neg	 They leak badly may be because a lot of water bottles were changed for the past year or so
__label__pos	I LOVE that I can just throw these in the wash instead of having to take off the whole cover.
__label__neg	Regular adult stuff is more useful and better quality
__label__neu	I bought this when our son was 2 1/2 months old.
__label__neu	It takes so much less time,  and all you have to do is shake the bottle really well to eliminate hotspots.
__label__neg	I highly doubt it's going to last longer than crib use
__label__pos	It's SO MUCH EASIER than using the restaurant booster.
__label__pos	THE BUNDLE ME IS BEST
__label__neu	Once our baby was big enough to sit up, we put her on the other end (toddler end), and she plays and splashes, while still having the plastic molding so she can't slip back into the water.
__label__neu	I even use them myself when we are in a restroom that doesn't supply the paper ones. 
__label__neg	I was disappointed. 
__label__pos	"""keeps me from being sore!"""
__label__pos	I never pump now since I'm home with my baby, but I am so glad I have this pump.
__label__neu	"""However, there are two reasons for the four stars:(1) The cow is facing the parents and not the baby."""
__label__neu	I think for the money it's a good choice, but overall I think Maclaren wins for umbrella strollers (if you have the extra money to put out for one).
__label__neu	She pulls on them and rubs them to make sounds.
__label__pos	If you choose to get one, this wipe warmer is great!
__label__pos	Good while it worked
__label__neg	You have to straighten them out each time you put a child in the seat.
__label__neg	For some reason my baby cannot figure this cup out
__label__neu	infant, original and toddler.
__label__neg	 This product is poorly constructed and screw holes are not even the right size for the included pieces
__label__neu	We would prop them up in bobby pillows and put the mat in between them and they liked leaning over to feel the mat.
__label__pos	With a blob of paint in each compartment, and with relatively no slipping (the children know better than to pick them up, but could if they wanted to) these are great for little ones who are into painting. 
__label__neu	It's a lot faster and easier than trying to mess with the Genie.
__label__neg	...in medical bills!
__label__pos	I truly cannot say enough great things about this sling
__label__pos	I went and bought the linkadoos take along swing, which I love and am completely satisfied with.
__label__neu	The problem we have now is that I am about to start back at work I have realized no one will be as patient with her in daycare as I am with her taking 1 hour to feed her when they have 3 other kids.
__label__neg	it doesnt fit the breast. 
__label__neg	 What would seem to be a very easy toy to put together cost me over an hour of wasted time. 
__label__pos	Determined breastfeeding mom's these are fantastic until your milk supply comes in at a steady pace.
__label__neu	I think you would be better off with one of those small boppy like pillows they make for this same purpose and just put it under their chin when they fall asleep.
__label__neg	It is like it doesn't fit properly
__label__pos	"""It's ready in less than 4 minutes (we allow for it to cool a bit before taking it out)."""
__label__neu	It grinds very soft foods well like previously frozen fruits and veges and bananas but when trying to grind things like steamed zucchini,  it is very difficult to push down and grind at the same time.
__label__pos	"""I can't be more passionate about this tub."""
__label__neu	BUt having our girl in the next door room does not justify having the monitor.
__label__pos	It cannot get any easier than this.
__label__neg	My daughter has trouble sitting back far enough because when she tries to scoot back, the whole seat goes with her.
__label__pos	This is the best.
__label__pos	Also these plates are very modern and clean looking and will give your rooms a nice mini- makeover especially if you've painted recently and have old outlet plates.
__label__neu	She was 3 months old when Sophie arrived at our house. 
__label__pos	I must admit, this is the third one of these swings that we have had
__label__neg	Well,  if the baby grabs it and shakes it at all,  the rail comes right down
__label__neg	It was way to difficult to clean. 
__label__neg	I'm confused.
__label__pos	Great Mobile
__label__neg	I'm average weight and height,  but this carrier was very painful
__label__neu	It uses less water, her head is elevated, and she's a little higher.
__label__pos	"""The tray slides in and out easily to get the baby out."""
__label__neu	I don't think you can totally avoid all smells,  especially after they start eatting real foods and having more solid poops
__label__neg	This nurser shrunk like a shrinky-dink!
__label__neg	I was worried that she wouldn't take the new bottles well because they were a different size and shape but she didn't hesitate at all.
__label__neg	However I do not recommend it,  because after 6 month of use,  the rubber part  on top is coming off,  making it impossible to use
__label__neu	5 months (2 months later) and teething,  puts everything in his mouth and sucks on everything.
__label__pos	I dont care for the traditional walker either ( I also have carpet so they don't really work anyway).
__label__pos	"""It seems very safe and cozy, and everywhere I go other Moms ask me where I got it."""
__label__pos	"""This one is MUCH more comfortable than the ring sling."""
__label__neu	Baby Bjorn was the pioneer for baby carriers 10 years ago but since then there has been an explosion in the market - slings,  front carriers,  pouches,  etc.
__label__neu	I know there is a picture
__label__pos	He loves to explore all of the different textures and shapes fun to throw and when he's done I can just put it on my wrist (it's big but easy to take along).
__label__neu	But I don't know if it would be as helpful for a taller person.
__label__neu	that thing is not going anywhere
__label__pos	But what they are good for is helping a child who is learning to self-feed master spoon-related skill without having to worry about the bowl moving around.  
__label__neg	I was really excited to use this item since my son was born in December but it was so diffuclt to figure out how it fits on to the car seat I just gave up and returned it.
__label__pos	Plus, the fabric is so lightweight (but not sheer) and BREATHABLE (perfect for hot, humid weather).
__label__pos	It's such a good deal for the money.
__label__neu	but just returned them today.
__label__neg	Perhaps it's because we live in a high traffic area, but we have nothing but static using this monitor. 
__label__neu	I bought this for my Quinny Zappy stroller because it doesn't have any accessories that come with it
__label__pos	She had enjoyed each toy so far!
__label__pos	My son loves his bouncer.
__label__neg	I wrote an earlier review giving this warmer 5 stars because it heated the bottles so fast and the cooler portion made it easy to use anywhere in the house and travel.
__label__neg	"""It is pretty silly."""
__label__neu	It actually kept a more consistent pace before I put the batteries in and just pushed the seat with my son in it
__label__neg	Baby will adjust to wipes from the box in no time.
__label__neg	 Unless my daughter sits on it in a particular way, she ends up messing up the floor, AND SHE'S A GIRL
__label__pos	We just squeak the duck's bill and our son comes running for his bath!
__label__pos	These are worth a try even if you don't think you have large nipples.
__label__pos	It's very soft and fits well with our pad, which was made by another company. 
__label__pos	"""I just think this is an absolute must have for those with babies."""
__label__neg	 Basically it is boiling the water and the bottom of the bottle gets really hot and if you use the Vent Air bottle the water drips out of the bottom is it is really hot
__label__neg	This very cute product is designed for only ONE style of bathtub spigot - the kind that has NO water diverter where the water flows out, and NO shower pull-up handle (look at the customer pictures to see the illustrations
__label__neu	First I purchased the Britax Boulevard and then The First Years True Fit.  
__label__neu	It us super cute but my baby (since 6 month) spends her time removing the little connectors and uses them as teethers and that is NOT OK because it is easy to get little pieces to come off and swallow by baby.
__label__neu	I have already used it many times at home and taken it out twice to restaurants.
__label__pos	 No problems
__label__neu	We have been using it for a month and have gotten used to it
__label__pos	This Boppy is very comfortable.
__label__neu	Secondly,  I would NOT recommed this seat for a boy.
__label__neu	Then just slipped it back up and clipped it again when putting it back together.
__label__pos	She liked it a few times when she was a little older and could face outward.
__label__neg	On the rare occasions that we could get it to work then we had to deal with cleaning it
__label__neg	This gate does not keep enough pressure to stay in place, my toddler can knock it right over w/ little effort
__label__neu	And lets face it,  they get dirty
__label__neu	(Although I have purchased two others for friends and don't think this would happen with all the colors.)
__label__pos	The suction cups on it are very thick and stick quite well to my tile.  
__label__neu	Even though they discontinued selling the original they still sell the refills for the original right next to the the wide refills.
__label__neu	Just remember to cork the plug at the bottom of the tub.
__label__neu	My baby wouldn't even take it in her mouth.
__label__pos	This is a must purchase for your Bob as the cooler weather approaches.
__label__pos	It also dries very very quickly and can hand up in your shower.
__label__neu	Love it, but I suggest cutting the hook off.  
__label__neu	These bottles were terrible for us.
__label__neg	"""Why gouge the consumer for brushes to clean BF's bottles?"""
__label__neu	Also very few parts, although one part is very very small and is a hassel to keep track of. 
__label__pos	"""I was worried I thought that it would be small, but it is actually pretty big."""
__label__neg	My baby is a bit, uhm, round in the middle, and on times when it's cold outside and he has a sweater on, the front panel becomes harder to hook in.
__label__pos	The padding is excellent!
__label__neg	And then, it takes a LONG time to heat up the bottle.
__label__neu	The velcro is annoying,  and my daughter could wiggle out of this way too easily.
__label__neg	 I found that using a 13 gallon trash bag twisted around the diaper and then turned inside-out and twisted again then tied worked far better
__label__neu	It smelled disgusting no matter what I did to eliminate it.
__label__neu	When it's suppose to stay open.  Oh, well!!
__label__pos	my daughter loves this for the past four months (she is 9 months now).
__label__pos	It is easy to use.
__label__neg	The only thing that would make this product better is to have wheels and a handle.
__label__neu	Had I not realized this my child could have swallowed the tip of this spout.
__label__neu	I am a little on the small size and so the straps are on the bulky side as the other reviewer pointed out however since this carrier takes up to 40lbs I think I would rather have bulky to spread out the weight than thin and not as useful.
__label__neg	We used the templates provided by The First Years and they were of no use
__label__neg	He hated it
__label__neg	"""I was given a fisher price monitor that is a few years old from a friend and it was the best."""
__label__neu	The second one I purchased about two months ago and is completely useless.
__label__neg	And the settings kept resetting themselves anyway,  which is SO FRUSTRATING on 2 hours sleep
__label__pos	). It's very easy to use although it does take some practice to get used to.
__label__pos	He doesn't hurt himself and if you add a foam playmat under it it's even safer.
__label__neg	You have to wrestle with this with both hands while holding the bottom with your foot
__label__neg	But if you take a second and make sure that you are screwing on the top properly - you might have a leaking bottle once every 30 or 40 tries.
__label__neu	Far superior! My wife tried it out and, sure enough, agreed. 
__label__neu	My current model is pretty much a paperweight in the corner of the nursery and we have been using grocery bags to dispose of the diapers
__label__pos	Sometimes I'll hear it come on in the middle of the night if he wakes up, and it helps get him back to sleep.
__label__neu	There are no sharp corners.
__label__neu	It is open so that my son can get out whatever toys he wants to play with.  
__label__neg	)
__label__pos	It holds him comfortably and I never end up with back strain.
__label__pos	She loves it.
__label__neg	 I go through 17 diapers a day (because I change her immediately)
__label__neu	I don't think this will be as big of a problem next summer, though, when I can use .
__label__neu	She wakes up several times during the night without this but when she is swaddled in her swaddle me she sleeps 8 to 10 hours and she is five months old!
__label__pos	We have washed all parts in the dishwasher many,  many,  many times and not one piece has failed
__label__neu	"""Maybe they have altered the directions to help alleviate any problems since she purchased hers)."""
__label__neu	The actual heating insulation arm would heat up but not the bottle.  
__label__neg	But worst of all - it actually dried onto my nipple and tore some skin off when I tried to remove them!!!
__label__pos	It was also much easier to install than I thought.
__label__neg	Sometimes these bottles will taunt you
__label__neg	Was just larger than he wanted in his mouth
__label__neg	If you don't realize that the milk hasn't gone through,  the built up milk gets into the motor/handle and leaks out through the suction power control
__label__pos	At the price,  I can buy another if this one pops too
__label__neu	I bought the Medela system when I was pregnant b/c I wanted what was best for my baby...and I was led to believe that Medela nipples would be most like the breast.
__label__neg	We returned it because we really were unhappy with it
__label__neg	"""It is very hard to find anywhere to store this monstrous tub after the bath when it is damp."""
__label__neg	I really wanted to like these because they are cute bottles, but they did not work for my baby
__label__pos	This is why the remote is not that big of a deal: he doesn't really mind if you come in or out of the room, and as a matter of fact, he even loves the mobile if it's stopped.
__label__pos	I really feel that this is the best diaper pail on the market.
__label__neg	 Absurd.)If you do put them in the dryer, they DO unravel. 
__label__neu	"""We had been letting my son fall asleep with us in a family bed, but after a year of this..."""
__label__neu	This is the most poorly made baby bath I have ever used.
__label__neu	!
__label__neu	I bought this pump months before my son was born because I could not afford to pay almost $300 for the Medella
__label__neg	it makes a cute bath toy, but nothing else.
__label__neg	The soothie has no cover, transporting this requires a paci holder pod, which to me is a waste of money if you buy binkys that have covers on their own
__label__neg	I can't in good faith rate this well when it uses cotton only for the outside.
__label__neu	She was the 2nd 'toy' that we introduced after Lamaze's Mortimer the Moose.
__label__pos	I got my money back on this Swaddlebees and bought two more covers (a thirsties and a prowrap) for two bucks more, and Nicki's offers free shipping on all covers.
__label__pos	"""It is nice to use to prop up my arm when bottle feeding."""
__label__pos	Love Orbit
__label__pos	Amazing! The woombie that is sold on amazon at the moment is size 0-3 months (newborn and up to 13 lbs). 
__label__pos	At first I liked this because it gave me more storage and cup holders
__label__pos	When properly installed,  it provides solid protection,  although (important
__label__neg	Don't buy this brand.
__label__neg	My baby never wanted to take them, or when he did, he looked like he was going to choke (even with the newborn nipples
__label__neg	The nipple is so long that my infant was gagging everytime i tried to feed her
__label__pos	"""The tray is easy to put on and take off and the whole thing is easy to clean"""
__label__neg	It does  have to be pretty close to the ceiling to get a reasonable effect.
__label__neu	I spent so much time cleaning up my Zachy's Cheerios and snackies before I got this cup. 
__label__neu	"""This is CLEARLY stated in their product tag on the product."""
__label__pos	but it was still worth every penny. 
__label__neg	I don't like how it rests on his legs.  
__label__neg	Wrong
__label__pos	It is a breeze to assemble, light, easy to carry.
__label__pos	since then, it works like a charm.
__label__pos	The wrap design seems to really promote snuggling unlike the baby Bjorn.
__label__neg	Supposedly everything is BPA- free.
__label__neg	When I took the sling out, the tub became a HUGE pain-in-the-butt
__label__pos	We didn't start using the toy bar much until she was about 3 1/2 months, but now she loves batting at the toys and watching the lights.
__label__neu	You can posistion it at the end of your tub so she is on an incline as well.
__label__neu	I wasnt sure if I would use it but since I put it on, it hasnt come off. 
__label__neu	He also uses the bars to support himself as he practices standing up (with me sitting right behind him in case he decides to let go).
__label__neu	I just purchased a toddler bed for my child and the gate is used to keep her in her bedroom at night.  
__label__neu	It frees up your arms and allows you to carry out chores without anything holding you back
__label__neu	I washed all my bottles with soap before putting them in the sterilizer just in case.Also, now that my daughter has moved on to sippy cups, I use the sterilizer to clean those annoying spill proof valves that are impossible to get clean and aren't supposed to go in the dishwasher.I did use it occaisionally for my breast pump parts as well and it worked great for them, I just didn't get to breast feed for very long :(It saves time, energy and water!
__label__neu	I prefer to use the other brands that offer ziplock type closure
__label__neu	!
__label__neg	because of all the issues, BRU accepted my return and we bought the Eddie Bauer system instead
__label__neu	Otherwise,  what is the point??
__label__pos	I will rate this 4.5 stars out of 5.  but since we can only rate one star at a time then i rated it 4 stars here.
__label__pos	"""WHY didn't I buy this sooner!?!?"""
__label__pos	Looks great on the bathtub shelf tho!
__label__pos	This one is great because it is very sturdy.
__label__neu	I also think a previous reviewer got the medela shell types mixed up. 
__label__neg	Also,  he rolled to one side in it.
__label__pos	I got this for my 3 year old daughter.
__label__neu	I think there is a little less burping after using these, but the extra parts to clean when you take the bottom off can be a nuisance.
__label__pos	He is so relaxed in it!
__label__neg	 It smells like just produced toxic plastic
__label__pos	People are right!
__label__neg	If your baby is a frequent pee-er you might want to consider using something else
__label__neu	3-4 minutes.
__label__neu	So, I decided to try the Miracle Blanket.
__label__neu	The hole is too small which requires him to push forward right up against the splash guard.
__label__neu	and theres still empty pockets.
__label__neu	My husband purchased it when we were around 4 months.
__label__neg	There seems to be no middle groud between not moving and light speed.
__label__pos	This cover started out as my favorite.
__label__pos	I have had no problem with the motor itself so far. 
__label__pos	My son absolutely loves this mirror
__label__pos	You could easily store this in a closet when not in use.
__label__pos	Later it can be used as a step stool as they grow.
__label__neg	 I am constantly having to tighten the screws on the handles the handles, we've almost lost a few
__label__neg	It now sits in our cupboard, not used because I could never get the plastic taste out of it.
__label__neu	The old conversion set only came with one of each since ring.
__label__neg	After using Avent (wide nipple) and Dr
__label__pos	Fisher Price has a great concept,  but needs to go back to the designing steps.
__label__neg	Good Luck figuring this thing out
__label__pos	No problem getting it to fit our faucet
__label__neg	First of all the bulb syringe it's TOO HARD, and worst: it did not suck at all (the blue one from the hospital have been a life saver)
__label__pos	"""Once you figure out how much water you need to fill for your type of bottle/milk, it works like a charm!"""
__label__neu	He wasnt the tiniest baby... 
__label__pos	I like that I can pump one breast at a time or double pump. 
__label__neg	"""It only plays for 5 minutes, which isn't enough to get my little one to sleep."""
__label__pos	Between the Ocean Wonders Swing and this bouncer he is always entertained when we're busy or trying to relax.
__label__neu	Unfortunately,  it doesn't work well with either of the wipes we tried - Pampers or Huggies.
__label__neu	Warning:  Don't buy products from Amazon's vendors.
__label__pos	All the features were amazing and the base was heavy which made me feel safe when sticking the car seat in it.
__label__pos	She likes chewing the flaps and looking in the mirror.
__label__pos	 It is much easier to buy storage bags. 
__label__neg	I don't really recommend these specific nipple shields
__label__pos	We take them out probably 3 times a week and that works great.
__label__neg	 There are many things wrong with this pump and I hardly know where to begin
__label__pos	"""but these are nice looking easy to use and very sturdy."""
__label__neu	Trust me,  I'm a hairstylist.
__label__neu	It's just as efficient to throw your diapers in a regular trash can.
__label__neg	I wish it was longer since my 3 month old baby is almost too big for it now.
__label__neg	If you're not struggling with juggling a baby AND a bag, it is pretty easy to push a stroller and sip on drink.
__label__neu	They need to quit making this pillow.
__label__neg	Oops!
__label__neu	We had to make sure the AC was on 70 degrees every night.
__label__pos	best baby monitor for your money
__label__pos	Love this nightlight!
__label__neu	There is a point at which a small bit of water pools in between the valve and the spout, but it's minimal, and not enough to soak your entire living room.
__label__pos	The nail clippers and tweezers have a magnifying glass on them which makes it much easier for clipping babies nails.
__label__neu	We received this as a shower gift and have tried over the last 4 months to get our son to use it.
__label__neg	It doesn't TOTALLY eliminate the smell and the bags are hard to change.
__label__neg	It's washableNext, the cons:1. 
__label__neu	We had to buy this in a hurry because the product we had wanted (and ordered from Amazon) suddenly became unavailable.  
__label__neu	1. 
__label__pos	I love this crib.
__label__neg	Get My Brest Friend instead of Boppy!  
__label__neu	I do wish the pad furnished was a bit thicker and softer but it's sufficient.
__label__pos	"""It's great for late night feedings when you're drowsy and baby is hungry."""
__label__pos	"""You can take the hanging pieces down and hang up other objects so that there's always variety."""
__label__neu	(I wouldn't be surprized if this gets recalled!)
__label__pos	IT IS SOOOO comfortable 3 yrs.
__label__neg	Look for a more solid organizer
__label__neu	No matter how well I swaddled him with receiving blankets, he would wiggle his way out.
__label__neg	Before buying this check to see if it will work with your oven.
__label__neu	 Brown's bottles are the BEST BOTTLES ON THE MARKET
__label__pos	It's soft and water repellent so any liquid spills are not absorbed and can easily be wiped off. 
__label__pos	It is a great crib!
__label__pos	I can not recommend this highly enough!
__label__pos	I got lots of use out of it when she was a newborn for swaddling and have brought it out again now that she has started rolling over and kicking her blankets off.
__label__neu	Sheet has to be washed seperately from rest of baby's laundry
__label__neu	Just be very careful with the sling and your newborn.
__label__pos	He doesn't like getting wrapped and often cries loudly, but once he's wrapped he quiets down and even smiles.
__label__neg	Don't waste your money
__label__neg	"""The vibrating made him instantly upset, and while it's a nice feature that the music shuts off on it's own, there should be a setting to make it stay on for longer if you so choose."""
__label__pos	 It doesn't feel sturdy but it is
__label__neu	I have a little girl and she started using this potty chair at a year old (early, but just to get the concept!).
__label__neu	I make my own baby food and I got both the freezer trays and the travel dish, so that I can pack food for my little guy to take to daycare.
__label__pos	I readjusted the disc and everything was fine.
__label__neu	Unfortunately many  drawbacks that I just haven't thrown it out because we need it and can't afford another...The tray is too easy  to take off,  the permanent mini tray doesn't come off and makes it hard to put the child in and take out,  and the cleaning insert is laying in a corner in my pantry because we never were able to use it because it too comes off too easily...these are supposed to be aimed at fussy,  stubborn infants and toddlers,  right?
__label__neu	When we fostered our first child  a friend let us use a very similar one from One step ahead.
__label__neg	Don't buy this big plastic piece of junk.
__label__neg	 It worked reasonably well until just out of warranty, when the parent unit broke (the switch, apparently)
__label__pos	Due to that I decided to order several extras and was glad to see that they cost less than $1 each.
__label__neg	This was a waste of money.
__label__pos	You'll save on buying a bouncer since this is included.
__label__neu	I bought this thinking that it wouldn't work but was worth a try. 
__label__neu	 I wanted 2 diiiie I tell you
__label__pos	It is so easy to use and makes those middle of the night feedings just a little more tolerable.
__label__neg	 too much to do prior to getting a bottle ready for a fussy baby
__label__neg	Now, that he is six months he doesn't really seem to like swinging at all.
__label__neu	We use it each day and have only had to change the batteries once in the past 7 weeks.  
__label__neg	DISADVANTAGES*  The part that swaddles the bottom half of the body sometimes come loose - you have to make sure that you wrap the blanket around the lower half o the body REALLY well!
__label__neu	One thing to note is at one point they began making these bottles with the ounce markers marked as raised clear numbers.
__label__pos	The lids on these are MUCH better because they're a little deeper
__label__neu	Big waste of money!
__label__neg	 All babies get gas, all babies need to burp
__label__neu	Baby Trend will expect you to send the pail and the original receipt back to them for repairs if the filter comes out.
__label__neu	No real problem since we keep liquid soap in the bath anyway
__label__pos	We didn't get it until my son was 6 months or so, but I'm getting my money's worth now.
__label__pos	"""He also takes naps in it, we are hoping to travel with a smaller version of this pack and play soon..."""
__label__neu	I would just as soon put her into the bathtub and put a couple of inches of water into the tub and bathe my baby that way rather than put her into this contraption.
__label__neg	It's so hot where I live that we're all sweating by the time the AC cools off the car.
__label__neg	He hates it more if we use them and he's more still if we don't. 
__label__neg	) and it was a little more difficult to install than the car seat that we're using in our other car (the Combi Coccoro).  
__label__pos	Forget boiling water or whatever else, get the microwave sterilizer.
__label__neu	And yes,  rotating is a pain.
__label__pos	"""He loves it!"""
__label__neu	"""It allows the bottle to be stored on low for 8 hours and actually will boil water if need be!"""
__label__pos	It is sturdy enough that my daughter, who weighs 22lbs now, can pull herself up on it.
__label__neg	the lids don't last at all.
__label__pos	I have a Medela Pump in Style for use at work -- it is faster and I can rig it through my bra to be hands-free.
__label__neg	Nonetheless, a few things I noted.
__label__pos	The vibration is great for soothing him and now that he's 3 months he's learning how to make the sound and bubbles go off with his own movement.
__label__pos	It is very easy to put on him (unlike some other over the head/arm cheaper harnesses) and is very soft and comfortable.
__label__neg	While it was at a fine height with the carrier handle raised, it hit him in the face when the handle was moved back so that he could be put in or taken out of the seat. 
__label__pos	Medela's bothersome twisty ties), easy to get the air out (unlike Medela's), and the Lansinoh's take-up WAY less room in the freezer! 
__label__pos	It's safer than plug- in outlet protectors which are choking hazards and my 3 year old has yet to figure out how they work (he can figure out almost anything).
__label__pos	These bottles have greatly reduced my son's discomfort.
__label__neu	They can be found at most retail stores including Target and Walmart.
__label__pos	It's super cute and easy to store and tote along plus it's thick enough that even if you do pick a picnic spot with sticks and rocks underneath, you won't feel anything poke through.
__label__neg	The only problem I have now, is that my child closes the gate all the time.  
__label__neu	(I've had it for about two months now.)
__label__pos	It is so comfortable.
__label__neg	" We got it as a gift and I tried using it every day for about two weeks and my baby would just look at me thinking ""are you crazy mom"
__label__neu	If they want to sell them to get rid of the stock without that extra insert,  they could knock a few bucks off them.
__label__neg	Also, when ordering this from Amazon, I didn't realize there are different color choices, so make sure you don't get a pink basket instead of the blue one you really wanted
__label__neg	The only thing I had a hard time cleaning out of them was banana.
__label__neg	I had problem putting them together, no way, my baby could succeed.
__label__neg	However, it was really loud and honestly just kept my son awake since it was so stimulating!
__label__neg	The boppy just wasn't comfortable for me, it was too stiff. 
__label__neu	The design needs to have a little bit thinner of a handle for smaller hands,  and the top is impossible to get off.
__label__pos	It is for the safety of the child.
__label__neg	 It can also be quite warm or hot and that worries me. 
__label__neg	She struggled with the nipples hardly getting anything out of them.
__label__neu	Another review mentioned that it tilts and her baby rolls. 
__label__neg	Also the material was  in his face. 
__label__pos	"""It is VERY cute no matter how you use it!"""
__label__pos	Initial grip is really good but after a while,  the weight of the bottle of water started to turn it.
__label__neg	 But then I noticed that she kept waking up because there is too much leg room and she was kicking herself awake
__label__neg	 Even as a newborn, he seemed too big(born at 7
__label__neu	Now that isn't to say we never have to clean Cheerios out of her carseat or stroller, because we definitely do!
__label__neg	Of course this negates the cool mechanism and makes it a plastic trash can with a tight lid something I could have bought for cheaper.
__label__neu	She never had a problem sleeping in it.
__label__neu	So we've taken it back and our daughter doesn't seem to mind the room temperature wipes that clean her cute tushie.
__label__pos	It is easy to use.  
__label__neu	From now on he is only allowed to play inside when his shoes are on
__label__pos	I was playing with him last night and he was excited to see pupsqueak.  
__label__pos	It is very easy to use and lightweight compared to other twin strollers.  
__label__neu	We bought this sterilizer but have stopped using it.
__label__neu	If it was so flimpsy for a 10 months old,  how would it do under the weight of an older child?
__label__pos	"""My son seems very content while he naps in the swing as well."""
__label__pos	It looks and works like a regular trash can - just step on the foot pedal and drop the diaper in.
__label__neu	Perhaps this was a 'fluke', but I felt obligated to tell all of you about this.
__label__pos	It actually did help him to stay asleep. 
__label__pos	"""I like that it is easily washable and can be taken off the wall with the little plastic hooks."""
__label__pos	Also the old version seals well and does not allow odors to leak into the room.
__label__neg	Avoid this product if you don't want it breaking
__label__neg	I don't recommend the Medela nursing pads at all.
__label__pos	My daughter LOVED this chair! 
__label__neu	They are correct!
__label__pos	My son absolutely loves this. 
__label__neg	Well, he's now 5 weeks old and this cover won't even last through a 3 hour nap before leaking and soaking his clothes and bedding.
__label__pos	"""I love that it grows with my baby and plan to use it for a while..."""
__label__neu	I decided to quit nursing but wanted to give my daughter breastmilk. 
__label__neu	I found this to be a huge waste of money.
__label__pos	I purchased the safer bather and sat in the bath tub with her... she loved it!
__label__neu	The second thing I noticed is the lid would not stay closed.
__label__pos	At first I thought I had purchased a dud, but after a few minutes the pump grabbed on big time, and I was expressing milk faster than I ever had with the Harmony.
__label__pos	This is definitely the set to get.
__label__pos	The gripy surface on the inside of strap works great to keep cups/bottles from slipping out
__label__neg	 I have some exotic pets, maybe I will let them play with it
__label__neu	I don't think so!
__label__neu	I have taken baby into the bath with me more often &amp; Daddy helps to dry him off when we are done.
__label__pos	"""And, it's very functional."""
__label__neu	We initially really liked the changing pad, but after about a week's worth of regular use (5-8 times a day) the outside ripped where the velcro is sewn in. 
__label__pos	"""She ordered me one as a gift and I HATED IT!!!!"""
__label__pos	Must have for ANY parent who likes to go out!
__label__neg	Just so you know, this product does not work with the hygeia pump. 
__label__neg	The sheet seems to be made well though it fits a loosely
__label__neu	We tried contacting Firt Years to get the top replaced and were told they were not able to and to return it to the store
__label__pos	Luckily we got this for $30 at a thrift store in brand new condition so even though it won't last much longer for my boy it won't be a total loss like it would if we had paid full price.
__label__neg	HI,  I HAD THESE BOTTLES BACK IN 2002 WHEN MY SON WAS BORN BECAUSE THE HOSPITAL GAVE THEM TO US TO USE TO FEED THE BABY.
__label__pos	I really liked the zip out diaper changing compartment and front organizational pocket
__label__neu	The entire lining and all the microfleece (the part that touches your baby's skin) is 100% polyester! 
__label__neg	"""Don't waste your money on this one- buy the Fisher Price 900 mhz."""
__label__neg	It also restricts you in the kind of wipes you can buy forget getting Chubbs in its round container for instance.
__label__neu	She is not a climber yet so I do NOT recommend using it in this fashion if your child is.
__label__pos	It was a little pricey for a toy/teether but I'm really happy with her and my son seems happy too.
__label__neu	If it helps sore gums I am not so sure but we will see when that time comes.
__label__pos	but he loves to stare at the flashing lights when the songs are playing.
__label__pos	Another bonus is there is less clean up.
__label__pos	I bought it to use with my daughter, and I love it.
__label__pos	This is a great product.
__label__pos	They're really good when your child is self-feeding cold cereal, applesauce, oatmeal, etc.  
__label__neu	Thank goodness my mom also bought us the Fisher Price Soothing Massage Bouncer
__label__neu	Concerned about the chemicals in plastic bottles?
__label__pos	My 2 year old likes it too.
__label__neg	$52.
__label__neg	"""It was more of a pain for us."""
__label__pos	It's colorful and sturdy.2. 
__label__neg	It lets down smoothly for sleeping, but baby has to sit slightly reclined when it is pulled up as far as it will go.
__label__neu	I can walk for hours with my 20 lb baby in the Ergo -- not so in the Bjorn.
__label__neu	Your best bet would be to get one of the wrap- around warmers which have cute pastel designs on them and mold to the shape of the wipe tub.
