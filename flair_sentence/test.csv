__label__neg	I never even tried the shower because I switched to another tub which I am very happy with.
__label__neg	The flow was too slow and when I made the whole bigger it was too fast. 
__label__pos	"I had no issues taking the spout off as it has a small ""lip"" to pry with your fingers."
__label__neu	 TWICE
__label__neu	Many other reviewers say that it may be their area.
__label__pos	Great bouncy seat!!
__label__neg	I didn't like this because I couldn't see my son in the mirror
__label__pos	"""it's not like there is a stroller out there that can offer this much protection."""
__label__pos	There is a reason no one has rated less than 5 stars.
__label__neu	When you pull the monkey the audio says the triangle is blue.
__label__pos	Love it, love it, love it!
__label__pos	"""Also very easy to clean."""
__label__neg	One of the sides is also fraying just a bit and we've only had it for a month or so.
__label__pos	Definitely buy a cover (or two) - they wash up nicely.
__label__neg	 Not happy
__label__neg	 They get clogged very easily and forget putting them in the dishwasher- the holes seal shut. 
__label__neu	Then when my son passed the 15 lb mark and was able to straddle my torso we switched to the Ergo.
__label__pos	Very useful! 
__label__neg	Since it's water in the eyes which really freaks my kid out, it's useless to us.
__label__neu	I took the booster seat out of the box & put the strap over my should & the strap broke loose from the base
__label__neu	I originally wanted one of those cute frog scoop storage things from Boon, but once I thought about it for a minute, I realized that I didn't want to pay that much money for the thing and I didn't want to have to clean up after the kids!
__label__neu	I can't wear this item for more than 30 min. 
__label__neg	We were using one of those cheapy plastic block booster chairs and our 7- month old kept slouching underneath the tray.
__label__pos	I pump 4 ounces in less than 3 minutes.
__label__neg	I found the ultimate crib sheet to be much more trouble than it's worth
__label__neu	BTW, I saw pillow forms at Joann Fabric that are the exact same thing as a Boppy [...]
__label__neu	People stoping me and asking about this stroller. 
__label__neg	 So, I highly recommend trying something other than the Avent bottles for small infants
__label__pos	My baby loves every minute of his bath.
__label__neg	 In fact, a few times I would go in to check on her and her head would be in between the two foam sides
__label__neu	In an effort to save money I started with this one
__label__neu	My 20- month- old son has popped the pieces off with a really hard tug.
__label__neu	t has three heat settings for how warm you want your bottle and a red light on the front shows when the bottle is warming.  
__label__pos	I registered for this thinking it would be great. 
__label__pos	"""These toys are wonderful."""
__label__neu	If only the pillow were either longer or had more flexibility/was sewn differently at the u-shape!
__label__neu	I went through at least three or four other front carriers, trying in vain to save myself from spending BIG BUCKS on the BABY BJORN carriers.
__label__neg	I prefer the Lansinoh bags with the double seal
__label__neg	The reason we changed it is because the inner lid stopped functioning properly.
__label__neg	 I'm on the hunt for a new dresser because this one is about to fall apart
__label__pos	They are easy to sterilize, use and clean.
__label__neu	it has toys that hang for the younger infants along with vibration.
__label__pos	He loved the mirror the best.
__label__pos	He loves pressing the buttons to change the colors on the ceiling.
__label__neu	but then you can take the hanging toys off and use it for the toddlers.
__label__pos	I would recommend it
__label__pos	My son loves it and it keeps him entertained for a long time - much longer than a regular saucer.
__label__neg	Every time they moved up and down they make this loud continuous clicking sound.
__label__neg	Very very cute bottle but it has a huge flaw.
__label__neg	My son was been fussy colicky and generally a displeasure for the first three months of his life.
__label__pos	A good idea.
__label__neg	 The shoulder padding tends to slide around since they are not attached to the straps
__label__pos	Highly recommended!
__label__neu	At 2 months we took it out because she had head control and just layed her in the tub.
__label__neg	 The good is they are BPA free and easy to hold but I would look for another brand
__label__neg	"""A mobile should have music that lasts longer than this!"""
__label__neg	 My daughter hated it as a newborn & would immediately scream if I put her in
__label__pos	The assembly was really easy when it came in the mail.
__label__neu	I used Avent bottle (which I love - no gas!!) so maybe the bottles are the problem - who knows.
__label__neg	 Also with the original Twistaway, the refills are lightly scented, with this model you get nothing
__label__neg	"""How is this organic?"""
__label__neg	It makes a mess of the whole house and fills up the baskets. 
__label__neg	 I'm so paranoid about clipping his nails now because of these
__label__neu	One set of Grandparents use them and an aunt too.
__label__neu	looks like I'll have to find the manual.
__label__neu	After purchasing the depot,  I found it does not work well on my changing table (dresser style with fold out top).
__label__neg	 The 30% that it does leak, however, is a fiasco
__label__neu	We used it once and a piece plastic from the top tore off; a major choke hazard.
__label__neg	"""We put our son in it for all of 10 seconds, took him out, packed it back up and returned it."""
__label__neu	 There is no time to worry about all these little things when you have a hungry screaming baby
__label__neg	The first crib they shipped me was damaged in the shipment, so I asked them to ship another one.
__label__neg	This rack didn't work with any of them!
__label__pos	It even tells the temperature in the babies room so we know when it's to cold or hot.
__label__neu	My daughter was able to touch the floor right away
__label__neg	5 months and still won't use it
__label__neg	The milk then needs to be shaken to even out the temperature...a real time sucker when you're in a hurry to feed a wailing baby.
__label__neg	I own one of these things and have used it once
__label__pos	My husband who had never held a baby before we had our daughter was able to swaddle our little girl like a pro using this product.
__label__neu	Brown's bottles
__label__neu	"""Then I read this on CR and decided to live with it or change my phone:Mind the frequency."""
__label__neu	I would say if you are planning on hanging it then hang it from a wide hook that is low enough that your child will not try to pull down on it. 
__label__neg	I didn't know why my Mother laughed at me when I told her I purchased this and now I know why.
__label__neg	Each piece has to be taken apart each time for cleaning since the straws are small and the outside one is actually closed at the top to prevent leaking you pretty much have to hand wash and scrub out with a tiny pipe cleaner like brush (we use the one from the Dr
__label__pos	I think it's nice that there are a bunch of songs that it plays so you don't have to listen to the same thing over and over!  
__label__pos	My son is four months and this product is perfect.
__label__pos	This is one of the things I can't live without
__label__neu	Pros.
__label__pos	looks like a good idea.
__label__neg	It's not a bad product,  but it just doesn't work as well as a blanket
__label__pos	The music is a nice variety, and the little glow from the picture on the base is pleasant.
__label__pos	I was a little surprised at it's size (a bit smaller than expected) but when I realized my little one could hold it with one hand (or two) and hold onto furniture to walk with the other, I couldn't have been more pleased!
__label__neu	That it is a safety hazard if I should get into an accident.
__label__neu	 I got it together, turned it on, and the motor on the thing was louder than the music
__label__neu	I needed a light umbrella stroller but didn't want to give up and get ones of those cheap 10 dollar ones.  
__label__neg	If you run the monitor on just the batteries alone ( and unplug the AC adapter) then the monitor is pretty crystal clear.
__label__neg	I wish that this product was designed better because my son really does love it.
__label__neg	Big mistake.
__label__neg	"""This monitor was not very good."""
__label__neu	I had this pump with my first baby born 2 years ago.
__label__neg	This thing would not stay suctioned to the table
__label__neu	""")."
__label__neu	It can be annoying, but it doesn't happen often.
__label__pos	"""We love these Avent bottles."""
__label__neg	I don't understand why there is such high marks for this cheap,  flimsy product
__label__neg	I wish I'd registered for that one in the first place.
__label__neg	It's too bad I didn't know how impossible it would be to get the lids off before I had stored a week's worth of milk on these. 
__label__pos	Add to this that I'm able to talk to her even though I'm somewhere else in house or yard -- just what I needed!Setup was quick and easy.
__label__neu	I requested this item on my baby registry.
__label__pos	"""I purchased this car seat for my daughter who just turned 1 & we are very satisfied."""
__label__neu	Brown's, Gerber and Evenflo and she did not like them at all.  
__label__neg	 If I have just one poopy diaper in there, you can not only smell it when you open the lid to put in a new dirty diaper, but you can still smell it after the lid is closed again
__label__pos	I like the square corners and the mattress pad and sheets I have fit well.
__label__pos	Great product Sandra
__label__pos	But it will certainly be an even greater challenge for your child to open!
__label__pos	Either way it was well worth the money.
__label__pos	"""It keeps him interested."""
__label__pos	Overall I've been very pleased with them.
__label__neg	 I figured it would take time but if I followed all the steps, it should be simple
__label__neu	We actually didn't buy our bundle me until February so we won't get as much use out of it as we could have if he'd been born in the fall.
__label__neg	 First off let me say when you are sleep deprived you dont' want to be worrying if the bottle lip has a drop of water on it that will cause it to leak or if you have over tightened or under tightened
__label__neg	The pail WILL SMELL when you open it to change the bag for a new one.
__label__neu	He gets to look at the world around him in the front facing position.
__label__neg	"""Since it only covers the front, I have to use a sandwich bag to wrap the entire mouth area to keep it clean in the diaper bag."""
__label__pos	:-)
__label__pos	after finding these i will not be using any other type of sippy cup for my 7 mo. 
__label__pos	He loves the lights though.
__label__neg	My daughter is not a very active or bouncy baby,  but she managed to tip it over while leaning forward
__label__neg	very loud low volume setting very bright monitor lights (like having a nightlight near the bed -- I have in fact used it for that purpose when getting up in the middle of the night) loses reception frequently and if the power goes out (which seems to happen to us a lot) it shuts off and you have to go into the childs room to turn it back on (not the case with our other monitor).
__label__neu	We have twins thus,  two bins and the rooms that the bins are in STINK!
__label__neg	 When I finish pumping I have to express the remaining milk maually
__label__pos	We've also added some chimes (from another gym) that he thinks are great.
__label__pos	We have a bouncer and she prefers the swing a 1000 times over.
__label__neu	The plastic construction also gives it a flimsy and unstable feeling.
__label__neu	 At my lactation appointment they had a My Brest Friend pillow. 
__label__neu	inside.
__label__neg	very hard to assemble after cleaning, unless you want to clean it assembled which is not a good idea.
__label__neu	I was really optimistic about it so I got rid of the box before I ever tried it so I couldn't return it.
__label__neg	Great, but not for us
__label__neu	In fact,  I don't know of any who do
__label__pos	Your baby stays warm and it makes bath time a little more bearable.
__label__neg	The only part that I don't like and this is an individual thing is the ridges (tread).
__label__pos	It's large enough that I don't have to carry a purse
__label__pos	Now he loves it and takes nice long and leisurely baths playing with his toys, splashing around.  
__label__pos	Also when he is napping it makes it easy to check on him without actually entering his room - which always used to wake him up.
__label__neg	It is complicated to put on and adjust, and my tiny baby was completely enveloped by it, and I did not feel she was very secure in it.
__label__neg	"""He was a little dramatic, but this swing in my opinion is very dangerous and I wouldn't recommed it to anyone."""
__label__pos	 The only good thing I will say about it is that it's extremely sturdy (probably why it's a pain to assemble). 
__label__neg	"Here is what my Mom said about the gate:""The gate seemed OK but was very light weight plastic and we didn't think it was sturdy enough to keep a strong baby like Jay from breaking it out of the wall and then tumbling with it down the steps."
__label__neu	When she's done we clean up her mess
__label__neu	you have to keep buying new nipples there are sooo many different sizes
__label__neu	"""Be very careful when taking the baby out of the swing when they are in the ""front to back"" swinging position as the baby can arch his back and cause a fall if you're not holding on to baby securely OR just leave the swing in ""side to side"" postion to be extra safe."""
__label__pos	I like to go shopping with her in it so that my hands are free.
__label__neu	So I boxed it up and will be returning it tomorrow.
__label__neu	I started using this the day my milk came in and have used it every day since
__label__neg	The main problem I have is the battery life.
__label__pos	Great Crib
__label__neg	If you are in the market for a nipple shield, go with the Medela brand ones
__label__neu	We still have not gone past first gear.
__label__neu	This cream is pretty sensitive stuff,  good for a baby that has no serious diaper rash,  and good for a mama with an aversion  to chemicals.
__label__neg	One setting gets the bottle too hot too fast, try another setting for 15 min's and you still have cold milk! 
__label__neg	- It is near impossible to warm up this thing
__label__neg	When we did try to play a cd in them it skipped.
__label__pos	"""I won't use anything else after my sucess with this pump."""
__label__neu	But I almost tossed this toy out on more than one occasion.
__label__neu	For one, when the Champ is full the trash bag is a bit more then half full, but is also very heavy so you wouldn't want anymore diapers in there anyway.
__label__pos	This is a must-have!
__label__neg	I give them 1 star for myself!
__label__neg	 my daughter plays with that as well
__label__pos	A MUST HAVE!
__label__neu	I wouldn't let her sleep on it at night, or anytime she wouldn't be constantly supervised.
__label__neu	It keeps all those bath toys together.  
__label__neu	"""None of the baby monitors Consumer Reports tested was immune from static."""
__label__pos	They are a good size for a wipe. 
__label__pos	The co-sleeper was very easy to put together and very simple to attach to our bed.
__label__neu	She said that she had heard very mixed reviews on it
__label__pos	Really we could not be happier!
__label__neg	I do wish it had something that lit up and a little music.  
__label__neu	I feel like I might be doing something wrong but there is another sort of lock I installed successfully on drawers which I could not install in the bathroom cabinet. 
__label__neg	it'd be better if you didn't have to continuously push the button to get the soap out
__label__neu	"""I wouldn't spend much more than that."""
__label__neu	I also heat her formula up by putting hot water in a cup, putting the formula in a liner and dropping the liner into the warm water.
__label__neg	This is hands down the worst sippy cup I have every found for my child - as a drinking vessel it is completely non-functional
__label__neg	I don't think you need this.
__label__neg	Maybe we just got a malfunctioning car seat since it seems most people love this one.
__label__pos	"""Example: microwave sterilize them and after a couple of minutes, pour a stream of recently boiled water; mix with formula and put next to the ice bin in the freezer for five minutes."""
__label__neu	I think there are 2 reasons for this.
__label__pos	"I was against getting a lot of baby gear with lights and music and didn't register for it, but someone gave this to me, describing it as ""crack for babies."""
__label__pos	 I just keep it on side to side with the lowest setting and she can sleep up to eight hours without making a sound
__label__neu	NO SUCH LUCK.
__label__pos	Much more freedom than being strapped in a stroller or on someone's back.
__label__neg	 It is also very poor construction, the stiching around the elastic that secures it was coming loose when I opened the package
__label__neg	"""The only thing I would have changed is the length."""
__label__neu	being a former stomach sleeper, as i began to grow in my pregnancy i had to find something to help me sleep.
__label__neu	This is my third child and I have breastfeed all three.
__label__neu	I had bought this for my son at 6 months old for visiting graqndparents. 
__label__pos	It's easy to clean and saves you time on having to clean out a steamer, and processor.
__label__pos	"""After much research I felt good about buying this mattress, even online and sight unseen."""
__label__pos	It's great.
__label__neg	I replaced it with the fisher price aquarium wonders model. 
__label__neg	 It's too flat to align hips
__label__pos	I tend to leave things all over my house but with this kit I never have to search for tiny items.
__label__neu	Great theory,  but my little man just wasn't comfortable.
__label__pos	It never failed she wanted to go right to it and try to get it up
__label__neg	 Gosh, what do you know, the new child unit broke down, and we had only one parent and child unit, and then the second child unit broke down
__label__neg	I got these for back ups.
__label__neg	"""4.  All diaper trashcans are going to smell."""
__label__pos	I give this a 4 star,  it's genius,  but it's expensive (it's really just a t-bar strap that you could probably use your own belts,  so for the price it gets 4 instead of 5 star)
__label__neu	I was not sure how to fly by myself with my active 16 month old.
__label__pos	Easily wiped clean, adjustable band with velcro to go around bottle with rubberized grip, end attaches with velcro loop/handle.
__label__neg	pick something else
__label__neg	These are indeed a very cute idea,  but they don't really work
__label__neu	It turns itself on when in water and off when out of water.
__label__neg	I bought this because it claimed to have 2 oz in each serving (I read that somewhere and it also said that on the box when it arrived)
__label__neg	The insulating side compartment suddenly ripped so the foil was just peeling off.
__label__neu	Each time information is sent from the modem to the PC's, the monitor picks up static. 
__label__pos	The ultra light version of the Joovy is so worth the extra cost...
__label__pos	"""I am so glad we got this!!!"""
__label__neu	Since he can't crawl yet, it's imperative that he be carried around so he'll be entertained.
__label__neg	I immediately took the item back to the store. 
__label__neg	Made my baby spit up at every feeding!
__label__pos	It stands up to her limbs and no more limbs get caught. 
__label__neg	 The heads of the screws provided in the box continued to break whether we used a power screwdriver or tried to install them by hand
__label__neg	 which is rediculous
__label__neg	It is now sitting in our garage until we can give it away
__label__neu	Just a little smaller than I realized.
__label__neg	I agree with other reviewers that it would be nice if it were slightly larger so it could be used longer.
__label__pos	My baby kicks the blankets off of her every night, even if I swaddle her, and I used to worry all night that she was uncovered and cold.
__label__neg	They haven't helped at all, and one of them leaks like crazy all over the place.
__label__neu	*~
__label__neg	I have this item and it would be great if it was BPA Free
__label__pos	"""I absolutely love them, best parenting investment ever!"""
__label__neg	Don't waste your money.
__label__neg	It's bulkier than it needs to be, and the slider fell off of mine and got lost immediately.
__label__pos	These are great for teething babies especially if you put fruit in them and pop them in the freezer for a few hours.
__label__pos	The price is very affordable as well.
__label__pos	Then my toddler barfed in our bed,  and some of it unfortunately splashed on Snoogle.
__label__pos	I like the asymmetrical design; it allows me to tuck the larger part between my legs while the smaller part is wedged under my belly for extra support.
__label__neu	"I thought this ""Pacific"" was more of a blue color,  but it's more of a dark teal green"
__label__neu	The clasp is kind of rinky-dink, but serves the purpose for when it gets pulled on by baby.
__label__pos	So when they sit it in, it's fantastic. 
__label__neu	He even stood by himself!
__label__neu	On the opposite side of the colors is black and white which at birth made him focus on an object.
__label__pos	"""Yep!"""
__label__pos	"""The longest we have left it on is probably 1 year."""
__label__neu	I am not sure what this is made of, but it smells like marshmallows.
__label__neu	 My son seemed comfortable with it and I didn't have to worry about anything interfering with how the car seat was designed to work
__label__neg	Not to mention that these bottles let him suck SOOOO much air and caused him to spit up several times
__label__neg	"""I've tried several monitors and was ready to return this one as well b/c of the awful static sound on each one."""
__label__pos	The portability of this swing in great -- I've taken it into the bathroom to have him close while I get ready for the day and I've taken it to our backyard so that I can watch our older child play.
__label__neu	"""If the sound is too loud, I have a suggestion - put some duct tape over the speaker (it's on the backside of the panel)."""
__label__neu	However, as a first time Mom there are a few things I would have reconsidered. 
__label__neg	"""Yes, my baby is worth the money for his safety, but was this really worth almost $100 more than the others?"""
__label__neg	However,  in order to start the music,  we either have to turn it on before we start driving,  or the passenger has to do it (obviously inconvinient if there is only the driver in the car
__label__neg	It doesn't hold much water,  either
__label__neg	This manual pump takes much longer to assemble, has more parts to clean and reassemble, and pumps significantly less milk than the Medela DoubleEase I replaced it with. 
__label__neg	Both the fisher-price laugh 'n learn jumperoo and the fisher-price precious planet jumperoo were at the store
__label__pos	This is a pretty color and the fabric is so soft.
__label__neg	i wouldn't go with any other tub.
__label__neg	It wasn't exactly easy to put together.
__label__neu	It does have a wall plug which works but it makes it less portable.
__label__neg	I was used to the screaming struggle to clear my son's nose with the dreaded bulb syringe.
__label__pos	The color scheme is warm and the design of the animals goes well in a baby's room.
__label__pos	It really makes baby comfortable.
__label__pos	As for the figures, they are very colorful and well designed too.
__label__neg	 The material is too hard to squeeze out the water
__label__neu	The chair reminds me of a car seat and as such keeps our baby in place while feeding.
__label__neg	"""Now I love Avent items but this one they dropped the ball on."""
__label__neu	I bought several of these for my daughter
__label__neg	 So, I figured OK, let me try one more time just at the off chance I didn't have the top on perfectly
__label__pos	We have never had any problem with mildew (like some users) because we always dry out the tub between baths.
__label__pos	Pros: Easy to use, easy to clean, offers great support for baby's back and neck.
__label__neg	I am so annoyed that the height is never stabled
__label__pos	This is a great product.
__label__pos	What's great about this product is that you can adjust it to anyone's needs.
__label__neg	 Because there is no middle strap between the child's legs like in a carseat, they do slide down and the chest strap is literally at their neck. 
__label__neu	I moved it to my changing table after discovering I could order one of those Pack N Play Parent Organizers as a replacement part (even from another company's product!)
__label__neg	Never used this Back to Work pump more than twice after using hers
__label__pos	In it's four or five sided form, it's very stable, even against toddler rage! 
__label__neg	"""HOWEVER, my son is too used to the Bjorn where he faces out and did not like the Ergo AT ALL - he tried turning around the whole time."""
__label__pos	The remote is convenient to turn on music if he starts to fuss
__label__pos	I would not live without them!
__label__neu	I returned it and ended up buying the Moby Wrap which I love - fabric is soft and comfortable,  and my baby can have his legs out in almost all the positions
__label__pos	the best!
__label__pos	this changing table looks good in her room, i also bought the Jenny Lind crib.
__label__neg	 I ended up drilling and re-drilling in all four walls
__label__neu	She's always close by because I can wheel it around the apartment.
__label__pos	"""It is very compact and small, and fits in nicely with our small table."""
__label__pos	"He likes to ""read"" in the car, but his little hands often have trouble holding on to the books, so this solves that problem."
__label__pos	It is much easier just to the bottle in a glass on warm water
__label__neu	She was over the play gym thing.
__label__pos	this pillow has been my saving grace.
__label__neu	I bought this product because of the reviews I read about it.  
__label__neg	 Period
__label__neu	It gives them enough support, and more importantly, enough constraint.
__label__pos	It is the only place I can put him down at without having him cry bloody murder after a few minutes.
__label__neg	The bottles themselves are 8oz and graduated.
__label__neu	You will go crazy trying to find the tiny,  recessed screws on the battery pack,  in order to attach the unit to a crib.
__label__pos	Since they share a room, this soothes both of them to sleep but if my younger one falls asleep before the older one, the older one gets up and turns this on to watch the ceiling show.  
__label__neg	*****UPDATE*******The baby is a year old and I used 5 of these in rotation for the last year
__label__neu	I really like the light sensor option on the front and wished these would have worked out for us.
__label__pos	NOW THAT IS A BIG PLUS!!
__label__pos	With the LATCH option makes it easy to remove as well if we need to.
__label__neu	Having a familar character always helps as well
__label__pos	Soft & durable
__label__neg	 Disappointing
__label__neu	 Well... 
__label__neg	Maybe some have had better luck with this than others but I noticed that more people stated that it didn't work well. 
__label__pos	 Just because of that, I would actually raise it a star for use, but it's a DIY star. 
__label__neg	I think I had higher hopes for it.
__label__neg	 We lvoed the prism till it got 'pin stripes' on the monitor
__label__neg	My baby pees a lot and I just don't see it worth putting these great big things into the wash after she just peed
__label__neu	I really didn't want anything that made noise or had lights but we ultimately decided on this chair because of the one- piece splash guard since I learned that it wasn't uncommon for little boys to hurt their tender bits on other chairs.
__label__pos	"""He is now six months old and the Champ works as well as it did when we purchased it."""
__label__neg	The inside also smells like pee and poop no matter how much I clean it. 
__label__neg	IF YOU HAVE AN AGGRESSIVE EATER WHO THEN SUFFERS WITH GAS, GET THE BORN FREE BOTTLES AND NIPPLES - YOU (AND YOUR BABY) WILL BE MUCH HAPPIER!
__label__neu	The chair is nice and nicely made,  but my son did not like it at all.
__label__neg	This ink kit is quite messy to use
__label__pos	Cushy enough to plop your baby down and not have her feel what's underneath -- which in our case is an IKEA dresser. 
__label__neg	"""except that you'll only use it for 3 months  because it is so small and then it will sit in storage wasting that valuable space."""
__label__neg	First, polyester cover - scratchy and not very soft. 
__label__pos	My daughter who is now 8 weeks loves her swing.
__label__neg	the picture of a rabbit is kind of a dumb toy he doesn't show any interest in it at all.
__label__neu	For starters, we actually found this at a Marshall's store near us for only $34.99, so, we couldn't pass it up!
__label__neg	In our case,  these bottles weren't worth the money
__label__neg	One of the design flaws is the round silicone insert that eliminates the air in the bottle
__label__pos	He burps often with them, but he feeds well.
__label__neg	The item I ordered was labeled as cream but when it arrived it was very much a yellow.
__label__neu	One thing I did though was actually pulled the little speaker device out so it hangs outside of the bear's belly and it makes it nice and loud because it isn't being muffled from the inside stuffing of the bear.
__label__pos	My sister has the same table and her's is fine.
__label__pos	This bowl is cute and difficult for my daughter to lift and throw.
__label__neg	Again, she's got a strong grip but gets frustrated with it pretty fast.
__label__neg	These things are hit-or-miss, and we missed with this one. 
__label__neg	 If you want nature sounds, I suggest you invest something other than this product. 
__label__pos	Even though it's not THE GREATEST, it works great for being under $20.
__label__neu	And it seems like the more weight he gains the more creeks there are.
__label__neu	Then, once they were sitting up on their own, we would sit them on the mat.
__label__neu	These bottles are useful for storing milk....they are sturdy and fit in bottle warmers nicely.
__label__neg	I read the reviews and thought this was going to be the answer for the cereal bottles and bought 9 bottles in total.
__label__pos	It works so much better than swaddling in a regular receiving blanket because she can't squirm out of it.
__label__neg	My son's bottles leak when they are tipped over, this thing is like a slow faucet, 10-15 minutes and it's empty.
__label__pos	The colors are nice and neutral, but cheerful enough for a baby's room!
__label__pos	"""I was fed up and I decided to pay the extra money to buy this pump because of all the great reviews."""
__label__neu	and it feels about the same way as a baby sucking. 
__label__neg	 Kinda boring. 
__label__neg	And after I empty it,  I re-tie a knot and twist the top and the next time I put a diaper in,  it just spins and spins with out actually tying up the diaper
__label__pos	We removed it and it works. 
__label__neu	It just doesn't twist.
__label__neu	The corners roll up over time from shrinking. 
__label__pos	 It was great
__label__neg	It fit awkwardly and she kept leaning and falling while using it much more than without it.
__label__neu	It is the same quality that you will hear from a musical card when you open it.
__label__neg	Everything wrinkles really easily too.
__label__neu	I was excited about trying this fitted diaper, but now that I know how they work, I will stick to REAL fabrics. 
__label__pos	"""The vibrations are pretty good too."""
__label__pos	"""We bought it for my daughter right before she turned 4 months and, I swear, within a week of getting this for her my very ""colicky"" daughter was suddenly a happy baby."""
__label__neu	Wouldn't it be nice if there were something better than those refrigeratable rings to sooth sore, teething gums?
__label__neg	"""It is a bit tall, so if you are using it rear facing it does take up a lot of space."""
__label__neu	I never use it outside of the sink or tub, so I'm not sure how the leaking is.
__label__pos	Thank you, Thank you....Inventor of this Chair!
__label__neg	We couldn't get the sheet on right.
__label__neg	The other container with the tight lid was so tight and did not have a thumb pull or bigger 'lipped' side to ull up on
__label__neu	I would have given this item 5 stars was it not for how long it took to put the item together.
__label__pos	It helps with regulating temperature and allows for longer bath play time as the water doesn't get cold.
__label__neg	First,  I couldn't properly secure it with either the latch or velcro
__label__neg	 I didn't think there was a need to have sooo many parts
__label__pos	"""We didn't want more furniture if we could help it and this was a good compromise."""
__label__pos	"""So - if you are looking for something for the first 2-3 months, this is awsome - the baby is snuggled and cozy against mommy's (or daddy's) chest while leaving mommy's hands free - it is great for the transition for newborns."""
__label__neg	I guess I am never going to find a sun shade that actually sticks to my windows
__label__pos	She likes that much better.  
__label__pos	It got the highest safety ratings everywhere I checked and of course that is the most important thing.
__label__pos	The design holds baby in place &amp; our 1 month old (who is almost rolling over already) stays put during bathing!  
__label__pos	"""We loved it so much we ordered one for my mother in law so she can have in her house when he comes to visit."""
__label__neu	This bottle warmer was horrible.
__label__neu	As a new mom it is hard enough learning to hold a new baby let alone bathe her.
__label__neu	We were able to fit out Chicco Keyfit and teh Graco Turbo booster in this bag.
__label__neu	Skip it!
__label__pos	I still had a free hand!
__label__pos	and we loved it at the beginning of  his bath times!
__label__neg	That works fine except when you tip the bottle up to feed the baby,  the boiling hot water that has been trapped in the vent holes drips down your hand/arm,  and potentially onto the baby
__label__neg	On top of that, he never seemed comfy.
__label__neu	When ours died,  I looked around for something different
__label__neu	"""Maybe the reason the smell was quite strong was becuase we just use it for the BM diapers and regulars trash can for the other diapers that way we would not have to constanly buy refills."""
__label__neu	Fact is,  out of ten bottles,  five of mine were leaky.
__label__neu	This was a first baby gift for us and we used in frequently even now with our second baby.
__label__neg	 This was a problem because i used it on the kitchen counters for the first week
__label__neg	Perhaps the bottles don't need to be perfectly sterile for the baby, but I'm still hesitant to approach these as completely sterilized.
__label__pos	Not all babies need their bottles sterilize but if you want to be safe than sorry this is an awesome product!
__label__neu	Our little boy seems to like this fleece model a little better.
__label__neu	sleep on it at occassional naps.
__label__neu	 I don't know why they contoured it this way. 
__label__neg	My son could not get latched on correctly,  the nipples were too small,  and then when he drank from them it went down way to quickly
__label__pos	The colors are wonderful, the size is perfect for me for therapy for rheumatoid arthritis in hands, and well, it just beams!
__label__neg	I've read these bottles are made in England so I thought that the quality will be superior but how wrong I was
__label__pos	Turns out it is the perfect cushion (it has suction cups) to attach inside our sink and put baby in for baths.
__label__pos	This locks are the best.
__label__pos	"""She is now 7 months old and can sit up which makes bath time fun."""
__label__neg	This product is difficult to use, especially if you have two cords plugged in to the same outlet
__label__neg	 Please, try the My Brest Friend instead.*For nursing I give this pillow a rating of 1 star. 
__label__neg	"While it looks like it would be a great color, it's poorly made (thread count must be super low) and when it comes out of the drier, it has ""balls"" collected over it which also makes the sheet not-so-soft.  "
__label__pos	it startled her every time when she was about to fall asleep, so i took a rubberband and fixed it around the shapes so they wouldn't slide anymore.
__label__neg	They are almost certainly the most expensive
__label__neg	We had been having issues getting the stroller unfolded and I was considering sending the whole stroller back
__label__pos	The positives: yes, its very cute, relatively light, installs fairly easily. 
__label__pos	"""It is really cute and my son is already figuring out how to turn it on for himself."""
__label__neg	I'm not sure how toxic the water in it is,  but its still shouldn't leak
__label__neu	"""We bought a set of Tommee Tippee bottles and a set of Avent bottles, neither style had been available when my oldest was born."""
__label__pos	"""Buy it - you'll love it!"""
__label__neu	This defeated the entire purpose.
__label__pos	The two monitors linked up immediately.This monitor solves my problem and gives me peace of mind.
__label__pos	It was well worth it for the price and as the weeks have gone on he interacts with the different toys in different ways.
__label__pos	The gate is fairly easy to install (a necessary slim wrench is included in the box) and requires no screws or glue
__label__neu	This cover is just that, a cover
__label__pos	My daughter is now 8 weeks old and we have been using this in her crib since birth.  
__label__neg	Do you know how many diapers a baby goes through between the time this thing breaks and the time a replacement part arrives? 
__label__neu	Also,  when I tried to remove the cushion,  the tape removed my furniture paint.
__label__pos	The slipcovers come off easily to be machine-washed. 
__label__neu	I don't mind it at all.  
__label__pos	It earns one star from me only because it looks good and is fun for playing with in the bath
__label__neu	I like the tasteful simple black but would have preferred some color/ pattern options.
__label__neg	I have over $100 in unused Avent bottles that are collecting dust
__label__neg	"""My 11 month old daughter removed the lid within minutes and I had Cheerios everywhere."""
__label__neu	I bought 3 of these and will donate the 2 unused ones.
__label__neu	This was a waste of money.
__label__neg	That being said I don't know how kid- friendly this cup is.
__label__neu	1) My kitchen sink has one deep large side and one small shallow side.
__label__neu	*  Nothing else we can think of
__label__neg	I used my backpack like for 5 months and the seams by the zipper falling apart after like 40 uses.
__label__pos	Living in an apartment,  this tub is great for small spaces
__label__pos	It offers great support and if she has a tummy ache she will enjoy laying on it.
__label__pos	"""Sure, you can boil those bottles and those pacifiers, but let's face it: this is the 21st Century, and you might as well make use of your microwave."""
__label__neg	It's too complicated to put on
__label__neu	I noticed that some gave this pump high ratings but over all this pump gets just 3 stars. 
__label__neg	But once that passed I quickly switched to the Playtex drop- ins.
__label__pos	"""It is inexpensive too: just shop around for other sterilizers and you will see this is the best one you can get for this price."""
__label__neg	I purchased the Storkcraft furnature for my daugher's room after over a year of use I am really disappointed in this furnature.
__label__neu	we clean the heck out of her area of the table and then just let her have at it
__label__neg	At first they were okay, but then my son had trouble feeding from them. 
__label__neg	 This is a great idea that is red flagged by manufacturing defects
__label__neu	"""I added this to my baby registry as a ""test"" to see if it was really worth buying a ""swaddle specific"" blanket."""
__label__neu	The manufacturer should have offered a finish as an option
__label__neg	I wish we would have bought just the Boulevard.
__label__pos	"""I breastfeed, but for the first 5 days when my milk hasn't come in, I used avent."""
__label__neg	I finally gave up.
__label__neg	 They are also a cleaning nightmare
__label__neg	"""And yet we still could not figure out how to get this thing to work."""
__label__neu	Perhaps we are spoiling him.
__label__pos	The color is nice - not too bright and my husband doesn't mind carrying the bag if he needs to.
__label__neu	2
__label__neu	3
__label__pos	I absolutely love them.
__label__neu	My son is not that tall and his little feet hit the bar at the bottom.
__label__neu	 Brown's bottles
__label__neg	 However, after multiple tries, my son would wiggle free from the Lightweight Marquisette every time
__label__neu	"""I will update when I get to use it."""
__label__neu	It's hard to disguise that you are wearing breast pads,  which is kind of awkward.
__label__neg	I thoughtMaybe I could try the Diaper Champ since I won't have to purchase any liners Well that was a HUGE mistake!
__label__neu	"""My son has had acid reflux since he was a few days old, and after dealing with 2 months of severe spitting up I finally saw an ad in a magazine and bought these bottles."""
__label__neg	Finally, although the wide-neck bottles may be a little easier to clean, they also come with more parts than standard bottles, so it all evens out anyway
__label__pos	This Entertainer from Baby Einstein by far is the best.
__label__neg	if you wear a size Large shirt get the large etc Not very specific!
__label__neg	This item is not top quality
__label__pos	It's one of those products that you keep wondering what you would ever do without it.
__label__pos	I ended up using my front carrier more,  it supported my back better and still served the purpose of making my son feel secure
__label__pos	I thought all of our other sheets felt really soft compared with conventional cotton but this one is even softer!
__label__neu	It was just too painful.
__label__neu	I never really even travel by car too often
__label__neu	However:-it does not hold a lot of water,  so the water gets cool fast-the cusion is not that soft so I still have to put my hand under my babies headThe good news is:-it folds for easy storage-it has a little area for you to put the bathing items that you use such as some soap,  wash cloth,  or toys
__label__pos	Only way to go.
__label__neg	 Second, if you don't have all of the water wrung out of it, and don't completely submerge it into the warm water at the next bath, when the baby lays on it some of the cold water comes out and makes the baby cold
__label__pos	"""She cooed, smiled, and, for the 1st time, squealed while sitting in her bouncer."""
__label__pos	It is warm and comfortble.
__label__neu	 Spend the fifty dollars on your baby instead!
__label__pos	I don't know what I would've done with out it!
__label__neg	 The nipple was very soft and my daughter seemed to enjoy biting it more than using it to drink. 
__label__pos	"""but it saved my back and hips."""
__label__pos	This gate is great the walls are like a pack n play.
__label__neu	You get what you pay for
__label__pos	"""Yay!"""
__label__pos	It seemed very cumbersome to put a piece of fruit into the net.
__label__neg	"""Using one in a seat that it wasn't made for can cause your child to fit improperly in the seat, putting them at greater risk for injury."""
__label__neg	this product did not work for us i was very disappointed we are using the adiri bottles and it didnt even make the bottle warm i tried every thing
__label__pos	We didn't think we'd have much use for this monitor until our baby was older and able to scoot around in his crib, but we've enjoyed it since moving our baby into his nursery.  
__label__pos	I really like that this is a BPA-free sippy cup
__label__neg	 They don't leak yet, but there are little fissures in a sunburst pattern on the bottom of the bottles. 
__label__neu	I would not recommend this bath tub.
__label__neg	This product is one of the biggest wastes of money in baby gear I have purchased!
__label__pos	"You can't ""fill it"" with water, but it does hold water as you clean the baby, and it's very light and water repellent (so you just lift it and pour the water out when you're done), and small enough to fit on the counter next to the sink."
__label__neg	 I don't really see the point in this product
__label__pos	I think that is a good recommendation - we ended up buying a better stroller (Uppababy Vista) to replace the graco quattro that came with the travel system.
__label__neg	I'm lucky I didn't throw away my trusty little pot since I'm back to warming up the old fashioned way on the stove.
__label__neg	It leaks, the sling hardly stays in place, it takes up so much space, and you have to use it in the tub anyways. 
__label__neg	 Unfortunately, mine have only lasted about 2 months because the sponge starts to break apart. 
__label__neg	I had used the snack-trap ones before.
__label__neu	Bummi's whisper wrap is much better, and available on Amazon.
__label__neu	It says that nowhere on this Amazon page and I finally went to the Thirsties website. 
__label__pos	"""The color changing plug has also been helpful."""
__label__pos	It's also indoor- outdoor which is great for people with backyards decks or pools.
__label__neg	And it doesn't secure to the bed that well.  
__label__pos	this food organizer works great for jars. 
__label__neg	After talking to the hospital staff & reading parents' comments here, I do not plan to use it for my newborn.
__label__neg	"""one particularly messy incident with pasta and marinara sauce did stain it a bit, but this has faded now over several uses and washes."""
__label__neu	I'd have more lined up if he wanted
__label__neg	If I could change one thing I would want it to hold a few more diapers.
__label__pos	It is also easy to get the baby to sleep and then remove and put in bed or swing
__label__neg	 If you take the lid apart, you can not put it back together
__label__neg	"""I wouldn't recommend this tub for small babies."""
__label__neu	This bouncer is ok.
__label__pos	I am short and this cuts in at the bottom in just the right place to elevate my legs just enough.
__label__neu	C'mon having 3 kids who has time for dishes.
__label__neg	 I put new batteries in and it still doesn't work
__label__pos	I don't have a lot of freezer space and I like to offer my daughter a variety of foods, so, making a pound of sweet potatos at one time would do me no good.
__label__neu	I'm not sure why the price difference exists.
__label__neu	I had this chair sent to my parents house before a visit with our 6 month old baby thinking it will last a while longer than a regular bouncy seat since she doesn't visit there often
__label__neu	Also,  it's fun to look up and see his beautiful face as he recognizes himself and that he is truly gorgeous
__label__neg	But just so you know, a newborn can't sit very comfortably in it (give it a few weeks), and they will out-grow it by 5 or 6 months.
__label__neu	We have made liberal use of suction cup toys like this for our children.
__label__pos	I highly recommend this chair for both safety and enjoyment.
__label__neu	"""We originally bought one of the sponge teddy bear pads to put her on inside the tub, but found it unecessary and uncomfortable for her because she was now out of the water too much."""
__label__neg	You're kidding, right
__label__pos	Simple mobile, big smiles
__label__neu	 it's not amazon's fault... 
__label__neu	It also has a 2 minute letdown which automatically switches to regular pumping. 
__label__neu	It is very hard to replace the refill.
__label__pos	"""Our 9 week old loves baths in this tub."""
__label__neg	Right now they leak some in the pail adding just one more thing I have to clean.
__label__pos	This swing is worth the money.
__label__neg	"""Overall, a waste."""
__label__neg	I contacted my seller but never got any response as to why the logo was left off.
__label__neu	Save your money and buy something other than the Diaper Champ the first time around.
__label__pos	My daughter loves ours
__label__neg	If you do not tighten the ring perfectly,  it will leak all over your hand and baby
__label__neu	Just flip the handle and the diaper is gone!Now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will!
__label__neu	I already had a full size Graco Swing for my 2 month old but I needed a travel swing to take to Grandmas for frequent visiting.
__label__pos	"""He also loved to bounce up and down."""
__label__pos	Recently we traveled and I dissembled it (an easy process) and packed it in a suitcase with the rest of his stuff.
__label__neg	 Additionally, I found the big Dr
__label__neu	There are screw on handles and sippy tops you can buy.
__label__neu	Very frustrating to deal with--makes it hard to relax like you need to.
__label__pos	After having it spit up on and stained, it zipped off and washed up beautifully!
__label__neg	 But, you gotta be kidding me with the green light encircling the big power button the front of the unit that goes in the child's room
__label__pos	I don't see how a nursing mom can go without ever having to pump at some point, even if its for cereal when they start that.
__label__neu	I always felt like his little head was pressed to hard up against Mommy,  or if folded down,  it jabbed him in the chin.
__label__neg	The only things in it I can use are the nail clippers (but I cannot use the magnification because it distorts everything and I cannot see my sons nails),  the hair brush which is nice, the comb which is nice, and the nail files which I dont like anyways because the chalkboard scrapping sound lol. 
__label__pos	I have a couple of white pack 'n play sheets and they are holding up much better!!
__label__neu	Maybe it was just a fluke that I purchased the two out there that did this - but if I were you I wouldnt take the chance that there are more with this problem,  avoiding it altogether and buy a different brand!
__label__pos	I appreciate that they have velcro in all the right spots and are designed with the cosleeper specifically in mind.
__label__pos	This may be the best mobile I've ever seen.
__label__neu	We visited with friends for lunch one day and they pulled out this booster and attached it to a folding chair and brought it to the dining room table for us to use
__label__neu	What about those holes?
__label__neg	Buy at your own risk.
__label__pos	"""I like that its easy to clean - changing pad and all which is very helpful when you have a baby boy."""
__label__neu	!
__label__neg	my daughter could not drink one bottle without spilling the formula out of the sides. 
__label__neu	Just hold them in your hands for a minute and there you go instant heat up. 
__label__neg	"""and when I do, the infant insert keeps folding up or his legs keep getting caught, which requires me to do it over."""
__label__neu	As with all childproof products, don't let your kids see how it's done.
__label__neu	I got it as a baby-shower gift and have used it until my little one was ready to sleep on her crib at 3 months of age(actually, that's when I was ready to let her go to her crib.. :-).
__label__pos	This swing is the best!
__label__neu	Very cute but my son who is 6 months old doesn't seem as interested in it as I thought.
__label__neu	Bought this for my son, he chews it like any other items I would offer to him otherwise nothing special about it. 
__label__neu	Please ignore the reviewer who rated the seat one star due to the rebound issue.  
__label__neu	She was very small,  born just over 5lbs,  and did not fit to well in this.
__label__neu	The feeder does need to be hand- washed; a dishwasher will not get the bits off.
__label__pos	" However, I took the ""toss the taggie"" ball to a group play date and some of the older toddlers seemed to enjoy it"
__label__neu	That's pretty much the end of the good points
__label__neg	This bowls are worthless. 
__label__pos	Love it and have more than one.
__label__neg	My daughter slept w/ us or a bassinet until she was 3 months old and by then the diaper leaks and constant spit up were behind us so I don't have to change her ordinary crib sheet that often anyway.
__label__neu	Although they have a good reputation,  they definately have a drawback.
__label__pos	Yahoo!
__label__neu	Me too!
__label__neu	We put in the Safer Bather and fill the tub with our detachable shower head and bath time is soooo simple.
__label__neg	I am currently looking for another solution to this piece of junk.
__label__pos	Good thing I bought so many,  because each time baby oozed,  leaked,  squirted,  spit up,  fountained,  or otherwise made a baby mess,  I would have to carefully fit the straps back through the strap holes,  then remove the pad cover,  toss it in the wash,  and put a new cover on.
__label__neg	It tends to cut tightly across my shoulder at times.
__label__pos	Unlike another reviewer, I like that fact that it doesn't prepare a large portion.
__label__neg	"""The baby can face in and out and only up front."""
__label__neg	 I ended up having so much milk left in my breasts they got painfuly engorged & then resulted in getting Mastitis
__label__neu	. 
__label__pos	"""I give it 4 stars out of 5 only because it is hard to fit breast pump shields/pieces and bottles and nipples in the same sterilizing ""batch"" but otherwise I love this thing."""
__label__pos	I no longer had any pain when I nursed on that side because the nipple shild created a barier, and allowed the nipple to heal.
__label__neu	There are too many snaps and buckles.
__label__pos	"""I will for the next one."""
__label__pos	Must have if your stroller didn't come with cup holders
__label__pos	"""It's great in the rain and easy access to everything, including the wipes!"""
__label__neg	They are totally falling apart at the elastic
__label__pos	I am happy with the purchase.  
__label__neu	Give it a try.
__label__neu	Too pricey for what it does... which is not much.
__label__pos	"""I love this changing table."""
__label__neu	My husband wears it occasionally because the baby can face forward,  which the baby loves,  but I don't wear it any more
__label__neg	Well less tightening did not help
__label__pos	The drying rack and the bottle warmer are great
__label__neu	I received this swing as a shower gift. 
__label__pos	I finally upgraded to theMobi Tykelight GloMate Plus.
__label__neg	We thought of placing towels or blankets on either end, but that didn't seem safe.*The vibration is weak.*The toys are very boring and out of the baby's reach, which is pointless.*It's awkward to carry around.*After only two months, we coudn't find any use for this product.
__label__neu	It does generate a lot of condensation soaking the wipes at the bottom too much and making their scent disipate.
__label__neg	 He's not a fat child, either, only in the 50th % and it cuts right into his belly
__label__neg	I wish I had read reviews before I bought it,  because now,  after only 2 months,  I'm just going to replace it and throw it away
__label__neu	But based on the other reviews I see we aren't the only ones with this problem.
__label__neu	Look at the price tag on this compared to a simple audio.
__label__neg	The 2nd motor does the same thing. 
__label__neg	I was constantly fighting with this pillow.  
__label__neu	I am keeping an eye on Avent's statements.
__label__neu	But better a little loose than so tight you have to stretch it on.
__label__neg	Our daughter, now 7 weeks old, has yet to warm up to this swing
__label__pos	Love this little toy for traveing in the car.
__label__neg	My only gripe is that the sun shade is only 100% effective when the sun is pretty much directly overhead. 
__label__neu	THE MUSIC IS SOOTHING BUT I WISH IT PLAYED LONGER THAN IT DOES. 
__label__neg	For the basinett - don't bother
__label__neu	Instead you can throw your bottles nipples and pacifiers in here as needed and have them sterilized in 7 minutes.
__label__pos	"""this beats having to boil or nuke bottles to sterilize them hands down."""
__label__neu	I then tried the Evenflo Comfi that we received in out hospital bag.
__label__neu	She doesn't like that the Kiddopotamus blanket is too tight and restricting. 
__label__neg	 How frustrating
__label__pos	I love all the Dr. Brown's bottles.
__label__neu	i like to start of by saying cherry colour is not really cherry
__label__neu	I returned the product.
__label__neu	I regret not following the advice of the majority of reviewers on this one. 
__label__neu	We got this as a gift and  have used it 0 times.
__label__neg	 Then the battery died
__label__neg	I liked every thing about these except I wish they were just a little bit bigger when I take them off my daughter she has red welt like marks where they were
__label__pos	I went with this one.
__label__pos	I bought the expensive organic sheet from Arm's Reach for the mini co-sleeper, and I like it because the velcro does not attach.
__label__pos	The music isn't too loud.
__label__neu	They will find ways out of it
__label__pos	It is worth it!
__label__neu	I might sell it on e-bay or give it to someone.
__label__neu	If you want this product get the old square old version, which is the one in this picture.
__label__neg	Wish it came with a travel pouch/carry handle b/c I take it with me for overnight traveling
__label__pos	Our son can enjoy the outdoors in snuggly comfort (and his mom can still exercise in the winter!
__label__neu	!
__label__neu	Well, our son has been using it since about 4.5 months. 
__label__neu	Someone wrote that they had problems with the bottles leaking.  
__label__neg	The Learning Curve is not as well insulated,  the pictures come off easily,  and they leak horribly
__label__pos	"""i'm going to order the turtle one for his room."""
__label__pos	I am glad I researched it because I am very happy with it!
__label__neg	 If you want your toddler or baby to learn about music and cause and effect, simply put them in front of a keyboard or piano
__label__neg	I new I would end up turning it sideways to open and then spill when opened
__label__neu	Its best to put the bags of breastmilk in here, it warms super fast.
__label__neg	 The arms and cards tend to fall off if accidentally touched even slightly
__label__neu	I don't find it useful at all.
__label__neg	It is a great space saving design, but as noted by other reviewers, does NOT work with glass bottles
__label__pos	These blankets are simply perfect and exactly what I was looking for!!
__label__neu	I gave it a 4 star rating for educational because at this age motor skills are a significant aspect of their learning.
__label__pos	Overall, I still prefer my Babyhawk because it's much quicker to get on and I loved getting to completely customize all the fabric choices and features on their website.  
__label__neg	Lots of leaks with disposables.
__label__pos	Cute toy.
__label__neu	He hates it.
__label__neg	The sound quality was awful- very, very quiet even on the highest volume setting and, even worse, extreme static.  
__label__pos	It folds easily if you decide you don't want it out for some reason and it has an interior bag which doesn't collapse from the weight of a hefty bundle of clothing.
__label__pos	ConvenienceThis item is easy to wash,  easy to carry,  and easy to put onto shopping carts
__label__neg	You also have to buy the correct size so if you and your partner are different sizes, you have to buy two.
__label__pos	We have been so thankful for the heart-2-heart insert as our son has loved his time spent in it
__label__neu	Also, it is quite large for counter-top use but we made it work in our master bathroom, too big for the kitchen.  
__label__neu	The hammock was a waiste!
__label__neu	Now I have to remember every time to make sure I get a towel and shake the bottle a little to make sure all the vent holes are emptied out before feeding our baby
__label__neu	I did give this bottle warmer a chance.........
__label__neu	After trying a variety of bibs and still getting stains on my daughter's clothes, I tried this bib.  
__label__pos	I carry her around and can get things done in the home.
__label__neg	 Despite it falling apart on us, I just haven't found it very easy to use. 
__label__neg	I thought this would be a great idea.
__label__neu	The Boppy is also great when your baby is learning to sit on her own.
__label__neg	 It will cut about an inch or two and then stop and every time i try to do it again it just doesnt work, so i end up cutting it with scissors
__label__pos	Still, it's working out really well for us, and if it's anything like the matching mobile and Jumperoo, I expect that I'll still be pleased with the purchase.
__label__neg	And one hour before our son's feeding time we start warming the bottle.
__label__pos	This was definitely worth the money.
__label__neg	 My baby was even messier with this nipple, making loud smacking noises while she sucked and having a constant stream of milk going down her chin, making a mess everywhere
__label__neg	I used this once when my baby was about a month old and the carrier was really tight under his armpits
__label__pos	It's like magic.
__label__neu	So while the body isnt meant to work with any other pacifier, the strings and clip do.
__label__pos	I've taken this booster seat everyone - friends' houses, restaurants, vacations, and everywhere we go, we get compliments on it.  
__label__neg	Wipes didn't work and napkins were even worse
__label__neg	I believe they ARE the 3.
__label__neg	I thought it would be comforting to see my baby when she was rear facing, however as I soon found out if you are ever rear-ended this becomes a very dangerous projectile, that is aimed right at the babies head. 
__label__neg	I thought I might be able to live with this but I can not.
__label__neg	 My wife has a hard enough time sleeping in between feedings without having to listen to static
__label__neg	)
__label__neu	I registered for this pump because I planned to only pump on rare occasions, so I thought it would be silly to spend the money for an electric pump... 
__label__neu	This helps the bottle warm faster since all of the milk is submerged
__label__pos	it's banged around a lot and has held up
__label__neu	I use one under my sheets in the area my son likes to spit up on under him during &quot;let's give that touschi some air&quot; time and as a take along for diaper changes no one's going to tell you but they secretly don't want you to change your baby on their bed or sofa!
__label__pos	 What a dream come true. 
__label__pos	I love the colors they are just right together.
__label__pos	I love crinkling the bear head and watching my son squee with happiness.The fact this is organic cotton is also a nice touch since the toy does spend a lot of time in the mouth.
__label__pos	This monitor is decent for the price I guess.
__label__pos	Highly recommend this one
__label__neg	He hits his heels on it all the time (we removed it since he we never really used it).
__label__neg	Notice I said one because we won't buy another
__label__neg	"""A drawback to this compact design is the small tray - our bowl just barely fits on it."""
__label__neu	 Fortunately, my hospital has a car seat safety inspection station and they told me to take the Bundle Me off immediately. 
__label__pos	we're asian and trust me these trainers have made my life much easier.
__label__neu	I spent a lot of time looking at baby products.  
__label__pos	The upper strap is velcro and manages to fit okay,  but the bottom strap has to be placed around your seat and pulled down
__label__pos	 Incredible
__label__neu	"""I got this for my son when he was about 2 months old."""
__label__pos	"""Just wipe it down or for more deep cleaning, you can remove it and hand wash it in the sink."""
__label__pos	"""There's no static at all and it's so clear I could hear the clock in my babies room."""
__label__neg	"""As other reviews say the smell isnt that great when it gets full but its not that bad (I see it as a hint the bag is full and its time to change)."""
__label__pos	I ordered this because it contains the colors babies are first able to see.
__label__pos	It was easy to open one- handed (while holding a baby or carseat) and has a spacious basket that was pretty easy to access even if baby was in the stroller.
__label__neu	We stopped needing the snuzzler in her infant seat at about 4 months old.
__label__pos	It kept my 2 older boys busy for hours.
__label__neg	On the first one I received only one of the two clips made a clicking sound when inserted into the buckle and you had to push *really* hard to get the clips in
__label__pos	I highly recommend it.
__label__neu	 All he ever does is swing
__label__neu	Bought this bumper for my baby's crib which does not have a drop rail.
__label__neg	I got this from our registry and had to return it because there was not enough room for all the stuff that babies needs
__label__pos	Immediately I began to enjoy my sleeping hours.
__label__pos	The dual swing action is nice but, my boy only seems to like swinging side to side so, we never really used the front to back motion.
__label__pos	This is a GREAT product.
__label__neu	The only cotton crib sheets I've found so far that feel smoother are Laura Ashley
__label__pos	The picture is very clear, even in the dark, and the sound is super sensitive. 
__label__pos	"I was going to get the ""spindle"" changing table from POttery Barn Kids but found this one, at about 1/3rd of the price."
__label__neg	However, they do not hold up when you open your nursing bra for frequent breastfeeding.
__label__neu	If you buy this it could go either way.
__label__pos	As a bonus, you can buy an extra camera through the manufacturer, and set it up in another room... that way you can use one channel for one room, and the other for another (like if you have two kids!).
__label__neg	I do have one word of caution: Make sure there are absolutley no diaper tape edges hanging loose when you flip the cylinder.
__label__pos	The only bad things is that it moves a little too easily when I put the car seat in the car, and I have to constantly adjust it when I get in the car to make sure I can see my son from the front seat.
__label__neg	 The bottom line is you want a monitor that lets you decide what you want to hear this does not let you do that. 
__label__neu	This flips over the handle to hang on the handle in both positions.
__label__neu	He was only 2 months old.  
__label__neg	My post baby weight was over 200lbs, if you are over 200 lbs, this is not for you.
__label__neu	I breastfeed my baby with it every time, unless we're out somewhere.
__label__neg	There aren't warnings to this effect on the booster seat,  but I wanted to make the issue known to other parents to whom it may not have occurred
__label__neg	You'll just end up having to replace it because your baby's room will stink terribly.
__label__pos	I had heard that they were great but I never could have imagined how crucial it would be to me.
__label__pos	My baby loves this.
__label__neg	 
__label__neg	 The brush is too rough for a baby under 2, and the comb I started to use it when my daughter was 3 months old, because is too rough for a newborn
__label__pos	Ok, it too requires some special effort to clean but it breaks down in a way the munchkin doesnt allowing better access to the ring for cleaning AND allowing replacement 'mesh'  Buy the 'starter pack' with 2 rings and 2 extra mesh.
__label__neg	"""Also, it fits better around you when you seat in a glider or rocking chair."""
__label__pos	"""It's adjustable."""
__label__neg	BULL
__label__neu	Now keep in mind, those Cheerios are small and sometimes they do come out, but only one to two at a time. 
__label__pos	It is very simple to use, even when you are a first mum and are giving baby his first bath, and convenient according to baby's age.
__label__neu	Even though it clearly tags the product to not use for a sleeping infant,  it saved me at times when his reflux was especially bad.
__label__neg	My baby hates laying flat on his belly so I plop him on this belly down so he could still work out his neck muscles.
__label__pos	Evenflo starts much lower for shorter babies and it lets them jump a little too - something kids love to do
__label__neu	Drinks spill.
__label__neg	I can only imagine the difficulty a taller person must have getting it between their knees
__label__neu	Once a week I soak it with Lysol and water to keep germs away
__label__neg	ProsSmall and uselss basket.
__label__neu	I did better with the plastic ones that stick.
__label__neg	My only complaint is that the butterflies seem pretty useless.
__label__neu	I have read other reviews and women complain about washable/reusable pads, but after trying everything out there, I would argue that washable pads:*fit better*look better from the outside (these look like you're stuffing with Kleenex)*are a lot easier to put back in one-handed while holding a baby - no messing around with annoying adhesives and strange folds in the materialDisposable do tend to be better for women who leak a lot, but before settling on these pads, try both.
__label__pos	I can pump both sides at once in less than 10 minutes and have a good-sized bottle to show for it.
__label__neg	Because of this,  even filling the bottle with ready made formula is messy
__label__neu	IT'S ALSO HARD TO UNFOLD BUT I FOUND OUT THAT IF U CAN'T GET IT UNFOLDED U SHOULD PULL IT TOGETHER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THEN UNHOOK IT AND UNFOLD IT.
__label__neg	Don't bother with these. 
__label__neg	My wife worries a little that the fleece model seems to ride up onto his mouth and might suffocate him.
__label__pos	She's 5 1/2 months now and has a beautiful round head!
__label__pos	I highly, highly recommend this if you're going to breastfeed or even if you just want some hands-free time while still keeping the baby close. 
__label__neu	I'm updating my review on this product. 
__label__pos	All of our crib sheets are organic cotton but this one is the BEST hands down.
__label__pos	I've had a couple of other different swings to keep at their houses and neither of them are as wonderful as this one.
__label__pos	The bendable features seems great,  but the spoon area that's suppose to hold food needs better design
__label__neu	It's very expensive but it doesn't work well,  you need to wait an hour before you can pump the amount of milk you want.
__label__neu	My doctor told me to pump to stimulate my milk production which was coming in slowly. 
__label__pos	Decided to just buy a second warmer that uses water,  and to use a cooler for the bottles (our baby needed 4 anyway to get through the night)
__label__neu	We fixed that by putting a sturdy,  four-legged stool underneath her feet
__label__neg	 The straps kept slipping when we put our son in it, for some reason, we could never get the settings right to get the strap to stop slipping
__label__neu	Tub is sturdy reversible (inclined or sitting positions) and can be mounted on some kitchen sinks.
__label__pos	We hadn't read any of the reviews, but picks it because of its soft seat and soft-pastel colors.
__label__pos	He really likes it and it has been something he has played with in a lot of different ways as he has developed.
__label__neg	 He is 10 months old and this cup just does not agree with him
__label__neu	All in all it was fine and we replaced it because it was getting worn out, and we thought we would get something more attractive and fun.
__label__neg	Very useful if you can transport it without clicking the disc that activates the warming solution, and if you do it is useless if you are somewhere without a stove and a pot of boiling water. 
__label__neu	Remember this thing contains poop, so if it is not changed often, it will smell.
__label__neg	 Awkward under my head, probably too flat there
__label__pos	I loved this item even more when teething time came around.
__label__neu	 She has no problem at all with a different padded potty seat that sits on top of the toilet
__label__neg	 It's distorted and really cheaply made
__label__neu	We got this b/c the Safety 1st one was discontinued and we can no longer get refill rings for ours.
__label__neu	"""Our 6 month old outgrew her 4 stage bath tub & I wasn't comfortable readjusting it to fit a toddler."""
__label__pos	"""The flaps across the top with the zipper on them can spread out to make the bag much bigger when needed or sag in and let the two sides of the bag come together for a smaller purse-like big, if you can picture what I mean."""
__label__neu	As long as you change the bags when it's time for the weekly garbage pickup you should be fine.  
__label__pos	***UPDATE***Almost 3 years, two kids and many baths later this safer bather is still getting used and works just like it did when it was new!
__label__neu	I read in the reviews that it may shrink in the dryer,  and so I have been careful - hang drying it when possible and drying it on delicate when not
__label__neg	As for the Diaper Genie vs the Diaper Champ I have seen no difference in odor control between the two brands - both work pretty well to contain and control odor better than a regular trash barrel but neither are odor proof.
__label__neg	But the lid won't twist the bag if there's isn't much weight (at least 4 diapers or so) in it, which means it does a poorer job of containing the smell *and* occasionally makes a mess of the bag when you try to cut it (by pressing a button on the lid while twisting). 
__label__neu	1.
__label__neg	 The toy bar gets old fast, and already she is not interested in it. 
__label__neu	The first time I gave this to my daughter there was no hesitation at all
__label__pos	i reccomend this to anyone looking for a safe baby bath.
__label__neu	"""Here is why:"""
__label__neu	I returned the product and will be buying a quality,  heavy-duty food mill,  even though it will cost me more.
__label__pos	This bag has a nice changing pad as well as sufficient volume to store a newborn necessities.
__label__neg	It really is the worst,  most useless design
__label__pos	If you have two people you're much better off.
__label__pos	 It's softer and easier. 
__label__neu	The only reason why I give it four stars and not five is that it doesn't accomodate the plastic containters (gerber food). 
__label__pos	 So I had to settle for playtex dropins so far, no problems.
__label__neu	BUT I found a solution that works.
__label__neg	I bought these to use as swaddling blankets and after I washed them once they were too small to swaddle a newborn for more than a week or two.
__label__neu	If you want this monitor I suggest trying it out for yourself in your home instead of just reading these reviews because it does depend on how your house is set up just dont get your hopes up and be prepared to run back to the store to exchange just in case.
__label__pos	I like these the best because they don't have the plastic liner on the backs.
__label__neg	 Also, this is a horrible product because you can not clean the straw
__label__pos	This nifty rack is well designed and well thought-out, doesn't take up too much counter space but provides a lot of drying surface, is dishwasher-friendly and lets you dry bottles, pump parts, etc in their own clean space.
__label__neg	 They are made with poor materials, are too thin, stain, and both of mine snagged on my wedding ring every time I would pick up the baby, so there would end up being long strands of terry cloth hanging off of them everywhere
__label__pos	"""These are some of the more expensive bottles on the market, but they are so worth it."""
__label__neg	I tried it with fresh banana today for the first time,  and spent over half an hour trying to scrub out the fiber
__label__pos	 They will even replace your leaky bottles if you call 1800 54avent
__label__neg	Seeing that it was only one bottle out of the 6 that we have, I am not too bothered by it.
__label__neg	 The plastic cards are badly made--3 of them were broken straight out of the box such that I had to use tape to put them back together
__label__neg	"""I guess one has to be picky when it comes to diaper trash bags!"""
__label__neu	What a waste of time &amp; energy!
__label__neu	This is our experience. 
__label__pos	My son loves it and it worked great for introducing him to the potty. 
__label__neu	Should not leak.  
__label__neg	They take up too much room in my freezer. 
__label__pos	Every time she wakes up, she talks to herself in the mirror and just plays.
__label__neu	They don't seem much different than toys on any other saucer walker etc
__label__pos	and it has tons of storage, which is also a huge help.
__label__neg	In summary:Pros- Keeps things cold- Easy to cleanCons- Hard to pop the spout back in- Leaks very easy (we are talking that it leaks while sitting in the stroller.
__label__neu	She has very strong legs and always wants to stand with support.
__label__pos	All the extra compartments make this into a diaper bag if needed.
__label__pos	My seven week old son has loved this swing since he was just a few days old.  
__label__neu	Also, moisture seeped in between the handle and I suppose mold is forming now--I wouldn't know though.
__label__neu	I'll tell you- NONE
__label__pos	It has served so many purposes.
__label__pos	Nice features,  works well,  and goes for a reasonable price
__label__neg	 Even if they had worked for me, I would have been hard pressed to spend all that extra money
__label__neg	They need to be more descriptive in their product packaging.
__label__pos	I highly recommend this for young kids
__label__neg	So he'd play for about 30 secs then run off, waste of money for us.
__label__neu	"""but I'm just now catching up on reviews...."""
__label__pos	"""Fun, fun, fun!"""
__label__neu	The size of the tub isn't great either but then again my baby was born at 23 so I guess a smaller baby would fit better.
__label__neu	The milk does not actually touch the bottle so there is no way to heat it.
__label__pos	Love this. 
__label__neu	It helps when you can't get baby to eat and you still want that bonding and contact!
__label__neu	"And the worst part is that the support on the bottom of the shade is flimsy plastic & bent within a month from the pressure of being attached by one suction cup so that there are ""wings"" pointing into my car."
__label__pos	It worked for about a month - worked very well to
__label__neu	After she could sleep through the night in her crib, she would sit in the chair and play with toys or watch tv (gasp). 
__label__pos	For the price, it's a great purchase.
__label__neg	but the jist is:- it doesn't fit my tub (narrow faucet w/o shower stopper)- the item is made of hard plastic not a softer plastic that would be nice for the little kids heads
__label__neu	A tab on the edge of the cover would be enough to prevent this from happening and make it a 5 star product.
__label__pos	He loves splashing with a little bubble bath in it.
__label__pos	SO CUTE!
__label__neg	I exchanged it for another one thinking that maybe the first was defective but had the same problems.  
__label__neg	"""I had to do this so many times that my baby even threw up."""
__label__neg	Also you have to check every new nipple to make sure there is a hole at all! 
__label__pos	Helpful
__label__pos	I brought my newborn daughter home from the hospital yesterday excited to use my new VentAire bottles instead of the little disposable similac bottles that they give you at the hospital.
__label__neg	"""Also my 18 month old didn't seem that safe in it."""
__label__neg	Then his head fell off of the top and got wedged in between this and the bumper!
__label__neg	The Ktan is missing this last piece.
__label__neu	It takes up way too much room in a queen size bed,  pushing dad 2 be almost to the floor!
__label__neu	My girls are 3 and 14 months and neither one of them have taken this off after the first time.
__label__neu	My baby just slides right off of it.
__label__neg	This has a loud, annoying squeak and does really bounce all that well. 
__label__pos	These are fantastic cups. 
__label__neu	Also you are supposed to tear the little tab on the bottom of the bag to get the milk out.
__label__neg	"""We bought it, tried to use it, and threw it away."""
__label__neg	i love the lavendar bedtime bath,  but these are too harsh for babys skin,  especially excema
__label__neu	I was very nervous/paranoid about taking him to Yellowstone so I bought this.
__label__neu	The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I had to buy a sponge to use on top of this in order to keep my son from slipping
__label__neg	 My son hated it
__label__neg	It is really better suited for a pet than a baby or toddler.
__label__pos	He likes to watch the bubbles and listen to the music/waves/etc.  
__label__neg	However, there were several cons to them:1) the sealing disks start to leak after several uses2) if you want to build up any sort of supply in the freezer, plan on spending a LOT of money because you cannot just buy extra pieces - you must buy a whole new kit, and each kit only provides storage for 4 bottles!3) if you have a double breast pump, you have to buy 2 kits in the first place cause it only has 1 pump adaptor!I like the playtex premium nurser, and wish the storage kit was more economical (and even if not economical, I'd like it if they didn't leak)I recommend you save some money and buy the Gerber storage bottles, which come in a package of 4 and are very inexpensive.
__label__neu	I purchased Dr. 
__label__neg	Not as comfortable as I thought it would be.
__label__pos	I loved this tub for my baby!
__label__neu	That turned out to be the only perk of this diaper pail.
__label__pos	"""It also covers the whole seat top to bottom."""
__label__neu	It's not a blanket that will keep you warm, so don't expect to be able to snuggle up under it or with it - it's a picnic blanket for sitting, eating and relaxing on.  
__label__pos	Our son was super comfortable and relaxed during feedings.
__label__neu	I have had no problems getting the suction cups on it to stick to our tile tub either. 
__label__neg	 Thinking a second on another floor in the house would be a good idea, we grabbed this product
__label__pos	Sticks very securely to our tiled tub walls (we've had it for months now and it has never fallen down) holds plenty of toys made out of netting so the water drips out.
__label__pos	Otherwise it is perfect for kids.
__label__neu	I just recently went out and purchased new shade for my car to cover the corner this shade misses.
__label__neu	My baby boy (4 weeks old when I received the sling) always wants to be held so I was looking forward to being able to hold him all the time and nurse him hands free
__label__neg	I could tell that she was not very comfortable.
__label__neg	I would not recommend this type of carrier to anyone.
__label__pos	We hung this over our changing table, and our daughter was in love.  
__label__neg	Having to constantly check the bottle became too much of a hassle and we simply quit using this warmer
__label__pos	She loves looking at the colorful tentacles and listening to the upbeat songs.  
__label__neg	"""The only negative I've found is that I can't buy them in an actual store; all of our have been ordered online."""
__label__neg	What a disappointment!  
__label__neg	I have seen raving reviews,  but I just don't see why
__label__neu	I purchased this not through amazon,  but bought it at walmart.
__label__neu	The clip that holds that carseat is hard to get right, but that will be the same with any carseat you buy.
__label__pos	"""The music is lovely and you can set it to just one tune or to cycle between the three different songs."""
__label__pos	This blanket is also really cute,  I would have to say our baby did look really sweet when wrapped up in this blanket.
__label__neg	 The fitted sheet cannot be dried in the dryer, which is inconvenient. 
__label__neu	I didn't have it when I started but I really appreciated it once I got it.
__label__pos	"""I like the side impact protection."""
__label__neu	It came in quickly and at a very discounted price compared to other retailers. 
__label__pos	I have gotten my money's worth out of this Boppy; I use it every day still.
__label__pos	A great product that is easily re-purposed!
__label__pos	 If he gets fussy swinging one way, we turn him around and swing him the other way
__label__neg	You'd have more volume and less pain if you hand-express.
__label__neu	Instead I use the Lamaze
__label__neu	Then there on the floor was a demonstration model of the Baby Einstein Activity Center.
__label__pos	My child appears comfortable and the HUGS system ensures nothing rubs on her.
__label__pos	the lounger,  when dirty does need to be cleaned,  the down time it takes to clean it is tough since we came to rely on it so heavilythe covers are expensivei'd recommend this product to anyone
__label__neu	I loved the Travelling Toddler
__label__pos	I highly recommend this.
__label__neu	The only one that came open was the one that dropped on the tile floor as I pulled it out of the freezer, of course, it only came open because the container cracked and the milk cube went flying across the kitchen floor... 
__label__pos	It was fairly easy to put together, (I did it myself in about half an hour with the baby watching me).
__label__neu	5 month old can.
__label__neg	 When I have used it for sleeping I wake up with a sore abdomen, because the wedge is hard
__label__pos	They are made from the same materials as the comforter so match perfectly.
__label__neu	The older he gets, the more bath toys he seem to acquire! 
__label__neg	 My son took 45 min or more to drink 6 ounces out them when he only took about 20 min to drink out of the Avent stage one nipple even
__label__pos	Good for little one's who can crawl after it.
__label__neg	Thank you to the gift bearer,  it was a great idea,  thought,  gesture and surely appreciated but the system sux
__label__pos	This warmer is so awsome we bought a second one for our basement because that's were we spend most of our time.
__label__pos	Highly recommended, especially since the tub grows with you and your baby.
__label__pos	I have noticed no particular odor since we started doing this.
__label__pos	"""Mine is always happy in her chair."""
__label__pos	Anyway, well worth the cost for a variety of uses!
__label__neg	Very disappointed.
__label__pos	 Worked perfect first time used
__label__neu	We're considering putting the DVD player at a higher level out of his reach.
__label__pos	My baby feels secure, its the ultimate in custom adjustibility and size is not a factor.
__label__neg	 I took pictures of them leaking
__label__neg	I thought it was just a fluke, so I bought a second one and it does the same thing.
__label__neg	 After one use, it takes longer than the cheap therm got from the hospital
__label__neu	Do not get it if you can't climb over it.
__label__pos	Well,  I got it together all right but it is WAY too big for the bathroom and/or kitchen sink so I had to put it in the big tub from the very beginning.
__label__pos	A couple of weeks ago I bought the
__label__pos	The product is good,  if you need it
__label__neg	I've actually decided to spend a few hundred bucks and just get the windows tinted.
__label__pos	 The only reason it got a two stars rating was because the pump handle does fit extremely well on the bottles and everything fits in the bag nicely
__label__pos	But still very pretty!
__label__neg	 ANd its a pain to get the diaper down in there when trying to hold onto a wriggling baby too
__label__neu	He burps as soon as you sit him up (this might just be because he is a fast burper?
__label__neu	I registered for this item because it goes with the changing pad that I chose. 
__label__pos	"""They have this Fisher Price Papasan swing at the daycare he attends and the teachers kept telling me how much he loves it, so i bought one."""
__label__neu	I have now switched this pillow around & reversed it so the Head Part of the Pillow is now at my feet & I use it as a foot elavation pillow
__label__pos	A friend had bought the Exersaucer (new model) for her son and my daughter fell in love with it (even at 4 months).  
__label__pos	Features I love:*The seats are padded enough that my 3 month old and 2-1/2 year old are comfy* You can move the sun shade down completely in front of the sitting children if the sun is directly in front.  
__label__pos	The cushion also allows me to flip baby over so I can wash his back.
__label__neu	I thought it was a fluke and retured it.
__label__neg	Granted, there is a big difference in price, but when you're only getting 2 hours sleep at a time, the laundry is piling up, you haven't had time to go to the store or prepare dinner, and you haven't even had the energy to bathe yourself (welcome to motherhood), it seems worth the extra money to me to have a pump I can assemble in less than 10 seconds, get 4 oz. 
__label__neg	This item is not bpa free as described
__label__neu	Save your money and buy something else.
__label__pos	Playtex sippy cups are BY FAR the BEST sippy cups!  
__label__neu	Hi folks -We bought this toy on a whim while out shopping at a dept store.  
__label__neu	finger brushes just dont cut it for me in teeth cleaning so i just gave that one for my daughter to chew on since its rubbery and she did enjoy chewing it, but i didn't really use it to clean her teeth.
__label__neg	The spout is hard plastic so beverages can't be sucked out at all
__label__neg	2) The design of the vent requires some negative pressure to allow the air to flow into the bottle
__label__pos	"""You can change how fast the milk flows out of the bottle as you baby grows and the nipple is much softer!"""
__label__pos	This makes it easier to drop one side of a drop-sidecrib but is pointless if you don't have this feature and looks funny.
__label__neu	I put this nurser in with other bottles my daughter had used that day because she touched the bottle repeatedly during feedings after having her hands in Thrush infested mouth.
__label__neg	It's not worth the extra money for the expensive refills, so we've just been plopping diapers in the regular trash can which goes out a few times a week.
__label__neu	It is very basic and sturdy.
__label__neu	 They say because the Bundle Me goes under the baby it interferes with the safety restraints. 
__label__neu	"""Both left a lot to be desired."""
__label__neg	"""Besides, this ruins the table's finish."""
__label__neu	25 inches high.
__label__neg	MY BABY WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE IN THIS TUB, YOU ALSO ONLY HAVE ONE FREE HAND TO WASH THE BABY 
__label__pos	I was so excited to get this for my 1yo, and it is a great toy
__label__neu	Summary.
__label__pos	"""and the giraffe is cute for a boy or a girl!"""
__label__neg	I finally gave up and and bought another Diaper Genie.
__label__neu	 Put your baby in the crib or bassinet those are the only safe places for him/her
__label__neu	Looks like a science lab...but baby switches easily from breast to bottle.
__label__pos	It's a good one, but short-lived
__label__neg	At $159 the motor should not go out
__label__pos	The handles made it easy for my son to hold and the lids helped me not have a wet diaper bag
__label__neg	Negatives:The Click and Safe feature is pointless.
__label__neg	We tried going back and forth btwn breast/bottle using the Avent bottles but our daughter would get so frustrated and VERY messy.
__label__neu	If the sun is at an angle my son does end up getting some sun but it's still less than if we did not have the sun shade. 
__label__pos	It appears very well made and gives him a new texture/weight of toy to play with.
__label__neg	Our daughter chewed on one and the hole got a LOT bigger and leaks like crazy now - you can buy replacements for $7 for a pair.
__label__pos	Other than this issue, the product looked a good buy for the price
__label__pos	I've bought the long skinny Dr Brown's bottles but much prefer the wide neck.
__label__pos	"""But the pros far outweigh all of the cons!"""
__label__neg	 Overall, I'd say this is one of the most disappointing products we have purchased since the birth of our two month old baby. 
__label__pos	Great seat but doesn't fit my car
__label__pos	I have the backpack, good to travel with but I think I would have gotten the carry bag had I seen it first. 
__label__pos	We would buy this again, even at the current price.
__label__neg	"""Still, we have another bouncer that has hanging objects but no music and it seems to give her more active, thinking exploration than this bouncer."""
__label__pos	I totally recommend this toy.
__label__neg	 Don't waste your money
__label__neu	I got rid of the Diaper Genie II and bought the Diaper Dekor instead
__label__pos	It really keeps my little one entertained for about 30-45 minutes at a time.
__label__pos	We use the floating toys in the bath tub now ;)
__label__neg	The wood is light weight and really cheap
__label__neg	ON top of it, the fabric is awful , she sweats so bad in it, even with AC on high. 
__label__pos	"""No velcro, so the little guy can't rip it off (although sometimes that frustrates him too)."""
__label__pos	I feel so much better having this than I did before
__label__neu	We have been using it since my son was four months old.
__label__pos	"""One has the monitor on and the other is sound activated."""
__label__pos	The mobile is durable.
__label__neg	Terrified infact.
__label__neg	I wish I had known that it was made of this kind of cheap stuff, it certainly shouldn't be for the price of it.  
__label__neg	Every time myself or my wife tried to warm a bottle in this thing,  it either came out too hot or too cold
__label__neg	I wish I hadn't
__label__pos	We had a warmer that submerses the bottle in water,  and we found this worked faster and better.
__label__pos	This thing fits easily works perfectly.
__label__pos	"""But by far the best part is that my son is a happy little camper in this seat."""
__label__neu	In this case,  I think its better to have too much than too little
__label__neg	 Don't waste your money on this pump
__label__pos	I really recommend this product.
__label__neg	This Monitor can be described in one word-Horrible
__label__pos	I also like the netted holders on the side for when he is older and has the dexterity to reach in and pull things out.
__label__neg	"""We took the items back to exchange for a matching set, only to receive another unmatched set."""
__label__neu	This looked great on Amazon and I read the reviews before buying two of these SwaddleMe fleeces
__label__neg	While I used this bag,  it caused more frustration than anything
__label__pos	 The local Dollar Tree sells their own version of table toppers that cling quite well (pack of 8 for $1) and the Hippopatamus brand that Target sells that have great educational themes of ABCS and numbers 1-10
__label__pos	Maks them more comfy and keeps them warmer in winter.
__label__neg	When you put things in those pockets, you feel like they are lost forever.
__label__pos	I can see that it probably wouldn't support glass bottles, but for everything else it's great.
__label__neu	I am a first time mom and did a lot of research on car seats. 
__label__neu	Weird.
__label__pos	She sleeps in the swing longer than she sleeps in her bed.
__label__neu	"""I'd say he lost interest in it though at about 7 months when he learned to crawl."""
__label__neg	I would not reccomnd this toy if you are busy with something else because you do need to be watching her like any toy.
__label__pos	It has enough to keep her interested for as long as I let her sit in it.
__label__pos	Makes bathing easier
__label__pos	If I had it to do over again I would still buy the Diaper Champ!
__label__pos	Works great for me
__label__neg	"""This seat is not designed to fit over the tracks of the door, therefore it becomes unstable."""
__label__neg	She only needed a small amount of coaxing to take those.
__label__pos	This is a great bag for longer trips.
__label__pos	Baby Einstein productsare the best.
__label__neu	Save yourself the headache and get evenflo or playtex.
__label__neg	 As someone else pointed out, reception isn't always good on this model either
__label__neu	I have to wear 2-3 pads on each breast regardless
__label__pos	It was so nice to be able to pump directly into the liner, rather than pump into a bag that then needs to be transferred to the liner (what a mess!).
__label__neg	I really think it is overrated and not necessary. 
__label__pos	This simple little plastic and mesh device has worked very well for us.
__label__neg	The one thing I don't like is it doesn't have a rechargable battery like some other monitors.
__label__neu	Although the zoom and scan features work well on this product,  I would look for those features in a different product altogether.
__label__neu	Luckily my baby was fine I was more shaken up that he was in fact he was still asleep. 
__label__pos	 I love that most people don't realize I'm holding a baby when wearing it -- this makes nursing even more discreet than in a normal sling as you don't draw attention from people wanting to see the baby
__label__neu	Don't waste your money; just swaddle the old fashioned way w/ receiving blankets.
__label__pos	Nail files and alcohol swabs are nice extras.
__label__neg	 but I think she's rather intimidated by it and all the stimulation
__label__pos	All in all this was a great purchase and I would suggest it to anyone trying to adjust to sleeping on their side (I am typically a stomach sleeper) or to anyone experiencing hip pain.
__label__pos	No odors have escaped the pail in 3 months.
__label__neu	I registered for and received the Eurobath by Primo, but my daughter was just a little too small for the tub.
__label__neg	We followed the directions perfectly and it fell off within 10 hours.  
__label__neg	I wish it was a little bigger.
__label__neg	Potentially unsafe plastic!
__label__neu	Thee were times when I got so frustrated from having to stop,  disassemble and reassemble that I'd just give up.
__label__neu	It is a little bigger than the space alloted, but I find that the rubber non-skid bumps on the bottom of the warmer hold it within the wipes space... 
__label__pos	It covers high up on the neck so food doesn't go down that way, it covers the length of the arm so I don't have to constantly be pushing her sleeves up, and it covers enough on her sides that even if she drops food next to her the bib is still protecting her clothes.  
__label__pos	"""I would buy it again and would recommend it to my best friend."""
__label__neg	 The water in the tub becomes soapy as you rinse him off, so unless you have a detachable shower head (which I do not) then there's soap on him when you pull him out
__label__neu	She hasn't outgrown it yet, and has plenty of room.
__label__pos	 They instantly soothe her stomach so she can sleep, and they're a natural, homeopathic remedy
__label__neu	Its probably because my baby isn't tall enough,  but He can't put his feet on this thing without it sliding when he is on the toliet.
__label__pos	My daughter has been sleeping in it just fine
__label__neu	They don't even have adhesive strips so are constantly slipping.
__label__pos	It plays music, better toys, better views and most importantly- the seat fits so much better.
__label__neu	"""My son first had this in the NICU when he moved out of his isolete and into a crib."""
__label__neu	Once in a great while it will stink a bit but only when I used too big of a bag and have a LOT of diapers in there.
__label__neu	There's also a fourth timer of your choice.
__label__neu	It costs about $10, and lasts us for over a month.
__label__neu	She refuses any sleeping attire or blanket that covers her feet.  
__label__neu	We are hoping that the BPA concerns will turn out to be unwarranted.
__label__neg	I don't care for the avent isis pump. 
__label__neg	You can heat a bottle faster under hot running tap water or by heating a bowl of water in the microwave and sitting the bottle in it
__label__pos	Another great feature is the air vents at the top of the cups.
__label__neu	since the umbilical cord fell off my baby has been using this in our adult bathtub.
__label__pos	the diaper is great,  the way amazon is selling them annoys me enough to knock them all the way down to 2 stars.
__label__neg	Those straps are soooo annoying!
__label__neg	It is more trouble than it is worth.
__label__neg	"""also the music shut off every 7 minutes, should play for longer."""
__label__neg	And because it's so round and puffy, I had to use just as much muscle to keep my baby from rolling away from me as I would have to hold him up!
__label__neg	I make sure the surface is super clean, I add a little bit of water to try to create a greater suction, no luck. 
__label__pos	(The nesting feature is great for storage too).
__label__pos	We are usually fans of Graco or Fisher Price but Evenflo definitely has the upper hand when it comes to entertainers.
__label__pos	"""I highly recommend this pump because it saved my baby from being on formula."""
__label__neg	 We wasted more money throwing ruined wipes away
__label__pos	Its a pretty good wipe warmer.
__label__pos	My favorite feature was being able to use both hands to wash her or lather soap in my hands since the tub supported her so well. 
__label__neu	The only other pump I have experience with is the Medela Symphony in the hospital.
__label__neu	She figured out how to un-suction the bowl in about 3 seconds flat.  
__label__pos	Great for winter use! 
__label__pos	He's quite content to just sit there
__label__pos	However if your baby has any amount of colic it is definitely worth the extra few minutes of assembly for their tummy's sake.
__label__neg	"And the fact that you have to buy their ""special bags"" added insult to injury."
__label__neg	I will probably be able to rig it by sewing on some added Velcro, but would strongly recommend that you hand-wash and line dry, don't even let the dryer look at the wet item!
__label__neg	I won't use them anymore because I'm worried about what could be getting into my baby's food
__label__neg	BEWARE-Not like the old spouts
__label__pos	Fun to look at. 
__label__pos	They are great!
__label__neg	This leads me to believe that the plastic is indeed unsafe.
__label__pos	I loved the fleece version of this and bought the cotton one for summer.
__label__pos	She just loves all of the goodies associated with the mat.
__label__neu	The suction cups won't stick to the formica around our tub.
__label__neg	 Also, do not let the hose hang down when getting the water prepared because you will come back to it and find a big wet puddle on your floor
__label__pos	"""(Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.)"""
__label__neg	 Once assembled, I found that the pump leaked as a result of the suction petals not attached completely and totally
__label__pos	It is by far the toy he plays with the most!
__label__neu	I've tried offering this to my baby several times beginning at 6 months
__label__neu	UPDATE.
__label__pos	Especially no special bags to buy.
__label__neu	25 inches high,  this will not work for you.
__label__neg	"""The tub has absolutely no support for his head OR his body."""
__label__neg	"""My baby screamed the entire time."""
__label__neu	I used them with my older daughter, now 7, and used them with my baby born in March. 
__label__pos	And I would buy this warmer again in a heart beat!
__label__neg	We have many allergies in our house, and the scent on these cloths is one of them
__label__pos	Teether dream come true
__label__neu	We've added some toys to the velcro loops supplied on the seat and he just goes to town with them.
__label__pos	The strap also provides back & lumbar support.
__label__neg	These bags are very, very thin
__label__pos	It was comfortable for Baby but baby bath tubs in general are a hassle to set up and clean up and store.
__label__neu	, 2007, 1188950400B000LSYLFQA3NRHI8DY4W6AZ, B000LSYLFQ, A3NRHI8DY4W6AZ, Marcus I am sure that this seat cover would work wonderfully,  however the color is so disgusting that I had to return it.
__label__neg	 Luckily, I have an awesome boss, who allows me all the time I need to pump
__label__pos	 We love it because it swings two ways
__label__neu	It would be a great invention if it wouldn't activate itself! 
__label__neu	We use this in our bathroom and laundry room to keep her stationary while we do whatever we have to get done
__label__neg	They also flow too fast for newborns.
__label__neu	Of course,  now they look about identical.
__label__neu	This little pee pee teepee just fall right off when he moves!  
__label__neu	It helps me sleep on my back better (I WAS a stomach sleeper) and longer.
__label__neu	We also tried the Avent nipple and she didn't like those,  either.
__label__pos	This is a great toy and has had more lasting usefulness than most of the other gadgets we've purchased.
__label__pos	It makes it so easy to bathe my toddler and my infant at the same time in the tub!!
__label__neg	BUT, no one can get to let alone change the battery, the seat has tiny plastic pieces that slide into place to hold it in, and they don't really want to stay that way. 
__label__pos	Great for keeping baby close
__label__neg	"""the one little strip of adhesive was not enough to keep them in place."""
__label__neg	 We returned it to Safety first and they sent us the Prism
__label__pos	baby absolutely is enthralled with this thing.
__label__neg	It was easier for us to just use pen and paper to write times down,  no buttons to fiddle with,  no wrong times
__label__pos	If you need a shower gift this is it!
__label__neg	Also not matter how I placed the side things he always mannaged to roll onto his side.
__label__neu	These changing pad covers are of poor quality and have not held up very well to washings.
__label__neu	I received this pump as a gift.
__label__neg	The one negative about it is that the music is really fast it's the typical cute baby songs (Animal Fair Pop Goes the Weasel etc but at warp speed which is a little weird.
__label__neu	I only used the electric plug, never batteries.
__label__neu	Let's face it - diapers stink.
__label__neu	He really gets his hands and feet moving to get it activated. 
__label__neg	Not only that, but it really needs to sit around the hips in order to be low enough to rest the baby on -- and that never worked, it just kept riding up to my waist.
__label__neg	Four stars just because of the extra parts to wash!
__label__neg	"""Night time the mirror is useless unless I turn on the rear light, but that is not really necessary."""
__label__neg	I really do not reccomend these bottles.
__label__neu	We ended up washing his privates on his changing table before puting him in the bath and that was just becoming too ridiculous.
__label__neu	Although quilts are not recommended in cribs, I throw mine over a rocker and it is a really nice addition to the baby's room.The item I did not use is the valance.
__label__neg	The biggest surprise was that once you put the nipple on the bottle,  you can't take it off.
__label__neg	My suggestion.
__label__neg	(Anyone need my Medela set????)
__label__neg	I just deleted my first review, which I made after owning this pillow for a month
__label__neg	I didn't sleep well at all
__label__pos	I use it so much I had to buy a second one to use upstairs in the middle of the night.
__label__neg	 The spray was soo light that by the time I finally got all of the soap rinsed off, she was screaming taht she was ready to get out
__label__pos	"""***************Update- 2 years later******************We've been using this for 2 years now."""
__label__neg	It's too difficult for even a year old baby too pull out the pink vibrating piece and when you pull it out for baby the cord is so short it literally moves for 3 seconds max!
__label__pos	It drains nicely.
__label__neg	I got these to replace my previously leaky Avent bottles, and they also leak. 
__label__neg	When your child leans over to explore,  their little heads get stuck between the fixed post and the swinging arm and get banged over and over
__label__pos	great crib, easy to assemble (it was pretty much assembled when it arrived!)
__label__neu	Use it as a mini bath tub that can fit on a diningroom table, in your regular sized tub or on the floor.
__label__neu	Tried resetting,  no luck
__label__pos	These buckets are better and safer than a toy chest!
__label__pos	It is gentle soothing.
__label__neu	(Same goes for the matching hamper!
__label__neu	And everything shrank when I washed them.
__label__pos	This is a great buy.  
__label__neg	Do not buy!
__label__neg	My son is 7 weeks old and already over 13 pounds
__label__nan	I love the Vent-air bottles - tthat has been all we have been using for months now
__label__neu	Fourth,  don't even think of using this sprayer as a bidet,  as the water from the supply line is COLD (do you really want ice water spraying on your privates?).
__label__pos	If I am ever out of range, it signals me, and I reset it and it's good to go... A good buy for the price.
__label__pos	We used this ducka from the beginning and didn't have to use a separate potty. 
__label__neu	4
__label__pos	"""Keeps my baby entertained."""
__label__neu	We had this in my son's room from when he was a toddler to cover an monitor adapter that would have been easily accessible to him.
__label__pos	As I lost the excess weight,  I was able to tighten the pillow into a secure fit
__label__neu	Cups break.
__label__neu	Obviously, not helpful for those using pumped breastmilk, but much less hassle for those using formula.
__label__neu	With having twins we change the bag every couple of days.
__label__pos	There is plenty of room to fit everything I need to use at the changing table in the side pockets... 
__label__neu	but by 3 weeks
__label__pos	Easy to use and most of all its clean.
__label__neu	so we took it off
__label__pos	"""this will be a gift i give at all future baby showers."""
__label__pos	Even then, these odors can be minimized with a bit of baking soda sprinkled in the bottom of the pail.
__label__neg	I wouldn't have bought this product if I had known what a pain it would be
__label__neg	I felt that these bottles were very poor quality.
__label__neg	 It has to stand on two legs because you need to turn the swing
__label__neu	He was then high enough up that his back didn't rest on the hump and he stayed warm in the water.
__label__neg	 They do not &quot;grip&quot; our cars leather seats and cause the infant car seats to slide a bit
__label__neu	"""I received my Boppy as a gift."""
__label__neu	The stitching is coming undone everywhere.
__label__pos	"""My two month old daughter really likes it."""
__label__neu	We bought this when we were experimenting with the limited amount of BPA free options out there last year.
__label__neg	You may want to save your money on this one and go with something less fru-fru.
__label__pos	It was the most quiet and space saving
__label__neg	This is an OKAY diaper pail for the money.
__label__neg	One holds him while the other worked his legs into the seat.
__label__neu	The spout shape is just odd feeling in the mouth,  and the slit isn't big enough to get the liquid out without caving in a soft spot on the head.
__label__pos	"""Lots to look at."""
__label__pos	"""This one is even better though, because it also rattles!"""
__label__pos	I only wish I had started using it sooner.
__label__neu	When I leaned against it to test it it slid right off.
__label__neg	"""I love the fact that it will take any type of trash bag, but if you do not empty the pail out daily the smell leaks out into your baby's room and it does not smell pleasant."""
__label__pos	The nipple is soft on her gums and it acts exactly like a real breast nipple acts
__label__neu	I'm a first time parent, in retrospect I would have skipped buying a regular highchair entirely if I had known about this. 
__label__neg	 When she sits on it the splash guard makes her have to sit with her legs open, but as I mentioned the seat is pretty narrow so she can't really sit on it comfortably
__label__pos	"""I accidentally bought a Kiddopotamus cover for our younger son thinking it was this one and it doesn't go all the way up the back of the seat to protect it from indentations from the car seat..."""
__label__neu	"""Sadly, the wires loosened (it is many years old) I am going to look for a slightly used model online, its model number is 1550."""
__label__pos	It did support my back a bit
__label__neu	I didn't buy this starter set, I bought a few 4 ounce bottles and gave my baby what milk I had pumped and formula.
__label__neg	Total waste of money!! 
__label__pos	"""The seat is soft on little bottoms and the opening is great even for the smallest bottoms."""
__label__pos	It is very easy to use once you get the hang of it.
__label__pos	I started pumping about 2 weeks ago and find that this product works very well.
__label__neu	Although it is a bit slow (about 15 minutes) it is very valuable when traveling.
__label__neg	Has pockets and dividers... should work well!UPDATE - my zipper broke shortly after I had this and before it was 18mo old the clip broke.
__label__neu	I started out using Playtex Premium Nursers with disposable liners,  but switched to AVENT because I heard that they are so great and my Playtex bottles wouldn't heat in the car
__label__neg	The ONLY complaint I might have about the wipe warmer is that when I pull out a wipe, another wipe usually comes out with it unless I use 2 hands to pull.
__label__pos	Life is a lot easier when you have this swing.
__label__pos	"""Thank goodness they make this size!"""
__label__pos	Also we had Avent bottles too these nipples were much harder and much longer.
__label__neu	Ok, ok, I will admit, a diaper wipe warmer seems like a bit much. 
__label__neg	First of all,  the bottle has to be positioned in the warmer a certain way so that it presses a safety latch to keep the warmer on
__label__pos	The colors are great and the animals are adorable.  
__label__pos	I love twirling the spinner for my son.
__label__neu	Cons:Light weightGood canopy size5 point harnessRecline (thoug not alot but is comfortable for my 4 months old)Durable madeEasily clean seat fabricDoes not tip over when my diaper bag and shopping bags hand over the handle.
__label__neg	"""But the edges are very sharp so placement is key when nipples are sore."""
__label__neg	 Money down the drain, since I now have to replace it with a cloth cover
__label__pos	"""They are very safe and hold up to much abuse, including my 3 year olds grabbing the bars and shaking it."""
__label__neu	I understand,  but it was still too big.
__label__pos	 I'm actually glad I purchased it
__label__pos	"""they come with quite good head-rests, etc."""
__label__neu	If you have a crib that has rounded ends as we do,  it is difficult to attach,  although we did figure a way.
__label__neu	"""So this time I marked where I wanted to screw in the padded discs, because not having a gate at all is NOT an option (we occasionally need to put down mousetraps, and don't want her to get to them and hurt herself)."""
__label__neu	since I only have a stand up shower I put it on the floor of the shower and use my detachable shower head.
__label__neu	I also have the Flutterbye version, which is even better.
__label__neg	It's a shame the song isn't longer.4. 
__label__pos	LOVE THIS BOUNCER!!!
__label__neg	What a waste of money.
__label__neg	Also it is hard to clean with too many cracks and sometimes it leaks. 
__label__pos	The music and the lights are a perfect combo.
__label__neg	 We tried the carrier on 16 month old (at that time) and it took to look to put on and immediately began to sag
__label__pos	It's easily installed and it gives adults easy access to the adapter.
__label__pos	*  Keeps them warm with nothing else required.
__label__neg	I wish this were the case for all baby gear, although if you research and choose wisely, there are plenty of options out there.
__label__pos	It is very stimulating and the 15 minutes of music is a nice variety. 
__label__neu	My baby slid to the bottom and her face was completely covered.
__label__neg	It takes forever to warm the milk which make baby really frustrated
__label__neu	"""Unfortunately once they can move they no longer are interested in it and we have another useless piece of furniture to store but for the money (my mom got it for us) it was useful for a time."""
__label__neu	I think because the base of the nipple was not as big as the Playtex nipples.  
__label__pos	We have used it since she was able to take a bath, and she's 4 months old.
__label__neu	"""You will not be disappointed."""
__label__neu	So I went out and bought it along with a big box of tall kitchen bags. 
__label__pos	Typically,  it works alright
__label__neu	When I was a brand-new mom,  eager to color-coordinate my baby's nursery,  I bought terrycloth changing pag covers in almost every shade available.
__label__pos	You will not be disappointed!
__label__neu	It doesn't even hold a small accident.
__label__neg	 The execution, however, is lousy
__label__neu	Get the Diaper Champ or use a regular trash can and put it out of the way (extra bathroom, laundry room, etc.)
__label__neg	However, the cushion on the bottom has bunched up inside the fabric and I have not been able to flatten it out. 
__label__pos	I am sold!!!
__label__neu	At 37 weeks I figure I can give an accurate review of this pillow.
__label__neg	I have a trailblazer (06) and the mat is too short so it rolls up on the sides and doesn't fit properly
__label__neg	I bought this tub for my friend and she said it was a terrible product. 
__label__neu	When we decided to leave her with grandma for a few nights we knew we needed a crib.
__label__neg	someone gave me an avent bottle to try.
__label__neu	!
__label__neg	For such an expensive item the quality is very poor.
__label__pos	I get more milk with this pump than with my double electric.
__label__neu	After a year of trying everything except drilling through my tile (thought about it!),  I just got rid of mine.
__label__pos	I'm pretty sure the wipes are just fine.
__label__neg	The second, and biggest, problem is that the rubber insert doesn't go all the way to the edges of the cup.
__label__pos	I bought these bottles after reading reviews on them and have been pretty happy with them.
__label__neu	My 1 year old tries and tries until he gives up.
__label__neg	This pretty much isn't the solution.
__label__pos	Maybe that's a flaw, but it is so much easier to get on and off (and avoid damaging the bed), and it's plenty snug.
__label__neg	 This product was not thoughtfully made in my opinion
__label__neu	She's 18 months old now and we fill the tub to the brim in the big bathtub.
__label__neg	Great concept,  but just too big to work
__label__neg	 Small and skimpy. 
__label__neu	Brought it home and discovered the adjustment is available only on one side - rendering it useless.
__label__neu	I hope it is made of good quality paint as she chews a lot too.
__label__neu	I spent around $50 on a set of these bottles only to find they made her gas worse.
__label__neu	I just called AVENT customer service and they tried to tell me I was using the incorrect kind of WATER to wash the unit out
__label__neu	The shower idea is great it just need a lot of improving.
__label__neg	"""sorry, but it's low quality"""
__label__pos	"""Enter the Leap Frog Dreamscapes Soother."""
__label__neu	Brown's bottles. 
__label__neg	"""You do get the hang of it but it still takes time to get it just right and drags the floor in the process."""
__label__pos	I did research when I was registering before the baby and looked at all of the other diaper pails and this one was the one that came out ahead. 
__label__neu	At this stage it's a little difficult to get the lower end under my top knee for hip support but that's no doubt an issue whatever pillow one uses.
__label__pos	 Great concept though. 
__label__neg	 However, now that my son is in size 3 diapers it gets fulls so fast
__label__pos	"""Then, she noticed the mobile at 5 weeks, which entertained her for weeks."""
__label__pos	After researching various different monitors I purchased this one based on the reviews written here.
__label__neu	It's great for the baby who loves to stand all the time and the parent who just can't hold her enough.The one problem that we had with the toy is that her hands would get stuck in the leg holes even when we were keeping our eyes on her.
__label__neg	 I will return this and keep my cheap ice cube trays to use instead
__label__neu	I thought about putting a book under the player,  but I think he would just lift it and get into it.
__label__pos	MY DAUGHTER LIKES TO REACH AND GRAB THE HANGING FISH. 
__label__pos	Ours gets lots of use every day and yet looks like it just came out of the box brand new.
__label__neu	I bought the euro tub and it may in the future be a good thing but not right now...
__label__pos	Love, Love it.
__label__neu	We did like that this set would work for a boy or a girl too.
__label__pos	"""but it's also large so you can use this as a great cover for breast feeding, covering baby, floor cover, etc."""
__label__neu	That being said,  you need to make sure the toilet lock snaps back into place after closing the toilet lid
__label__neu	"""Once she was actually walking we pulled the seat off and left it as a playtable for her..."""
__label__neg	 What many people overlook in their rush to buy BPA free bottles is that Born Free is hardly the only option (although they are probably the most visible)
__label__pos	My son age 9 is now able to feel safe and secure in his own room.
__label__neg	We suffered with the terrible static and screeching for five months
__label__neu	PLEASE just spend the extra dollar to get a carrier that has an actual locking mechanism.
__label__neu	I got this with the extension.
__label__neu	It also has non- skid rubber feet on the bottom of all four corners.
__label__pos	"""The straps are easily adjustable."""
__label__neg	This is NOTHING like that.
__label__neg	PLus,I felt like it was a big production to set the bath up at night.
__label__neu	"""Most newer cordless phones are either 2.4 gigahertz or 900 megahertz."""
__label__pos	Our son loved to cuddle down inside and fall asleep, and I never had to worry about the cold air getting to him.
__label__neu	Sure,  it's a little large for some of the smaller shopping carts or restaurant highchairs,  but the excess material doesn't really get in the way
__label__neg	It would be fine if we were pushing the limits of the range, but one room over it loses connection and reconnects twice an hour without being moved or touched.
__label__pos	There's so much static that it almost completely drowns out my crying baby!
__label__neg	 I also had several problems with the stroller
__label__neu	It was frustrating, and we had to keep breaking the seal in his mouth for him. If you're going to use Dr. Brown's, stick to these bottles only. 
__label__pos	Any licking or chewing will happen to the cart cover only,  THANK GOODNESS
__label__pos	We've been at a loss for someplace to rest her other than our arms during waking hours.
__label__pos	I also find it safer to use over the microwave sterilizer which i think can leech the plastic..especially not everything I have is bpa free.5 stars undoubtedly!
__label__pos	I'm pleased with this monitor
__label__neu	Who wants a disposable system where you have to keep (and wash) the lids
__label__pos	"""But anyway, this thing is AWESOME!"""
__label__neu	Plus it can also be used as a trash can
__label__pos	"""He also loves banging them around and they've held up really good."""
__label__pos	I love this diaper pail!
__label__neg	 It was really really difficult to attach the mirror - there was absolutely no place to attach it in order to see the baby
__label__neg	"""The only negative is it must be spot cleaned; my baby drools all over it, so when I wash it, it's out of commission until it dries completely, which is usually the next day."""
__label__neu	don't [spend] your money on this monitor.
__label__pos	"""and it was MUCH harder to get her in and out of it and I HATED the plastic Bumbo tray that supposedly snapped in place..."""
__label__neg	I will replace it with a stainless  steel trash can
__label__pos	It has grooves so baby's head doesn't flop everywhere.
__label__neu	"""Surprizingly we dont have many gates, just 4, one for the top and bottom of each staircase."""
__label__neu	"Even on the front of the box it notes ""push to pop out - save your nails"" and ""clip to vacuum cord when cleaning - never lose it again"
__label__pos	We had to get some of these for the bottles
__label__neu	It does collapse, if the legs aren't snapped up properly; but otherwise isn't a problem.
__label__pos	"""We didn't even look at the directions and we figured it out!"""
__label__neg	"""I thought I would be receiving the iQ24, but I received a large size plastic container type thing that goes in the microwave."""
__label__pos	Jacques is such a good friend to my daughter.
__label__pos	"""This is one of those baby products!"""
__label__pos	We never had problems with leaking.
__label__pos	I've used it in a shopping cart and on a restaurant highchair and both went on with easy.
__label__neu	My baby was breast fed for the first 2 months.
__label__neu	Very VERY disappointing because I love the color and style!
__label__neu	Someone talked about this item not being sturdy
__label__neu	"""This swing has been used for all 3 of my little ones."""
__label__neg	 It didn't even stay on for a day
__label__pos	This is a great product
__label__neg	I am keeping 2 as they get the water out ok, others ended up in a garbage can.
__label__neu	I use Dr. Brown's - since those are pricey,  when I use up all of those,  I just use the Evenflo to store extra milk and pour it into the Dr. Brown's bottles.
__label__pos	I found it so nice to be able to offer my daughter bananas, grapes, potatoes, and so much more without having to worry about her taking in to big of a piece and choking.
__label__neu	We've moved into the upstairs bathtub, and I just place this inside the tub while our little guy kicks and splashes.
__label__pos	"""I couldn't wait to start solids on my bb...."""
__label__pos	I was also worried about the valve system, as he had a hard time using cups with valves, but he took to this sippy cup fabulously, and will not use any other cup.
__label__neg	I bought this tub without doing any research on it.
__label__neu	You can get new ones
__label__pos	"""Everything that I've complained about in the previous potty seats is addressed with the Baby Bjorn - it works fantastically!"""
__label__neu	"Cups made of unsafe PC plastic are usually clear and hard,  while cups made of safe PP plastic are softer and ""clouded"" plastic."
__label__neu	I have also never used the cooler.
__label__neu	Finally, after about 3 weeks of pain I decided to try this product.
__label__neg	It's quicker to just throw a blanket over the seat.
__label__neg	gets expensive(Diaper Dekor refill lasts forever -- like 2 months,  I think
__label__neu	At first,  it was (maybe a little less than a month),  odorless then after that, ...there was nothing to get rid of the scent.
__label__pos	"""The butterfly stays cold for at least an hour after taking it out of the freezer."""
__label__neg	"""In the end I think this chair is WAY overpriced for what it is..."""
__label__neu	There is also no trick to it.
__label__neu	Our daughter was just learning to walk when we moved in and as part of our baby-proofing we decided we needed something for the fireplace
__label__neg	They'd pull it out,  bang it a couple of times (starting up 2 different sounds) and then get bored and crawl away
__label__pos	"""we love all the sleepsack products & I was happy to find one in this size!"""
__label__pos	"""Either way I recommend it."""
__label__pos	That kind of interaction with your kid is priceless and I've already gotten my money out of pupsqueak in just a few weeks.
__label__neu	There is a lot less trash with the Dropins.
__label__pos	It was soft,  and when my child was sleeping he didn't pull it out
__label__pos	This seat is easy to clean, fairly easy to move from room to room, and versatile.
__label__pos	I LOVE it.
__label__neg	You get scared to run the batteries down b/c there are so many to replace and hard to get in and out.
__label__neu	This is the newer generation of this Safe Sippy and it seems ok to me!
__label__neu	 Plus once she was used to the pacifiers and nipples she wouldn't take any other kind
__label__neg	Yeah, she loves it when I take the bottle from her before she's done.
__label__pos	When our little one was newborn, it was easy and quick to swaddle her which made it nice.
__label__pos	It is also better if you are eating reading or writing because the baby rides much lower.
__label__neg	"I do enjoy the ""waterfall"" effect,  though honestly I wish I'd just purchased a cheaper blowup/plastic cover to start"
__label__neu	The last time I used it (so I could have a night out) it took me 3 attempts and over an hour of combined efforts to get 4 oz of milk (wouldn't you know,  she only drank 1/2 ounce.) Even when I would finally get a let down,  the action/suction wasn't enough to keep it going.
__label__pos	I especially love that I can plug it in instead of being stuck having to buy batteries every week like most all other swings.
__label__neg	 The bottle would sometimes be too hot and would leak at the top
__label__neu	He took the bottle immediately and didn't get NEARLY the amount of air
__label__pos	It's not overly expensive compared to some and the quality can't be beat.
__label__neu	When I first got Sophie in the mail, I had some buyers remorse because it did seem like a glorified dog toy.
__label__neu	I really wanted to use a manual grinder but after 2 months of using this one,  I think i am going to take another reviewer's recommendation and purchase a hand blender and use for the next few months.
__label__pos	No problems with this monitor!
__label__neg	We got so frustrated trying to get the wipes to dispense properly out of the top that we just gave up and opened the whole unit to get to them during changes.  
__label__neg	In all fairness I must update this review...I am a huge proponent of parents taking responsibility for their children and after further review we saw in the downloadable safety information on this chair that there is indeed a tipping possibility if the chair is on certain surfaces and if they can reach a certain part of the table.
__label__pos	since this product has such great reviews,  i did get a couple for some of my friends
__label__neg	 And no matter how we spun the thinkg we still ended up with one big bag of nasty diapers
__label__pos	A BIG must have for moms!
__label__neu	(It's only 100ft to the garbage  shoot outside the apartment).
__label__neg	 The flow is slower and it really does cut down on the amount of air she takes in during feedings
__label__neg	Why does everyone think you need this thing? 
__label__pos	This is almost a necessity when you purchase the Superyard XT.HINT: Do NOT buy two extensions, as the superyard becomes unstable with more than one set added (per manufacturers specifications).
__label__neu	"""Consider your phone."""
__label__pos	"""But she enjoys this one a lot more."""
__label__pos	Was a breeze to install and I feel really safe with the fact that it is a really great hardware mount. 
__label__neu	We looked all over the house looking for the source of the noise
__label__neg	I tried the other swings before ordering this one since I heard about the noise, and they all either make some type of clicking/moving sound due to the movement.
__label__neg	 As soon as i put another diaper in it unravels the first diaper and the second drops down with the first
__label__pos	FOR THE PRICE this stroller rocks my world!
__label__pos	"""It's easy to fold, lightweight and works wonderfully."""
__label__pos	The Chicco KeyFit is a very good seat.  
__label__neg	Check out Nicki's Diapers (google it) for much more selection and better prices.
__label__neu	The reviews are true
__label__neg	 It doesn't matter how you assemble them, or if you assemble them wet, or dry, or in space, or in a cave
__label__pos	Great to have on hand if you have toddlers.
__label__neu	The mattress is thin and we purchased a mattress for it for about $20.
__label__neu	She said babies today were going soft! 
__label__neu	The boy is at that stage where *everything* goes in his mouth - including lots of things I'd prefer didn't.  
__label__pos	Sophie is soft for my baby's gums and even though people say that the rubber smell bothers them, I like it. 
__label__neg	That was until the top rack kept falling down and this is WITHOUT glass bottles.
__label__neg	The only thing I don't like is that I can't turn off the music and leave the lights on.
__label__pos	This toy made it a little better though.  
__label__neg	 I eventually had to rent a hospital grade breast pump that worked
__label__neu	I would not recommend these unless you were going to hand wash them - but who has time with a new babe!
__label__pos	excellent chair
__label__neu	We found the most effective feeding design is the open airway used by Dr Browns bottles
__label__neu	I didn't get much use out of this b/c when it was time to switch over to our particular convertible car seat, there was no way to safely anchor the mirror as well (b/c a tether came over the top and side of the car seat to the anchor in back.)
__label__pos	I do highly recommend this.  
__label__neu	However,  these cheaper liners are smaller!
__label__neg	"""The only problem is that the Tri-flow is still fairly new and is very hard to find!"""
__label__neu	This bottle warmer never heated bottles evenly.
__label__neu	However, it cannot be worn on your back like some carriers can.  
__label__pos	The PISA is an amazing pump and the cost is equal to a few months of formula so my pump has already paid for itself (used for 6 months and still going strong)!
__label__neg	However, after owning it for 3 months, the top (where my head rests) was completely flat and I had to use a second pillow under my head
__label__neg	Well,  I decided I'd go without it since I don't feel like wasting $20 again
__label__pos	the relief was worth any minor inconvenience
__label__neg	 I'll let you know in Dec when baby arrives if they suddenly turn out to be utterly wonderful
__label__pos	"""I was using a mini electric to relieve the engorgement which was not working well at all."""
__label__neu	It is now two months later I put milk in the cup and began shaking it to make sure it was warmed throughout that I notice milk dripping from the spout.
__label__neg	I tried to use this tub for 3 times and returned it. 
__label__pos	It works GREAT!
__label__neg	 In the end we returned this seat to Amazon, and went to Babies R US to view the right model and bought from there
__label__pos	It is also great for keeping others from touching your baby when you don't want them to.
__label__pos	It can captivate them for 10+ minutes and often times we turn just the music on before we lay them down in their cribs to sleep which helps lull them (otherwise they may stare at the visuals too long and not go to sleep).
__label__neu	Anyway,  before I had the baby,  I bought my husband a bath head cushion (the kind you blow up) from Target which he never used (too girly I guess).
__label__pos	I took it everywhere with us, and it kept him entertained.
__label__neu	no offense)My son is now 5 1/2 months old and is nursing but also eats most solids including table foods when were out at a restaurant
__label__pos	This is my first review on Amazon, because I felt compelled to share my thoughts on this product. 
__label__neg	Folks, I am NOT kidding!
__label__neg	You do have to push a bit hard to make a solid impression in the material.
__label__neg	 We don't want to hurt our little one's ears
__label__neu	I took it back to the store and they said certain brands dont work in certain homes.  
__label__neg	not space efficient
__label__neu	So I bought the BRU teddy bear sponge to put inside the tub and he lays on that much better.
__label__pos	He seems quit content in it and hasn't complained. 
__label__neu	And yes, some wipes are not made for the top part that allows another wipe to pull out after.
__label__neg	 It is so much more soothing
__label__neu	I've gone through 3 bathing things so far - and this is my least favorite.
__label__pos	We bought this when on a roadtrip and have had no regrets.
__label__pos	I love the concept the ease of use and the fact that they fit like a glove.
__label__pos	"""I feel that my daughter is very safe in this seat."""
__label__neu	If you can get it for free,  get it.
__label__neg	 Didn't even use it once
__label__pos	It's extremely portable and fits into a small bag.
__label__pos	A great product.
__label__neu	Now I won't leave home without it.  
__label__pos	There are no instructions in the package, thankfully it's easy to figure out.
__label__pos	"""These pads have come in very handy."""
__label__pos	If I use this blanket with the Koddpotamus & Co 100% Cotton Knit SwaddleMe Blanket he stays swaddled all night!
__label__neu	"""We have 2 sets of twins, 8 months old and 3 years old."""
__label__pos	I got one and I love it the Gerber products smell sooo good and are gentle enough for everyday bathing!
__label__neg	 Maybe we just got a bad batch or something, but I hate these bottles. 
__label__pos	the colors are bold and won't chip. 
__label__neu	Instead we found a liquid tight pitcher.
__label__pos	I would recommend this to a friend and would purchase it again.
__label__pos	The video monitor saves alot of trips upstairs to check on the baby in the middle of the night - the extra sleep I get in my own bed makes this worth every penny!
__label__neg	However,  I do like the foot pedal for opening and it does hold a lot of diapers
__label__neu	Great colors,  and I like Simmons' contoured changing pad,  which this is supposed to fit,  but keep in mind that washing will significantly shrink the covers &amp; the terry fabric doesn't hold up well.
__label__neg	Bottom line this is not worth the money - the interference and feedback is way too much - even in a house with no other houses nearby. 
__label__pos	"""Buy this one!"""
__label__pos	Keeps wipes pretty moist.
__label__neu	We bought this for our infant carrier and it hangs very low and close to our baby's face.
__label__neu	It comes with storage containers and a nipple insert for smaller nipples.
__label__pos	Although it is small, it holds a ton of diapers -- so far we only have to empty it about once a week.
__label__neg	PS When I called TFY about my problems the lady just told me how to put it back together (that wasn't the problem) and got off the phone quickly with me. 
__label__neg	Even with the extra installation kit,  it was going to be a HUGE challenge
__label__pos	I recommend!
__label__pos	"""We haven't had any problem with the swinging (or lack thereof) that others seem to be having."""
__label__pos	Still, I wouldn't want to go a day without it!
__label__neu	After trying four different types of pacifiers,  my exclusively breastfed baby would only use this pacifier
__label__neu	I have 4 of them stocked on my changing table.  
__label__pos	"""This is by far the most attractive and easy to use gate of all that we bought."""
__label__neg	It's not long enough to reach the velcro on both sides
__label__pos	(His absolute favorite is ScratchEurope's Chicken Ball.)  
__label__pos	You can use this system with one hand. 
__label__neu	I think it's the massage feature that he likes so much
__label__pos	"""The side pockets are great for all my personal belongings since I don't care to also carry a purse these days."""
__label__neu	I'm sure most everyone either receives the Arrowhead or Sparkletts (or other) bottled water in their homes...well, the water is already at room tempreature...no need to 'warm' it up in the bottle warmer device...just add your formula in the bottle, shake and give to your baby! 
__label__neu	We never tried another carrier,  so I don't have a point of comparison,  but we hated this one so much,  that we brought it back to the store.
__label__neg	 It constantly pops off the tub whenever I put any weight on it. 
__label__neg	Cleaning the bottles was also a big pain.
__label__neu	She chews on it all the time.
__label__pos	This is the ONLY item I actually bought when I was pregnant,  as opposed to receiving it as a gift
__label__neg	This is far better than even thinking that I have this wonderful thing that is never supposed to smell.
__label__neu	In addition,  they easily strip,  even with the proper sized screwdriver!
__label__pos	"""It did its job, so I kept it."""
__label__neg	 That didn't work this motor is not powerful enough
__label__neu	"""She is now 7 months old and does not play in it so much (I keep it set up in the living room so she can crawl to it and play  when she wants) just yesterday I found her sitting up in there now playing with the butterflies!"""
__label__neu	What did our parents do besides clean up our messes?
__label__pos	I hate the Diaper Genie so I was excited to try this Diaper Champ out and I have to say I love it
__label__pos	"""We consider it a ""must-have."""""
__label__neu	Alas, I finally gave up and spent my cash on the active carrier to get the back support.
__label__neg	"""(2) The music the cow plays is super annoying."""
__label__neu	As long as you are careful how you place the top filtration piece- it should be fine.
__label__neg	Used this on our crib; lasted MAYBE 2 months
__label__neu	I don't think I will be switching from the Playtex Dropins I have been using.
__label__neg	I wish I hadn't spent the money.
__label__neu	Also,  I couldn't get the message cushion to work for me at all.
__label__neg	When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier. 
__label__neu	It's expensive and poorly designed.
__label__pos	I love how easy it is for him to grasp the rings and skinny bar in the middle.
__label__neu	The boppy body pillow (UGH! )
__label__neg	 This mirror was a big disappointment because it was totally useless for that purpose
__label__pos	It's very easy to use and the extra $10.00 spent on this one vs. the 9 channel model is well worth it considering that you get 3 times as many channels and a rechargeable battery on this one.
__label__neu	Now I only use it in her activity rocker as a pillow because she likes.
__label__neg	Never really fun
__label__neu	Does anyone else have that problem or do we just have a dud?
__label__neu	I guess I should expect that, given that it's a handheld manual pump. 
__label__pos	This is a great tub and a great value for the price.
__label__pos	Ultimately, they've basically replaced all the other blankets we were cycling through (at least until fall).
__label__neu	She sleeps in a bassinet in our room so we don't use it at night
__label__pos	It was wonderful.
__label__neg	 The top curve was in the way of my regular pillow and the bottom curve was never in the right spot if I had the long part of the pillow up against me
__label__neu	Now I remove the whole remaining stack and add new ones to the bottom.
__label__pos	 It doesn't feel sturdy but it is
__label__neg	I could still hear baby without the monitor when the monitor was beeping because it didn't get signal.
__label__neu	I think you would have to put this warmer in a steel case before placing it in your diaper bag in order for it not to activate itself!  
__label__pos	Due to its size, it lasts much longer, is much softer, and is a great product. 
__label__neu	It looks great,  but it's not sturdy at all.
__label__pos	My trio loved this thing and still will play with it, lol.
__label__neu	1
__label__pos	I love this pump.
__label__pos	"""As you can see I REALLY love this and so does my 1 month old daughter."""
__label__pos	I actually like these bottles and we use these for formula and avent for breastmilk, just out of habit.
__label__neu	Tissue will disintegrate when wet so please do not heed the previous reviewer's advice and use tissue instead.
__label__pos	There is also a head pillow so it holds the head especially when child is asleep. 
__label__neg	Not much fun as a stationary entertainer-- not enough for baby to do, and many of the toys are repetitive. 
__label__pos	It is extremely user-friendly.  
__label__neu	Other times he'll grab one leg in each hand and chew on the giraffe's ears.  
__label__neu	ALTERNATIVE USE.
__label__neu	It also was hard to wash his privates as he was sitting on his bottom and you can't just lift him to wash it and his front privates were to squashy to get to.
__label__pos	"""My daughter loves this mobile."""
__label__neu	We had the old square model where the inner lids in the pail are round and fold to the inside of the pail (that is the model in this picture).
__label__pos	"""We love our Zanzibar set and have received many compliments on it."""
__label__pos	This kit represents overall good value in terms of the contents, since a single digital thermometer costs ...
__label__neg	I'm very disapointed because I've generally liked the First Years products
__label__neg	Oh,  and it also has a hook that makes it super easy for the child to hang it up after use
__label__pos	We couldn't ask for anything more!
__label__neg	We have this positioner in the porta crib and the Air Flow positioner in the bassinet.
__label__pos	"""It has good sound quality, picks up the smallest noises, which is good and bad depending on how soundly you sleep :-)The feature that i like best, (which is actually why i am buying another one now that mine is broken)is that it has 2 ON settings."""
__label__neu	REVIEW
__label__pos	"""It works great if I need to put him in his crib to get something done for a few minutes and sometimes I use it during the day for naptime because it is already bright in the room."""
__label__pos	While it was working it worked well and I liked being able to have one hand free while pumping.
__label__neg	Before ordering it I read other reviews and noticed that many parents complain that the zipper does not go all the way up - I agree it doesn't.
__label__neg	 Then the picture got all fuzzy
__label__neg	Unfortunately I was suckered in to all the hype about the Dr. Brown's bottles.
__label__pos	The sling on this tub is so helpful when bathing a newborn...
__label__neg	(Also, this doesn't have a refrigerated compartment, which is important if you're carrying stored breastmilk)
__label__pos	The noises are great and I love using it as a speaker for my ipod.
