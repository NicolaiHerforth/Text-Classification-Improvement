__label__neu	 What she means is that her feet are tingling and going to sleep. 
__label__neg	 Then she doesn't want to get off because her legs are numb and she gets scared. 
__label__neg	 She is not a big girl but this seat is just too uncomfortable for her. 
__label__neg	 Also, every time she gets up the insert sticks to her behind and will dump if there is anything in it. 
__label__neg	 It also leaves her with a red ring around her butt. 
__label__neu	 I am going to look for a cushioned potty chair next and hopefully we have more success.
__label__neu	I used this when I became too sore to use my electric pump. 
__label__neg	 The milk seeps under the pump guard and it leaks out from the edges onto clothes. 
__label__neg	I wouldn't even say getting this as a pump for when you're on the go is a good idea because the leaking milk will get all over leaving you with clean up. 
__label__neg	I had to buy a replacement part because the bottom part that screws on the base of the pump cracked from sterilizing (which it says you can do). 
__label__neg	 They don't sell just that one little piece so I had to buy the actual pump again as a part. 
__label__neg	 It cost nearly $30 to order this part and it took over 2 weeks to receive it. 
__label__neg	 The entire system just isn't durable or made for much use. 
__label__neg	 Also, cleaning down into the bend of this pump thoroughly is practically impossible.
__label__neu	When I was pregnant and shopping for the nursery, I was torn between what type of bumper to buy. 
__label__neu	One one hand I liked the softness of the Carter's brand bumper, but I liked the breathable bumper because my daughter was born in the beginning of summer and I wanted her to stay as cool as possible; so I bought the breathable bumper. 
__label__pos	When I put it on the crib, it looked very nice and while my daughter was little and imobile, it was very useful. 
__label__neg	As soon as she began to roll around, about 4 months, I would wake in the night to screams...her litttle arms and legs would get caught in the spacing of the crib, up and over the bumper! 
__label__neg	She would roll and turn while sleeping and apparently her limbs would lift over the bumper and the bumper would crumble under the light pressure of a babies arm. 
__label__pos	I have since bought the Carter's brand bumper and I am happy. 
__label__pos	It stands up to her limbs and no more limbs get caught. 
__label__neu	Great idea, but bumper needs work.
__label__neu	My newborn is a very aggressive sucker, and would gulp her bottles down as quickly as she could, choking and coughing so frequently that it made ME anxious every time I had to feed her. 
__label__neg	These nipples were supposedly better than the regular nipples that came with the Evenflo glass bottles, but I personally did not like them (saw NO difference in function between this and regular nipples). 
__label__neg	IF YOU HAVE AN AGGRESSIVE EATER WHO THEN SUFFERS WITH GAS, GET THE BORN FREE BOTTLES AND NIPPLES - YOU (AND YOUR BABY) WILL BE MUCH HAPPIER!
__label__neg	We tried this one out since all the reviews I read were so good but unfortunately, we were not pleased with it. 
__label__neu	 When you plug it into the wall it seems to have a lot of static and it doesn't seem to matter where in the house you try it. 
__label__neg	 Don't waste your money...
__label__neg	Very useful if you can transport it without clicking the disc that activates the warming solution, and if you do it is useless if you are somewhere without a stove and a pot of boiling water. 
__label__pos	 But it does warm bottles really well, just have to learn to be extra careful with it.
__label__neu	I love that these are made with safer materials but beware that they absolutely leak! 
__label__neg	 Pretty much everytime we use it there is a nice milk ring or water ring on the table. 
__label__neg	This makes the cup virtually useless for me because I bought it so my son could carry it around the house without spilling all over the place! 
__label__neg	 Okay, it doesn't gush, but it definitely drips enough and to me, dripping milk or even water all over the house is not okay. 
__label__neg	 I expected better quality for the high price.
__label__neg	As the other reviews have noted, this cup holder does not hold drinks well. 
__label__neg	 I tend to use it for hot drinks, especially this time of year, and I can't put the drinks in the holder until they're more than half empty -- otherwise they'll spill everywhere. 
__label__neg	 If you intend to use this cup holder on any sort of sidewalk with any drink that doesn't have a tightly closed lid, it won't work:  Any bounce from the sidewalk, and your drink will spray down the side of the stroller. 
__label__neg	I haven't had any trouble with the chains breaking yet in the six weeks I've been using it, but the construction does seem flimsy, so I can see where that might happen in future. 
__label__neg	 The flip-up design enabled by the chains is a nice idea in theory, but doesn't work in practice. 
__label__neg	Interestingly, my cup holder came with a warning sticker on the bottom that you're not supposed to use it with hot drinks -- I guess this is UPPAbaby's acknowledgement that the design doesn't work because it spills and thus could be dangerous with hot drinks. 
__label__neg	 But why waste money on a cup holder that will only hold some of the drinks you take along? 
__label__neu	 It makes more sense to buy something that securely holds any drink you might want, instead. 
__label__neu	 I'm going to be replacing it with the Jolly Jumper caddy.
__label__neu	I regret not following the advice of the majority of reviewers on this one. 
__label__neg	These really are terrible sheets. 
__label__pos	I have the Graco Cubby Parade Pack N Play and figured the sheets would be good since they're manufactured by the same company. 
__label__neu	Boy was I wrong. 
__label__neg	They don't fit the pad very well regardless if it's laying flat for the playpen or if it's set up for the bassinet. 
__label__neg	Since the bassinet is 3/4 the pad folds up and the sheet doesn't stay put very well at all. 
__label__neg	They are also cheaply made. 
__label__neg	Thin isn't even the word. 
__label__neg	It's upsetting that my Babies r Us only carries this brand. 
__label__neg	I'm going to return the rest for a store credit and try to find a suitable replacement elsewhere. 
__label__neu	As for now I am currently using my bassinet w/o a sheet. 
__label__pos	The pad wipes down well and if i'm going to have my daughter in there for a long time I use a waterproof pad under her. 
__label__neu	Since she's always wrapped in a blanket she doesn't mind going w/o the sheet.
__label__pos	Contrary to other reviewers, I prefer the Diaper Genie to both the Diaper Champ and the Diaper Dekor, in part because of superior containment of smell. 
__label__pos	As one reviewer notes, there are a number of steps involved, but they're easy to learn, become second nature, and most importantly they *work*. 
__label__neu	We actually have to Genies, one of the earlier model and one of the purportedly new and improved Diaper Genie. 
__label__neg	The latter model, however, is not an improvement. 
__label__neu	The redesign allows the bag inside to be turned using the closed lid rather than by holding the bag on the inside. 
__label__neg	But the lid won't twist the bag if there's isn't much weight (at least 4 diapers or so) in it, which means it does a poorer job of containing the smell *and* occasionally makes a mess of the bag when you try to cut it (by pressing a button on the lid while twisting). 
__label__neg	The old design has one main problem: That inner ring that used to be used to hold and twist the bag, which is softer plastic, rubs against the bag/refill package, which is harder plastic. 
__label__neg	Over time (2 years, in our case) the bottom edge of the inner ring has worn and warped from collision and abrasion with the refill package, and has become quite difficult to enter. 
__label__neu	But I'm planning to sand it down a bit, which will probably resolve things - and THAT will be our preferred new and improved Genie.
__label__neg	This is a piece of garbage. 
__label__neg	 once you get it under the chair, you can't scoot the chair up to the table. 
__label__neg	 if you want to use it as a booster when needed it's very clumsy, spring loaded, breakable (cheap plastic breaks) and it's too much of a pain to put under the chair and take away. 
__label__neg	 so if you buy this, plan to use it as a permanent fixture under your chair, scooted all the way up to the table, because it is virtually un-moveable once you get it in place. 
__label__neg	 a real pain in the neck. 
__label__neg	 oh, and it's not portable. 
__label__neg	(as in, if you're traveling)  it's very big and bulky when folded and doesn't stay folded. 
__label__neu	 it's huge. 
__label__neu	 if you packed this on a carry-on (on an airplane) you wouldn't have much room for anything else, so it's not meant to be portable. 
__label__neg	 overall, it's a piece of junk. 
__label__pos	 Great concept though. 
__label__pos	 would be nice if it worked.
__label__neg	This has a loud, annoying squeak and does really bounce all that well. 
__label__pos	My MIL bought it for a visit and ours (Graco) is much, much better. 
__label__pos	We've had no problems with safety issues.
__label__neg	It's too bad I didn't know how impossible it would be to get the lids off before I had stored a week's worth of milk on these. 
__label__neg	Neither my husband or I could get the tops off... 
__label__neu	even using screwdrivers and various other tools to try to pry them off. 
__label__neu	The only one that came open was the one that dropped on the tile floor as I pulled it out of the freezer, of course, it only came open because the container cracked and the milk cube went flying across the kitchen floor... 
__label__pos	our dog loved his treat!
__label__neg	The way baby is positioned in this carrier causes spinal compression. 
__label__neu	 I have read that it is not good for baby to be facing out (difficult or impossible for them to block out all of the stimulation, unable to see parent's face to help them interpret situations). 
__label__neg	 I found this carrier to be incredibly uncomfortable- hurt my back and shoulders after 10 minutes of use. 
__label__pos	 We ended up getting an Ergo and are much happier with it. 
__label__neg	 Would recommend using a sling with an infant.
__label__neu	I'm updating my review on this product. 
__label__pos	 After using some other brands of bottle brush, I'm going to give this one 4 stars. 
__label__neu	 This is because the sponge on this brush is denser than on other brushes. 
__label__pos	 A denser sponge holds soap better. 
__label__neg	 I found that when using other brands of brush, I went through soap much more quickly. 
__label__pos	 The denser sponge on this brush also lathers the inside of the bottle much better than other brands too, which means cleaner bottles in less time. 
__label__neu	 This brush still has a durability issue, however, I've come to the conclusion that it's probably a good idea to throw out bottle brushes every few weeks anyway. 
__label__pos	 I'm going back to this brush!(Old review below)Purchased this brush to use on my Dr. 
__label__neu	Brown's bottles. 
__label__neu	 I don't have a dishwasher so I use it every day. 
__label__pos	 The brush works well and cleans both the bottom and the neck of the bottle. 
__label__neg	 Unfortunately, mine have only lasted about 2 months because the sponge starts to break apart. 
__label__neu	 I'm on my second one. 
__label__neu	 I thought I had been to hard on the first one, so I was nicer to my second one. 
__label__neg	 But it still is falling apart. 
__label__neg	 Won't be buying another.
__label__neg	These sheets are incredibly thin and cheap. 
__label__neg	The elastic isn't good, and the fabric is just not soft. 
__label__neu	We've bought several other brands, all of which were better than this stuff.
__label__neu	We initially really liked the changing pad, but after about a week's worth of regular use (5-8 times a day) the outside ripped where the velcro is sewn in. 
__label__neg	We also found that the plastic that the baby is changed on stains very easily. 
__label__neg	It's a good size, but poor quality, someone didn't think the design through
__label__neu	I had to switch to bottles because of low milk production and having to supplement soon after my son was born. 
__label__neu	 I love the look and feel of avent bottles but my son has a small mouth and was unable to get a good suction on this nipple. 
__label__neg	 He would leak milk everywhere or squirt it at us, it was very messy. 
__label__neu	 Therefore I had to switch very quickly to playtex standard bottles. 
__label__neu	I also don't recommend buying many 4oz bottles, my son drank less than four ounces for only about 6 weeks and he was up to 5 ounces, and it is a pain to have to fix two bottles.
__label__neu	I purchased the Select-a-Show-Soother for my 6 month old Grandson. 
__label__neg	Unless you have a very light painted room and ceiling, don't bother purchasing this product. 
__label__neu	The designs will not show up on dark walls and even if your ceiling is painted white, the images are still fuzzy. 
__label__neu	It is also perplexing to find a place to sit this product AND allow the baby to actually see the designs that will show up on the ceiling/wall. 
__label__neg	There should be more slides that come with the product or the availability to purchase more slides according to the baby's age. 
__label__pos	The good points of this product are that it tilts so that one can TRY to find a space for the lights to project and you have 4 choices of music to choose from. 
__label__pos	The music is soothing.
__label__neg	My daughter was small, but this really seemed very cumbersome to use. 
__label__neu	 Didn't really see the need for this-a much better buy that my mother insisted on was the harness pillow for support.
__label__neg	This was one of three diaper pails I tried while my daughter was in diapers, and my least favorite of the three. 
__label__neg	 Sure, the idea of twisting the diapers into their own little sausage-like casings seems appealing, but all that twisting led to some real issues with my elbow - very painful. 
__label__neg	 And the hefty price you have to pay for the replacement bags...what a rip-off! 
__label__pos	 I ended up using the Diaper Champ and was really happy with that diaper pail - no special bags required and all you do is drop the diaper in and flip the handle over.
__label__pos	This pillow is great for sitting your baby on your lap or for letting him nap on your lap. 
__label__pos	 It's even better to prop your baby up with for tummy time or to sit. 
__label__neg	 It's not great however for nursing. 
__label__neg	 I talked to a lactation consultant and found that the Boppy was NEVER designed to be a nursing pillow. 
__label__neg	 It was terrible for my back. 
__label__neg	 I couldn't get our baby aligned properly which was very stressful just starting out nursing. 
__label__neu	 I had to prop pillows under both sides to try to get it right. 
__label__neu	 At my lactation appointment they had a My Brest Friend pillow. 
__label__pos	 This pillow is fantastic. 
__label__neu	 It keeps the baby aligned properly with your breast. 
__label__pos	 Which makes it so much easier to get your baby latched on correctly. 
__label__neu	 I have a My Brest Friend at home and in my car for going out. 
__label__pos	 I have been successfully nursing for going on 9 months now. 
__label__neg	 I would never have gotten this far with the Boppy. 
__label__neg	 Please, try the My Brest Friend instead.*For nursing I give this pillow a rating of 1 star. 
__label__pos	 However, as a pillow to prop your baby for tummy time or to sit up I give this pillow a 4 star rating. 
__label__neu	 All together a rating of 3 stars.*
__label__neg	This thing is cheap and flimsy. 
__label__neg	 The picture looked better, but I was disappointed when I put it together. 
__label__neu	 It held up moderately for a couple of months. 
__label__neg	 Now the top part won't stay in place. 
__label__neg	 Despite it falling apart on us, I just haven't found it very easy to use. 
__label__neg	 all the small parts wind up in the middle where it is harder to get to them. 
__label__neu	 Of course, we use glass bottles so there is more weight on the parts than if we used plastic, but the top part is where we put the bottle tops, nipples, etc. 
__label__neu	 That shouldn't break it. 
__label__neu	 Oh well, I am online shopping for a replacement now. 
__label__neg	 This one just didn't hold up for us.
__label__neg	This thing is junk and a waste of space. 
__label__neg	It does not twist correctly. 
__label__neg	The inside also smells like pee and poop no matter how much I clean it. 
__label__neg	Don't waste the money.
__label__pos	Pros:They ARE really soft!!They are a sustainable material. 
__label__pos	They are a good size for a wipe. 
__label__pos	They have great tooth for grabbing the poo. 
__label__neg	Cons:Can't dry them in dryer: (But who's gonna separate 30+ small wipes before drying, and risk missing one and ruining it! 
__label__neg	 Absurd.)If you do put them in the dryer, they DO unravel. 
__label__neu	 Trust the reviews. 
__label__neg	Air/sun drying them leaves them super stiff. 
__label__neu	The corners roll up over time from shrinking. 
__label__neg	Personally, I HATE these wipes. 
__label__neg	 They're useless. 
__label__neg	 Now they've shrunk so small I can't even use them as cleaning rags. 
__label__neu	 (They're like 4x4 now!)
__label__pos	Never, ever buy from this company. 
__label__neg	 They have the worse customer service I have ever dealt with. 
__label__neg	They are the only company that will completely ignore emails, phone calls, etc.
__label__neu	The product I received is not the one pictured. 
__label__neg	 It has completely different colors and the starfish is funky ... 
__label__neg	which is NOT what I wanted. 
__label__pos	 However, it is quite a bit larger than I expected, which is a plus I guess. 
__label__neg	 But I am just disappointed I didn't get what was being advertised and cannot return it as it was a gift. 
__label__neu	 I know the baby won't care... 
__label__neg	but it really is ugly.
__label__neu	I can't wear this item for more than 30 min. 
__label__neg	at a time b/c it hurts my back so bad! 
__label__neu	I've never had back problems, so that's not the issue. 
__label__neg	It just doesn't have any back support. 
__label__neg	Save the $20!
__label__neg	For me these were a waste of money. 
__label__neu	I used the adhesive tape only. 
__label__neg	The tape is not like the easily removable 3M tape so removing the locks and adhesive residue is difficult. 
__label__neu	Only two (seldom used) cabinets are still working. 
__label__neu	This is an Ikea cabinet so maybe the locks fit the modern design well. 
__label__neu	The other seven locks were installed in the kitchen and bathroom which have old cabinets. 
__label__neg	The locks simply do not catch. 
__label__neu	It is as if the angle of the door closing means the locks and catches do not line up properly. 
__label__neu	One cabinet worked well but my toddler pulled on it hard enough to break the adhesive. 
__label__neu	I considered re-installing it using the screws but just went for a simple door handle lock (I had to change the cabinet handles from knobs to D-shaped ones). 
__label__neu	I feel like I might be doing something wrong but there is another sort of lock I installed successfully on drawers which I could not install in the bathroom cabinet. 
__label__neu	It seems the angle of the door closing means the locks and catches do not line up properly. 
__label__neu	Whereas drawers open and close in the straight line.
__label__neu	I had this seat for about 2.5 years. 
__label__pos	 At first, I loved it. 
__label__neu	 Then the straps started getting harder and harder to adjust. 
__label__neg	 It would take both my husband and I pulling on it to get them to budge and even then we could not get them tight enough to really be considered safe. 
__label__pos	 I called Britax  (they have the best customer service), I explained my situation and they agreed to replace my seat free of charge with either a Marathon or Boulvard. 
__label__pos	 I chose the Boulevard and I am so happy that I did. 
__label__pos	 It is a fantastic seat and I would highly recommend that anyone looking at this seat consider the Boulevard instead. 
__label__pos	 It is only slightly  more expensive but it is much nicer. 
__label__pos	 I also have the Regent which is another fantastic seat and I would highly recommend that seat to anyone with room in their car (because it is huge) and with a child over the age of 1 - it is forward facing only. 
__label__neu	 Britax is the best but unfortunately there is a design flaw in this seat in the way that the buckle is made.
__label__neg	I use this for less than 1 month: The quality of the material (plasitc) is bad and cheap, it doesnt control de odor ( the room really stinks) and it broked after a month of use, and the refills cost too much money! 
__label__pos	I definetly go with the diaper champ, better odor control, no refill bags ( use conventional kitchen trash bags).
__label__pos	We registered online for this bag because we thought it was stylish. 
__label__neu	 Little did we know that it is really hard to find anything in this bag because of all the little tiny zipper compartments and the main compartment only zips down the side so you have to take everything out of the bag to actually see what you are looking for. 
__label__neg	 It's really hard to do all of that when you are out with your baby!
__label__neu	My daughter loves baths & bubbles so we got this...but it came with only a small amount of bubble mix. 
__label__neu	 THe catch -- do not use dish soap to fill OR regular bubble mix...so you've gotta use their special mixture to refill bubbles. 
__label__neu	 We went through the whole container of bubble mix in less ten a week. 
__label__neg	 I tried a few other bubble mixes and they didn't seem to make the bubbles as nicely. 
__label__neg	 Then it stalled...so overall...a good idea...but it doesn't last.
__label__neg	This item is SO frustrating. 
__label__neg	 What would seem to be a very easy toy to put together cost me over an hour of wasted time. 
__label__neg	 The seat was not made correctly and I could not get it to fit on the frame. 
__label__neg	 I spent a half hour trying to get it on and then a half hour driving it back to Babies R Us. 
__label__neu	 I am going to see if the store has another one and put it together before I leave the store!
__label__neg	these bottles are not worth the money.. 
__label__neg	they are so complicated to put together and they always leak. 
__label__neg	my daughter could not drink one bottle without spilling the formula out of the sides. 
__label__pos	please think about using another bottle, I suggest dr browns , i threw away all my ventaire once i purchased the dr browns bottles &#62; they are definitely the best on the market.
__label__neu	I registered for and received these Medela bags. 
__label__neu	 After using all 50, I got a few free Lansinoh bags with my breast pad purchase. 
__label__pos	 Wow!! 
__label__neg	I will never go back to Medela. 
__label__pos	 The reason I registered for them is because everyone says they are strong and don't leak. 
__label__neg	 Well this is the only good feature. 
__label__pos	 The Lansinoh bag is strong as well, easy to close (DOUBLE zip-lock Vs. 
__label__pos	Medela's bothersome twisty ties), easy to get the air out (unlike Medela's), and the Lansinoh's take-up WAY less room in the freezer! 
__label__neg	Stacking Medela bags in the freezer is difficult because of their shape...and thawing will be difficult because I can see I'll need to watch that the milk doesn't spill out the top. 
__label__pos	 With Lansinoh I won't have to worry about that. 
__label__neu	 My medela bags haven't split in the freezer... 
__label__pos	I'll give them that. 
__label__neu	 But neither has my Lansinoh bag.
__label__neg	this tub leaks - i had to put it in my bath tub to use it, which really hurt my back and made me nervous when taking my daughter out of the tub and trying to stand up. 
__label__neg	 couldnt use it on a kitchen counter unless i wanted everything to get wet.doesnt open and close very easily -  i gave myself more than one bruise (due to pinched skin) when trying to open and close it. 
__label__neu	 also, by the time your child can sit up in this might as well put them in the big tub..my daughter slipped and slid all over when we tried to sit her up.too short - by the time she was 4 months, she was too long for this tub and would kick the sides.i had regisered for the eurotub, but rec'd this. 
__label__pos	 preferred the euortub by far!
__label__neg	This tub was the worst! 
__label__neg	Talk about making your job harder than it already is! 
__label__neg	It leaks, the sling hardly stays in place, it takes up so much space, and you have to use it in the tub anyways. 
__label__neg	It is more trouble than it is worth.
__label__neg	The AC adaptor and sound selections are great, but the sound is way too low, even on the highest level. 
__label__neg	I foolishly bought this, knowing that others thought it was too low...but it really is SO LOW you can't hear it 4 feet away. 
__label__neg	Turned out to be a 20 buck paperweight for me.
__label__neg	I didn't like this blanket really at all. 
__label__neg	 It definitely wraps your baby up tight but the way it holds their arms so tightly next to their sides it almost seems like a straight jacket! 
__label__neg	 It can also be quite warm or hot and that worries me. 
__label__pos	 We preferred the Kiddopotumus swaddle blanket.
__label__neg	This cup is a FABULOUS idea, too bad it leaks so horribly. 
__label__neg	 It doesn't leak from the mouth piece - it leaked from the bottom!
__label__neu	I can see that it would be comfortable but it was easier to bathe without this bulky item.... 
__label__neg	Would not suggest.
__label__neg	While I'm a stubborn Anglophile, I'm very disappointed by Avent's products. 
__label__neg	 The bottles are not comfortable for people with small hands (or stubby fingers) to hold, and the worst part is with the nipples, which are made of semi-hard plastic and too large for young babies. 
__label__neu	 I think Dr. 
__label__pos	Brown's or the Playtex Ventaire is way better. 
__label__pos	 Even Gerber's one-use disposable nipples are way better.
__label__neg	This montior does work well. 
__label__neu	I can hear my son breathing, and dogs barking and all of that very clearly. 
__label__pos	It works outside, upstairs and down. 
__label__neg	The problem is that I am spending a small fortune in batteries. 
__label__neg	When you plug it in it gets all fuzzy and has this terrible buzzing sound. 
__label__neu	I have tried both monitors and all the plugs in the house. 
__label__neg	So I have to replace the battery every day to use it through the whole night and that gets pretty expensive.
__label__neu	I was so excited about this product it being 100% polycarbonate-free and all that, but my baby did not share my excitement. 
__label__neg	 She would take it because i put it in her mouth, but she would cry and turn away. 
__label__neu	 I tried a number of times over a 3 week time frame but she refused. 
__label__pos	 So I had to settle for playtex dropins so far, no problems.
__label__neg	My son is 6 months old and can barely reach the floor. 
__label__neu	 He is normal height and weight, but has a longer upper body (like me!)  I bought this thinking that since you can adjust the height, it would work. 
__label__neu	 The lowest setting is still slightly too high. 
__label__neg	 Not impressed. 
__label__neg	 Kinda boring. 
__label__neg	 Maybe we can start using it in a few weeks, but for now, I wish I had bought something else.
__label__neg	Waste my $$$!!.. 
__label__neg	Can fit but water keep leaking out fr the rubber ring.. 
__label__neg	Cannot return because it is openedI am stuck with it.. 
__label__pos	but I like the hippo.. 
__label__neg	kinda cuteWont recommend to anyone
__label__neu	We bought this for a trip I was taking by myself with my large, 34 inch tall 16 month old. 
__label__neu	 I installed it correctly and put my son in it. 
__label__neu	 It was very easy to install, but the red strap that fits around the seat was directly behind his head, making him keep his head forward. 
__label__neg	 Also, as another reviewer stated, the chest strap was right under his chin, which I feared would decapitate him in an accident. 
__label__neg	 Because there is no middle strap between the child's legs like in a carseat, they do slide down and the chest strap is literally at their neck. 
__label__neg	 I even brought drawer liner with us and put it under my son's bum to keep him from sliding out, but it didn't help. 
__label__neg	Lastly, the airplane seatbelt (we flew on American) didn't get tight enough to really keep him in place. 
__label__neu	 He's a large child and at 26 pounds is way over the minimum weight of 20 lbs. 
__label__neg	 I cannot imagine using this with a smaller child. 
__label__neu	I ended up bringing his carseat on with us and using that on the flight back. 
__label__neg	 I will be selling my CARES and getting this instead for next time. 
__label__pos	Go Go Kidz TravelMate - Black/ Orange
__label__neg	I really liked the Medela products at first, but I never really liked these bags, mainly because you have to tie them with a folded over twist tie to close them. 
__label__neg	 If you get too much milk in the bag, it will leak when you close it up. 
__label__neg	 Then one of my bags tipped over in the freezer and it leaked, causing a frozen puddle of breast milk in my brand new freezer to clean. 
__label__neg	 Plus, the bag got stuck in the puddle. 
__label__pos	I have also used the Gerber bags, and I liked those much better.
__label__neu	This item is serviceable and probably something you could buy to use to basically get ruined without stressing about it. 
__label__pos	 The Wendy Bellisimo changing pad covers are only $2 more and much better quality fabric. 
__label__neg	 The terry used for these is very cheap and scratchy, like an old towel. 
__label__neg	 I am using them but am not fussed on how long they last or what happens to them, I won't be buying any more though. 
__label__pos	 Carter's also makes lap pads that are great for use over the changing pad. 
__label__neu	 You don't strictly speaking need a cover, it's easier if you don't use one. 
__label__pos	 I never used covers with DD and never had a problem.
__label__neg	If you are using this as a trainer cup, to move your child to the sippy, do not buy. 
__label__neg	The spout is too small. 
__label__neg	I like the THINK BABY bottle much more. 
__label__neg	I wish they would have made the spout larger.
__label__pos	I tried these pads first after being so happy with other Avent products. 
__label__neg	Unlike other Avent products these pads are barely passable for the job. 
__label__neg	They are very thick, you can see them through clothing, the diameter is far too small so even a small shift and they will leak. 
__label__neu	After many leaks with these I switched to Lansinoh pads.
__label__neu	Purchased two in case one got lost. 
__label__neg	One squeaker was defective. 
__label__neg	 The paint job on each was poorly executed--especially around the ears. 
__label__neg	 Rubber threads trailed from the top of one. 
__label__pos	 Very cute face, though. 
__label__pos	Also softer head and body than Sophie. 
__label__pos	Ears are a nice size for smaller mouths to nibble on. 
__label__pos	 Easier to squeeze than Sophie. 
__label__neg	 Too bad it isn't made as well as Sophie. 
__label__pos	 We're sticking with Sophie.
__label__neg	With all the baby accidents on the clothing that gets put into this hamper, it gets a bit gamey. 
__label__neu	 So I washed it, in cold water and didn't put it in the dryer. 
__label__neg	 Well, it shrank so bad that it no longer reaches the bottom of the legs so you can velcro it. 
__label__neg	 I ended up tossing it. 
__label__neg	 You can't put a bedding change in it with anything else in there, it just doesn't have enough room and the frame is very cheaply made I was afraid it would break. 
__label__neg	 Not worth it.
__label__neg	I didn't like these for a few reasons. 
__label__neg	They take up too much room in my freezer. 
__label__neg	They take too long to thaw. 
__label__neg	I don't care for the avent isis pump. 
__label__pos	I have been using the gerber freezer bags instead and I can freeze my milk flat and it thaws much quicker.
__label__neg	I can't believe all the great reviews. 
__label__neg	Maybe its just me, but I think this pump is so overrated. 
__label__pos	The pluses: it is small, it does work OK sometimes. 
__label__neg	The negatives: it takes a long time to pump even a small amount, it has a lot of parts. 
__label__neg	And the worst one is that the plastic star valve keeps coming off, which requires taking it apart in the middle of pumping,while its leaking everywhere. 
__label__neg	I rented the Medela for 2 months before using it and believe me this thing does not compare, not even close. 
__label__neg	I use it only occasionally and it drives me crazy even than. 
__label__neg	There has to be a better hand pump out there. 
__label__neu	This is my personal opinion, so your resluts could be totally different
__label__neu	We got our gate about 5 years ago. 
__label__neu	 We used it about a year with our second child. 
__label__neu	 Well our third is now crawling and we just put it up again. 
__label__neg	 After 3 days up our lock froze in the stuck position. 
__label__neu	 I was about to buy the exact same gate since I was pretty happy with it before and I thought the age was the problem until I read the reviews. 
__label__neg	 This is a problem that needs to be fixed by the manufacture. 
__label__neu	 I'll be looking for a new gate now!
__label__neu	The sling option was nice for my newborn baby, but, as he got bigger I had to remove the sling because there was a big hump of plastic jabbing him in the back. 
__label__neg	Troubles started when he was an infant, his little body squirmed all over and I had to wrestle to keep his head up and not falling into the water and body from sliding. 
__label__neu	I would skip this tub and use bathe a newborn in the sink and then invest in a Primo tub. 
__label__pos	That is what I ended up  buying and it is WONDERFUL.
__label__neu	My son was 7 lbs 1 oz when he was born and 20 inches long... 
__label__neu	He wasnt the tiniest baby... 
__label__neu	I tried putting him in the sling and it just looks like he's falling and being enveloped by this huge orange thing... 
__label__neg	It's the WORST product ever, I am definitely NOT using it and will probably donate it to goodwill...
__label__neg	I just bought this toy because it was the only one I could find in the store for a stroller.. 
__label__neg	And of course it won't fit on our Graco stroller.
__label__neg	I did not find this item to be very comfortable at all! 
__label__neg	 Maybe I am too petite for this item but it was not very plyable at all and became far too cumbersome. 
__label__neg	 It just took up a great deal of space in the bed and was too hard and thick to use under my head. 
__label__neg	 Furthermore, it did not supply enough back support so I prefered to use a heatable neck pillow to support my back. 
__label__neu	 Honestly, you would be better served to purchase a bolster pillow for between your knees and a heatable (chamomile or lavender) beanbag pillow. 
__label__neu	 Spend the fifty dollars on your baby instead!
__label__neg	I do not advise getting this gate if you plan on putting it up and taking it down often. 
__label__neg	 It's a hassle to secure in place, and most times it is pretty flimsy if you can't get it's spring locks to lock into place. 
__label__neg	 It's also difficult to get a good grip on the smooth, teeny handles that you need to twist to lock/set it. 
__label__neg	 And sometimes it's almost impossible to unlock it to take it down, and you just have to pull it out from the doorway. 
__label__neg	Only really good for rolling/crawling children; Definitely AVOID this gate if your child is starting to pull up onto things, or is up walking around. 
__label__neg	It would probably give way if a child tried climbing, leaning, or pulling on it. 
__label__neg	Not very good at all; definitely not worth the price. 
__label__neg	 You could find something much better for around the same cost.
__label__neu	My son is now 11 months old and I have been using this tub since he was 5 weeks old. 
__label__neg	 In the beginning, we used the infant sling, but my baby would constantly slip down into the water. 
__label__neg	 We had to put a large bear-shaped foam bath sponge between him and the sling to minimize the slipping, but we still had to readjust him quite frequently. 
__label__neu	 When he learned to sit on his own, we tried using the bath seat feature. 
__label__neg	 He would arch his back and slip forward into the bath ring, thus painfully squishing his private parts. 
__label__neu	 We decided to try it without the ring and it was a little challenging holding him in place while washing him, but we managed. 
__label__neg	 Now he twists and turns and won't stay put in the tub. 
__label__neu	 I have thought about buying a better tub, but since we are so close to graduating him to the big tub, I don't want to spend the money. 
__label__neg	 Please consider buying something different for your baby. 
__label__neg	 I will not be using this tub for my next child.
__label__pos	This item is one I have seen time and again on new mom's baby registries. 
__label__pos	I had this one and it worked for all of three months. 
__label__neg	we never really used it because just holding them in your had for  a minute really does the trick and you can save the twenty dollar item on something you really need and something that is actually useful. 
__label__neg	I have 4 sisters all of whom registered for this and all of them got everything on their registries but this item (they all had big registries with at least 89 items experienced moms were smart enough to realize it was a waste of money) Also the thing about them yellowing and drying out is true. 
__label__neg	and even putting them in 1/3 doesn't help. 
__label__neg	Adding a 1/2 cup water to it does, but then were back to ITS NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!! 
__label__neu	Just hold them in your hands for a minute and there you go instant heat up. 
__label__neu	Also if you have a summer baby the wipes will heat on their own with this summer we have been having. 
__label__neu	And most wipes when you open them up anymore aren't that cold at all.
__label__pos	The kneeling stool is great. 
__label__pos	 The padding is sufficient and I love that it flips over to convert to a stool... 
__label__pos	Very useful! 
__label__neg	 BUT...the elbow pad is a joke! 
__label__neg	 There is a hard plastic honey comb underneath it and hard plastic surrounding it that force you to put your elbows into two tiny areas or risk severe pain from the plastic. 
__label__neg	 Not to mention that to two measley suction cups that are suppose to hold it onto the side of the tub do not work at all. 
__label__neg	 It constantly pops off the tub whenever I put any weight on it. 
__label__pos	 I don't regret my purchase because of the stool which works really great. 
__label__neu	I suggest that if you still want this product after reading the reviews, you try to find it used so that you don't have to pay retail.
__label__pos	I bought this for my daughter because it is spill proof, looks nice and has a soft silicon spout. 
__label__pos	It has a hard cover which protects the silicon spout, which is great because the little one loves to drop her cup. 
__label__neg	The problem is, it leaks! 
__label__neg	There are these 3 indents on the silicon part that should align with the three indents on the plastic cover, but for whatever reason, when I screw the top shut the alignment is always off. 
__label__neu	100% of the time! 
__label__neg	I have tried little tricks to make sure it remains aligned after I screw it shut, but the alignment always shifts and then the cup leaks. 
__label__neg	I never got to use the cup and have simply put it in the category of things that didn't work for me.
__label__neu	I purchased this for my 8 week old son who is 10 pounds and growing longer everyday. 
__label__pos	 I saw the good reviews and was so excited to get it. 
__label__neu	 Well... 
__label__pos	Pros:  Soft, warm, and cute. 
__label__neg	Cons:  A little too big, (he can break free EASILY), I've found my son with it over his mouth and nose numerous times, not good!! 
__label__neg	 The baby is able to wiggle down despite it being velcro and TIGHT. 
__label__neg	I would just use a large flannel blanket or something else, this isn't worth the money. 
__label__pos	UPDATE:  Unfortunately, I cannot change the star review or I'd bump it up to 4 stars +. 
__label__pos	 I gave this product more time and sure enough, my baby is addicted. 
__label__pos	 I don't know truly if it has to do with the swaddler but he is swaddled and sleeping soundly each night. 
__label__pos	 What a dream come true. 
__label__pos	 He likes to free his hands at night but the blanket keeps him covered and warm and it kind of hugs him.
__label__pos	We have the Precious Planet Jumperoo for our 5 month old daughter downstairs and she is seriously addicted to it.
__label__neu	We just purchased this farmyard for our 3rd floor use so we did not have to lug PPJ up all those stairs.
__label__neg	The reason I say I have to be fair is it is very likely that she seems bored with this one because the jumperoo is totally pimped out.
__label__pos	It plays music, better toys, better views and most importantly- the seat fits so much better.
__label__neg	I saw one reviewer's pic with the grandson in this thing with a rolled up towel in between him and the edges- it is WAY big there
__label__pos	But all in all, once a baby gets to jump in something, there is no going backward to stationary.
__label__neu	Your story may be different.
__label__neg	Washed it once according to directions & it shrunk beyond belief!
__label__neg	Didn't even use it once!
__label__neg	Don't bother!!!
__label__neg	Just use a pillowcase & it works just as well...
__label__neu	I bought this cover because it was the only brand offered at Babies R Us.
__label__neg	It was nearly worthless after the first washing because of how much it shrank.
__label__pos	I have since bought a Carter's cover and am much happier.
__label__neg	This thing is nothing to get excited about.
__label__neg	It's bulkier than it needs to be, and the slider fell off of mine and got lost immediately.
__label__pos	You can buy one almost just like it from Huggies full of wipes for about $3.
__label__neg	This pump advertises that it's design stimulates let-down, and that is not the case.
__label__neg	This pump will pull and tug at your nipple just as much as the next one, and because it's clear, you can see how much of your PRECIOUS breastmilk has been lost and stuck in the mechanical aspects of the pump.
__label__neg	You'd have more volume and less pain if you hand-express.
__label__neg	Our son was not a large baby, but he grew out of this tub within 3 months.
__label__neg	He also hated the sling that came with it.
__label__neg	The main problem we found was that our little guy was able to catapult himself upwards so easily when he would kick against the part of the tub that holds the washcloth/soap/etc.
__label__neg	This was not safe.
__label__neg	On top of that, he never seemed comfy.
__label__pos	We ended up buying the Primo Eurobath and it's perfect!
__label__pos	Bulky but a great tub.
__label__neg	I wish I'd registered for that one in the first place.
__label__neg	This Sure Comfort one was a waste of money, in my opinion.
__label__neg	This Taggies toy is not much fun for baby at all!
__label__neg	It's too difficult for even a year old baby too pull out the pink vibrating piece and when you pull it out for baby the cord is so short it literally moves for 3 seconds max!
__label__neg	Lastly it does not hold it's shape and flattens out over time even with barely any play time on it.
__label__neg	For the price there are MUCH better toys out there!
__label__neg	As much as we love the Ergo Baby, this insert thing just confused us.
__label__neg	It doesn't really fit very well and is hard to get in place.
__label__neg	It's very floppy / flimsy and really doesn't provide any support for the babies head (which is why we thought it would be good to have)Plus you only use it for about a month or two.
__label__neg	We ended up using a lightweight fleece blanket about 2-1/2 foot square.
__label__neg	I don't think you need this.
__label__neg	My child hates this toy.
__label__pos	He likes Freddie the firefly much better.
__label__neg	This toy does not make the crinkle noise.
__label__neg	The foot is suppose to honk and stopped honking after one month of light play as child was only 3 months old.
__label__neg	My child at one point was afraid of this animal.
__label__neg	It does have bright colors but is not fun for him at all.
__label__pos	I highly recommend freddie the firefly by lamaze instead.
__label__neg	I do not like these bags.
__label__neg	The twist tie closure system is cumbersome.
__label__neg	The bags are small.
__label__neg	The plastic is thin and leaks in the freezer when frozen.
__label__pos	The only advantage I can see to these bags is that they are easy to hook to the medella breast pump and pump into directly.
__label__neg	I bought this tub because it received really good reviews - but it is gigantic and really takes up half of my bathroom.
__label__neg	Also, because of it's size you don't transport it and end up keeping it in the bathtub anyway!I found it's just easier for my daughter to take a bath with me!
__label__neu	I looked everywhere for a tub without all the grooves for baby's body - I wanted something that would submerge nicely from the neck down and this looked like it would do the trick.
__label__neg	Unfortunately, it doesn't hold any water to submerge anything than perhaps the feet.
__label__neg	Leaks horribly, bulky - we gave up, returned it, and now we just bath with baby.
__label__neg	Nothing works better than you own hands on your slippery baby anyway, and you can avoid sore knees from bathroom tile and stiff back from bending over the tub.
__label__neg	It's crazy that I can't find a sippy straw cup that holds liquid without leaking and is not impossible to draw liquid out of!
__label__pos	This one doesn't leak unless my daughter drops it and it stays there for some time, and even then it just leaks a little bit.
__label__neg	But, it is SO hard to get the liquid out of through the straw.
__label__neg	I can hardly do it without busting an eardrum.
__label__neg	I have to take it from her between sips and squeeze the straw to get air back in the cup so she can sip again.
__label__neg	Yeah, she loves it when I take the bottle from her before she's done.
__label__neg	Same goes for the ones with the flippy lid thing.
__label__neg	My post baby weight was over 200lbs, if you are over 200 lbs, this is not for you.
__label__neg	I was only a few pounds over that so I thought
__label__neg	Err!
__label__neg	Wrong answer, I cracked the kneeler portion.
__label__neg	What a blow to the postpartum ego.
__label__neu	This was one of the first things I purchased because I had read everyone's reviews and everyone seemed to love it and called it a
__label__neg	WOW, what a waste of money!
__label__neg	If purchasing this item make sure you can place it somewhere where there is an outlet, be able to place it on some sort of protector to protect your changing table from water damage, and also be prepared to also buy the travel wipes warmer because your little one will get use to their bottom only being wiped with warm wipes which is not always so convenient if your out and about or traveling.
__label__neg	I didn't know why my Mother laughed at me when I told her I purchased this and now I know why.
__label__neg	Save your money and purchase something your baby really needs.
__label__neu	I bought this at babies r us.
__label__neg	It did not fit my rail.
__label__neg	It says it fits most standard rails but doesn't give any measurements.
__label__neg	How are you supposed to know if it will fit unless you purchase it?
__label__neg	What a pain.
__label__neu	I started out trying to give my newborn daughter this pacifier.
__label__neg	She sucked it a few times and then rejected it.
__label__neu	I was hopeful she would take it b/c I heard such good things about it and how it is supposed to be the best pacifier for breast-fed babies to avoid nipple confusion.
__label__neg	In the end, my daughter took the Gerber NUK for about a month and then refused all pacifiers all together.
__label__pos	Just as well since they say to wean them off around 4-6 months anyway.
__label__pos	These pads are very thin and do not show through your clothes.
__label__pos	I never leaked much, so these pads worked fine in that respect.
__label__neg	However, they do not hold up when you open your nursing bra for frequent breastfeeding.
__label__neg	The adhesive on the lining does not stay stuck to the bra and the absorbent filling comes loose and bunches up.
__label__neg	If you have these, they will work, but I much prefer the Lansinoh pads.
__label__neu	I ordered this product thinking it would be great if I could pump directly into the bottles we'd be feeding our baby with, eliminates a step right?
__label__neg	Well, having the extra bottles for pumping has been great and the work well in the freezer but they don't work well for feeding.
__label__neg	Milk seems to pour out our newborns mouth (3 mos now).
__label__neg	I hate pumping and really hate seeing my milk being wastes so we have stopped using the bottles to feed and only for storage.
__label__pos	I like the evenflow glass bottles better, she wastes very little milk with those
__label__neg	Like:  1) Removable handles, 2) BPA FreeDislike: 1) Ridiculously expensive, 2) Fidgety extra parts that do nothing except require cleaning and slow you down when you try to fill it.
__label__neg	3) LEAKS!
__label__neg	- No valve except the hole in the cup spout.
__label__neg	4) No valve except in the cup spout.
__label__neg	Our daughter chewed on one and the hole got a LOT bigger and leaks like crazy now - you can buy replacements for $7 for a pair.
__label__neu	My wife bought a bunch of these and matching bottles in the big BPA scare last year.
__label__neg	Now there are MANY better and much cheaper options.
__label__neg	I recommend anyone investigate those first.
__label__neg	This may sound pathetic, but after buying this product I find myself too lazy to use it.
__label__neg	You have to take time to stretch the elastic edges around the seat.
__label__neg	It's quicker to just throw a blanket over the seat.
__label__neg	I've actually decided to spend a few hundred bucks and just get the windows tinted.
__label__neg	It's so hot where I live that we're all sweating by the time the AC cools off the car.
__label__pos	I love the fact that my son takes well to these bottles.
__label__neg	Unfortunately, they are such a nightmare to wash and assemble.
__label__neg	I don't have a dishwasher, so I have to hand wash each piece.
__label__neg	I feel like my life revolves around washing, drying and assembling bottles.
__label__neg	My son is gassy.
__label__pos	He burps often with them, but he feeds well.
__label__neg	Beware of the nipple not tightening properly when you screw it on.
__label__neg	Many times I have been sprayed by an improperly fitting nipple.
__label__neg	Also, it's near impossible to warm this bottle up if you have cold formula.
__label__neg	If you place it in water the bottom collects it, only to pour out when it is inverted.
__label__neu	I give them 3 stars for my son...
__label__neg	I give them 1 star for myself!
__label__neg	The velcro that attaches to the mattress does keep the sheets snug, but getting the sheet off requires some force and can pull too [...] the seams of the bed.
__label__neg	I don't trust that no damage is going to occur.
__label__pos	I bought the expensive organic sheet from Arm's Reach for the mini co-sleeper, and I like it because the velcro does not attach.
__label__pos	Maybe that's a flaw, but it is so much easier to get on and off (and avoid damaging the bed), and it's plenty snug.
__label__pos	Plus, no pesticides used with it.
__label__neg	I am sorry I bought this tub.
__label__neg	It is very uncomfortable for my daughter.
__label__neu	Used it since she was about 3 weeks old.
__label__neg	I have to place a towel behind her head b/c the hard plastic is at such a sharp angle it's uncomfortable.
__label__neg	Also, there is a part where she got her foot stuck and she screamed with pain!
__label__neg	It's way too small.
__label__neg	She's now 4.5 mos and I'm throwing it away b/c she is practically flipping out of it.
__label__neg	And the plug is waaaaay too hard to plug -  it's an enormous effort to plug it each time.
__label__pos	I've switched to the First Years infant to toddler tub and it is way bigger, nicer, more comfortable, and it has no areas to pinch fingers or toes.
__label__neu	We received this graco digital monitor set for a baby shower gift.
__label__pos	When it works, it is very clear.
__label__neg	Most of the time it's annoying.
__label__neg	We've suffered through it losing connection and beeping extremely loudly.
__label__neg	It would be fine if we were pushing the limits of the range, but one room over it loses connection and reconnects twice an hour without being moved or touched.
__label__neg	In addition to the annoying beeping from disconnects, there are static pops, most likely from power line interfereance.
__label__neg	If you want true clarity with this device you may have to keep it on battery or use a power filter in front of each plug.
__label__neg	Such a waste of money - we ended up turning it off and leaving all of the doors open to listen for the baby.
__label__neg	Our child sleeps through the night without event but the bleeping baby monitor wakes us up every other hour with incessant crackling and beeping.
__label__neg	We're awake while our baby is peacefully sleeping.
__label__neg	We decided to buy the Philips SCD590 DECT based monitor that costs twice as much to replace this.
__label__pos	It was money well spent.
__label__neg	We'll give up eating out for two months to get non-interrupted sleep.
__label__pos	Our child sleeps like a baby..
__label__neu	we want to as well.
__label__neg	Don't buy this product -- it's not worth the frustration and annoyance.
__label__neg	My advice is to wait a few days before purchasing this item, to see if you really need it.
__label__neg	The quality of the product is just fine, but the functionality is pointless.
__label__neg	I thought (prior to having my baby) that I would need reminding of how long it had been since he was changed, fed, put down for a nap, etc...which turned out to be completely not true.
__label__neg	I never wonder if enough time had passed since feeding or changing or napping--it doesn't matter how much time has passed when your baby lets you know he is wet or hungry or sleepy!
__label__neg	Like many extraneous baby items that I purchased because I was so excited about my impending arrival, this item got zero usage.
__label__neg	These bottles leak so bad it is like they don't even have a top on.
__label__neg	And the ones Avent offers to replace them with if you call to complain also leak.
__label__neg	Don't buy this brand.
__label__neg	I can't fit much in this bag without the magnetic closures popping open.
__label__neg	The stitching on the liner on the inside that seperates compartments came undone after less than a year and is flimsy.
__label__neg	I've got two in diapers now and there is no way I can continue with this one any more.
__label__neg	Three diapers, a half empty bag of Kirkland wipes, one change of clothes, and an insulator pack for breast milk, prooved to be too much for the main compartment.
__label__neu	Pockets for the bottle and a water bottle on the sides are the only perks I can put on here, but most diaper bags have that, sooooo...
__label__neg	I think I've said enough.
__label__neu	With each baby, I bought this product by Munchkin.
__label__neg	The first time I threw it away after 2 uses, realizing that after all my efforts some food had stayed around the ring.
__label__neu	The second time...
__label__neu	I forgot which product I'd purchased.
__label__neg	I threw it away after one use.
__label__pos	A couple of weeks ago I bought the
__label__pos	Ok, it too requires some special effort to clean but it breaks down in a way the munchkin doesnt allowing better access to the ring for cleaning AND allowing replacement 'mesh'  Buy the 'starter pack' with 2 rings and 2 extra mesh.
__label__pos	Love, Love it.
__label__pos	The whole family can sit at the table to eat and when I need my hands for myself, my son has the Baby Safe Feeder and jsut about any juicy food I want to put in it.
__label__neu	I got this as a shower gift.
__label__neu	I really wanted it and was excited to use it.
__label__neg	My son is now 7 months old and it has never worked for us.
__label__neg	I use it in the tub, and here are my complaints:  First off, I could have just bought a mop bucket, my son always leans forward to chew on toys and gets a face full of water - I have to watch him like a hawk, hands ready to grab him at any moment, the white cushion seat constantly pops up from the bottom, and how am I supposed to clean the baby?
__label__neg	I can't get to all his parts.
__label__neg	He has to stand up and then I struggle to get him to sit down again.
__label__neg	I have been trying to like this thing for 7 months, but I have given up.
__label__neg	boo.
__label__neg	If you have a child who is active or a wiggler, don't bother with these cups.
__label__neg	My 11 month-old easily scatters the contents of this cup everywhere when she waves her arms or bangs the cup on the table.
__label__neg	Munchkin's version is much better.
__label__neu	I have not used any other diaper pails so I am no expert on this.
__label__neg	I am used to the operation of Diaper Genie  and do not find it that difficult to use
__label__pos	Before Katie was born I bought a plug in wall freshener unit in a pretty rose smell and her room always smelled so nice.
__label__neg	Now it smells like a diaper and she only makes #2 every other day and I empty the Genie at least one a week.
__label__neu	I am thinking of trying the level 2 refills before I buy a whole different unit though so maybe that will help.
__label__neu	Wiping the Genie out with disinfecting wipes and spraying with Lysol helps a little.
__label__neg	I can change a poopie diaper like a pro but everytime I empty out the
__label__pos	This product looked so beautiful online.
__label__neg	What a waste of money it was.- It was very annoying to put together and it doesn't fit through doorways, so it needs to be assembled and disassembled in the room where it is used- It was cheap materials - the
__label__pos	I loved the fleece version of this and bought the cotton one for summer.
__label__neg	Big mistake.
__label__neg	Don't waste your money.
__label__neg	The cotton is not pre-shrunk, so when you wash it the first time and it shrinks, the zipper ends up being too long, which causes the fabric to gather/bunch up.
__label__neg	Very disappointed.
__label__neu	1.
__label__neg	It was not the same as the photo, but I was too lazy to contact Amazon about it.2.
__label__neg	Baby only likes it slightly.
__label__neu	We have had this bottle rack for about a year now and initially we thought it was a good investment.
__label__neg	That was until the top rack kept falling down and this is WITHOUT glass bottles.
__label__neg	When the top rack falls you pick it up to reposition it and the small plastic things at the top fall everywhere, so you have to remove those before repositioning the rack.
__label__neg	It has just become more annoying than useful.
__label__neg	Folks, I am NOT kidding!
__label__neg	A local TV channel 3 affiliate here in Ohio ran a story the other day about a couple that had one of these that greatly malfunctioned.
__label__neg	The new mom interviewed said that the product started emitting a burning smell, and when she looked down at it, she couldn't believe her eyes...
__label__neg	the plastic around where the power cord plugs in was completely melted!
__label__neg	Then to add insult to injury, they claimed that Evenflo would take a while to send them back their refund.
__label__neu	Perhaps this was a 'fluke', but I felt obligated to tell all of you about this.
__label__neu	My wife is expecting our first child in August, and we will be looking at breast pumps as well.
__label__neg	But not Evenflo.
__label__neu	I bought this room thermometer despite all the bad reviews b/c I figured you can't believe everything you hear or read.
__label__neg	In this case...you can!
__label__neg	It only reads ONE temperature which is 77 degrees!!
__label__neg	Doesn't move from that.
__label__neg	I get frustrated and put it away and pull it out again like a month later and try again, but get the same reading, 77 degrees when I know it's a good 50 degrees outside & our air unit was off.
__label__neg	I don't think it works right.
__label__neg	Oh, well :(
__label__neg	I love the tub and sling but I find the shower attachment to be a huge waste of time.
__label__neg	The water doesn't come out in too good of a stream and the container takes up too much room in the tub.
__label__neg	The button that you have to press for the shower should be on the side, it would be easier to use.
__label__neg	I have found that a little plastic cup works much better to rinse baby off with.
__label__neg	That being said I wish I had just paid a little less and got the model without the shower.
__label__neu	I bought this because of the high user ratings / comments & a recommendation from my Doula.
__label__pos	I also love the idea of wrapping him on because it seems more organic and natural.
__label__neu	THE GOOD*Might be decent to use once the weather turns really cool (winter time).
__label__neg	THE BAD*Too bulky:: Even with directions, I found the Moby tedious to handle and tie due to its bulk and length.*Thick material:: The material wasn't very breathable due to the thick cotton.
__label__neu	In the S.
__label__neg	California climate I live in, it can get pretty warm during the day and this just creates way too much heat.
__label__neg	OVERALL*If I lived in a mostly cool/cold climate this might work for me but I don't.
__label__pos	I put the Moby in storage and currently using (and very satisfied with) a Baby Bjorn carrier.
__label__neg	We registered for this and believed that it would be an absolute necessity, but I wish we hadn't, at least right away.
__label__neg	Because if you breastfeed your baby, the diapers really DON'T stink that much!
__label__neg	It's not worth the extra money for the expensive refills, so we've just been plopping diapers in the regular trash can which goes out a few times a week.
__label__pos	I have noticed no particular odor since we started doing this.
__label__neu	However, once she starts solids, I'm going to get the diaper genie back out and use it again.
__label__neg	My other complaint is that the cutting mechanism doesn't work properly.
__label__neg	Every time we've tried to empty it, we ended up getting out a pair of scissors.
__label__pos	These were so cute when I got them in the mail.
__label__neg	In the first wash, the seams started to fray a bit and the color faded right away.
__label__neg	Also the vecro is a bit scratchy, you have to be careful when putting it on that none of it is touching babys neck or it will scratch her.
__label__neg	I wouldn't buy them again.
__label__neg	I have tried to use this carrier a dozen times, but to no avail.
__label__neg	My good-natured son cries and cries in what seems to be discomfort.
__label__neg	Though he's only 11 lbs, my shoulders ache after having him in it for only minutes--I guess the straps are not padded enough.
__label__neg	I thought I would be saving money by purchasing a Snugli instead of a Baby Bjorn!
__label__neg	I gave it two stars because it was easy to set up and it positions nicely--just didn't work out for us.
__label__neu	I recommend trying it out at the store before purchasing.
__label__neg	My daughter really likes the cold of the frozen teether rings, but just can't seem to hold on to it long enough because it's too cold for her hands.
__label__neg	I thought this would be great.
__label__neg	After staying in the freezer overnight, this teether stays cold for about 15 seconds.
__label__neg	Plus, the green
__label__neg	It's not her cheeks that need soothing!
__label__neg	This seat is not at all sturdy.
__label__neg	The bottom portion will not stay down, and I'm not about to put my baby into it.
__label__neg	I bought it yesterday, and I'm returning it tomorrow.
__label__neg	It does not seem safe at all.
__label__neg	It is so light that it seems like the baby could easily tip over.
__label__pos	To start with I loved these cups - my daughter went from bottle to these without missing a beat.
__label__neu	But then she realized it was fun to stick her fingers in the spout and air hole as well as biting them.
__label__neg	She destructed one every 2 weeks.
__label__neg	This would have been OK if you could buy replacement spouts as Its most likely a phase but I can't find them ANYWHERE so I had to buy entire replacement bottles.
__label__neg	I now have six bottles but just the one spout.
__label__pos	I've now decided to try the Nuby ones as they seem more sturdy for the spout overall and you can buy replacement spouts - a lot less cost and waste.
__label__pos	I bought this for my 6 week old daughter because the price was nice and the table was attractive.
__label__neg	I tried to put it together and I could not figure it out!
__label__neg	It does not seem very sturdy at all and I would be worried putting her on it.
__label__neg	I am returning it back to the store.
__label__pos	My sister has the same table and her's is fine.
__label__neu	Maybe I just picked up a bad one.
__label__pos	We used this hamper for nearly nine months for my daughter and it has been great.
__label__pos	The mesh bag does make it very easy to move the dirty laundry to the washer.
__label__neu	After about nine months we decided it was time to toss the denim portion into the wash.
__label__pos	Following the instructions I was excited to have a revitalized hamper.
__label__neg	Sadly, when I tried to fit it back onto the frame it had shrunk considerably.
__label__neg	I will probably be able to rig it by sewing on some added Velcro, but would strongly recommend that you hand-wash and line dry, don't even let the dryer look at the wet item!
__label__neg	:) Since I was really impressed with the idea of a washable hamper at the time of purchase we will not be buying one for Baby #2 when the time comes.
__label__neg	Tried to use it several times but my daughter hated it.
__label__neg	I could tell that she was not very comfortable.
__label__neg	It did not allow her to move her arms where she wanted to.
__label__neg	Also it is very small in size.
__label__neg	If she did like it,  it would not have lasted very long.
__label__neg	very hard to assemble after cleaning, unless you want to clean it assembled which is not a good idea.
__label__pos	I ordered this because it contains the colors babies are first able to see.
__label__neg	I was disappointed with the quality.
__label__neg	The pictures look like a five year old drew them and are somewhat scary.
__label__neg	Great concept, poor quality.
__label__neg	My husband and I read all of the poor reviews on this product, and we really should have listened to them!
__label__pos	However, we were drawn to the bouncenette's pretty neutral color and seeming usefulness.
__label__neg	We were wrong--it wasn't useful.
__label__neg	Here's a list of all that we found wrong with this bouncenette:*When our baby was a newborn, she wasn't properly supported by the seat, and would end up in very weird positions (head near the bottom of the seat, slumped over to the side, etc...) while sleeping.
__label__neg	We thought of placing towels or blankets on either end, but that didn't seem safe.*The vibration is weak.*The toys are very boring and out of the baby's reach, which is pointless.*It's awkward to carry around.*After only two months, we coudn't find any use for this product.
__label__pos	We went back to the store and bought the Ocean Wonders bouncer, which is cheaper and a much better product.
__label__neg	Listen to the reviews--don't waste your money.
__label__neg	I bought this, put it on the crib, took one look at it, took it off, and returned it.
__label__neg	I have a standard 28x52 crib and this was too big for it--it bunched and wouldn't lay flat.
__label__neg	Also the snaps didn't match up well w/ my cribs slats and even if they did they were too long to actually be safe and secure.
__label__neg	This mattress pad/sheet creates an unsafe environment.
__label__neg	My daughter slept w/ us or a bassinet until she was 3 months old and by then the diaper leaks and constant spit up were behind us so I don't have to change her ordinary crib sheet that often anyway.
__label__neg	These bottles are extremely frustrating.
__label__neg	Sometimes they leak, other times they don't.
__label__neg	And after trying all the suggestions to prevent and stop leaking to no avail, I'm giving up.
__label__neg	Do not buy!
__label__pos	I have used Born-Free bottles while working as a nanny and never once had to deal with a leak.
__label__pos	I reccomend those instead.
__label__neg	My son is 18 1/2 pounds and it's too small for him.
__label__neg	The formation of the seat is very squished and I don't know why.
__label__neg	There's no room to move or stretch or anything!
__label__neg	Once the baby is in there he/she is stuck until someone takes him out.
__label__neg	Kind of like a taco!
__label__neg	The mobile toys are too low as my baby is always trying to reach up to them where as w/ another swing I have he just looks and enjoys.
__label__neg	It's very difficult to adjust the seat positioning and my mom (who has this swing) has to turn the entire swing upside down to do it.
__label__pos	Luckily we got this for $30 at a thrift store in brand new condition so even though it won't last much longer for my boy it won't be a total loss like it would if we had paid full price.
__label__neg	We have an elongated toilet and I don't know of anyway to hold this seat in place.
__label__neg	My daughter has trouble sitting back far enough because when she tries to scoot back, the whole seat goes with her.
__label__neg	So when she pees, it gets in between the potty ring and the toilet seat and makes a big mess.
__label__neg	My 15 month old daughter has absolutely no interest in this toy.
__label__neg	We bought this for her when she was around 6 months old or so and she has never played with it.
__label__neg	It doesn't do anything.
__label__neg	I think there is one spot that will play a little bit of music when you squeeze it, but that's about it.
__label__neg	Save your money.
__label__neg	We got 2 of these and had the same problem with both.
__label__neg	The cloth on this cover already had some snags on it when we took it out of the package.
__label__neg	After washing it as directed, it has gotten even worse.
__label__neg	It has strings hanging all over it.
__label__neg	It's a very useful item, but the quality of the fabric is terrible!
__label__pos	A friend of mine had the same problem, and she recommends the Especially for Baby brand (less expensive and better quality).
__label__pos	When I first started using this product I loved it!
__label__pos	It was so nice to be able to pump directly into the liner, rather than pump into a bag that then needs to be transferred to the liner (what a mess!).
__label__neg	However, there were several cons to them:1) the sealing disks start to leak after several uses2) if you want to build up any sort of supply in the freezer, plan on spending a LOT of money because you cannot just buy extra pieces - you must buy a whole new kit, and each kit only provides storage for 4 bottles!3) if you have a double breast pump, you have to buy 2 kits in the first place cause it only has 1 pump adaptor!I like the playtex premium nurser, and wish the storage kit was more economical (and even if not economical, I'd like it if they didn't leak)I recommend you save some money and buy the Gerber storage bottles, which come in a package of 4 and are very inexpensive.
__label__neu	I haven't seen them online, but you can buy them in BRU.
__label__neg	These are more expensive than buying the Medela or other brand storage bags - but those bags are such a pain IMO.
__label__pos	The bottles are great because you can easily pour them into the liners.
__label__neg	This was not usable at all for me with my newborn.
__label__neg	It is complicated to put on and adjust, and my tiny baby was completely enveloped by it, and I did not feel she was very secure in it.
__label__neg	I'm sure this would be great for an older child, for travel, or being out and about, but for trying to hold a small baby while doing chores around the house (or anything else, for that matter), this one's a no-go.
__label__neu	I bought this product based on the reviews I read about a year ago.
__label__neg	My daughter is now 11 months old and the entire room STINKS whenever we have to dispose of a soiled diaper!
__label__neg	I have to change the bag every time she has a BM.
__label__neg	I finally gave up and and bought another Diaper Genie.
__label__pos	I had one with my first two children and it may be more of a hassle to use but I do not recall it omitting as much odor as the Diaper Dekor Plus.
__label__neg	Save your money, don't buy this product!
__label__neg	The wipes dry out quickly or are too soggy, there was no in between.
__label__neg	Furthermore, this thing is really a gimmick
__label__neg	YOur baby won't die of hypothermia if you don't have a wipe warmer.
__label__neu	If the thing is that cold, hold it in your hand for a few minutes.
__label__neg	Sold mine on ebay.
__label__neg	Don't waste your time or money.
__label__neg	Put the twenty bucks in your kid's college fund instead.
__label__neu	It's a much better investment
__label__neg	These monitors were priced reasonably, but I would have rather paid more if that meant better quality.
__label__neg	My husband and I have to sleep with the monitor in our bed because it seems to be much less static if a person is close to it.
__label__neu	If we touch it, the static seems to decrease.
__label__neg	I do like the two monitors and that it can clip on your hip if you are moving around, but I find the static extremely annoying and disturbing.
__label__neu	Many other reviewers say that it may be their area.
__label__neg	Where is a monitor that will work in anyone's area??
__label__neg	These pads are definitely due for some revamping.
__label__neg	When women can buy nearly customized bras based on chest width and cup size, it's ridiculous to have a
__label__neu	I have read other reviews and women complain about washable/reusable pads, but after trying everything out there, I would argue that washable pads:*fit better*look better from the outside (these look like you're stuffing with Kleenex)*are a lot easier to put back in one-handed while holding a baby - no messing around with annoying adhesives and strange folds in the materialDisposable do tend to be better for women who leak a lot, but before settling on these pads, try both.
__label__pos	I bought every kind out there, both reusable and disposable, and found some I swear by from Mimi Maternity.
__label__pos	They fit well, aren't noticable, and won't leak.
__label__neg	My (very strong and big for her age) 10-month-old wants to make music so badly with her octopus but the legs don't toot so easily--it takes a strong (adult) hand to make music.
__label__neu	Does anyone else have that problem or do we just have a dud?
__label__neu	She's had this since birth and has just shown an interest in it in the past month or two.
__label__neg	It's a big toy for an infant, heavy and not easily dragged around.
__label__neg	I wish it responded to her squeezes.
__label__neg	Again, she's got a strong grip but gets frustrated with it pretty fast.
__label__neu	We have this same bath mat but in the elmo design.
__label__neg	It's not too great.
__label__neg	The mat itself is pretty slippery, not too much traction on it.
__label__neg	The worst thing is the horrible smell it gives off.
__label__neg	It smells like a skunk.
__label__neg	I know when it comes to certain plastic products, they have this certain chemical smell that goes away shortly after you remove it from the packaging.
__label__neg	This is NOTHING like that.
__label__neg	It smells so bad and it's so strong.
__label__neg	My whole bathroom smells like there is a skunk living in it.*UPDATE: My daughter slipped on this mat.
__label__neg	There is no traction on this mat.
__label__neg	The little Elmos are the only pieces that are made of no-slip rubber.
__label__neg	As you can see in the photos, the Elmos are pretty far apart, especially for baby feet.
__label__neg	Not a good mat at all.
__label__neg	This step-up is a danger.
__label__neg	It does not secure to the toilet, so if the child pulls on the handrail before placing *significant* body weight on the step, he may fall or it could be pulled off-center and slip off the toilet.
__label__neg	The legs are too short for our toilet, and our toilet is not one of those fancy extra high toilets.
__label__neg	There is no really reliable way to prop the legs that wouldn't possibly be slippery or unstable.
__label__neg	The handrails are too short & small to be truly useful.
__label__neg	Lastly, I tried to secure this step-up to our toilet and the cushie toilet seat would then be too far back from the front of the toilet.
__label__neg	We thought about keeping this one
__label__neg	It's going back.
__label__neu	I requested this item on my baby registry.
__label__pos	It is beautiful and is very easy to assemble.
__label__neg	The main problem I have is the speed, which is almost as important as the construction of the swing.
__label__neg	There seems to be no middle groud between not moving and light speed.
__label__neu	The instructions actual say that if you have a ligher childer, which I did, that you should put a towel behind the swing to create some drag and slow it down.
__label__neu	I did try beacuse I wanted to make sure I exhausted all methods of using the swing.
__label__neg	The tray does not come off easliy and my daughterr never enjoyed this lovely swing.
__label__neg	I was really excited to use this item since my son was born in December but it was so diffuclt to figure out how it fits on to the car seat I just gave up and returned it.
__label__pos	I got this pale b/c it was cheap.
__label__neg	Yes you can use any bag for it but it doesn't hide the smell and the lid slams down on its own almost catching my fingers while I'm changing the bag.
__label__neg	So unless you like a smelly house and have 3 arms to change a bag dont buy!!
__label__neu	I chose these bottles admittedly because it's a well known brand.
__label__neg	However upon using these bottles I became increasingly frustrated with leaking issues.
__label__neg	The caps leak frequently and waste the formula that should be ingested by my baby.
__label__neg	It also appeared to create gas which made her miserable.
__label__neg	I would never buy Advent again.
__label__neu	I bought a few Avent bottles when I was at a grocery store and had to have a bottle RIGHT then and this was all they had.
__label__neg	I was not disappointed in the quality of the bottle, but I was not overly impressed.
__label__neu	I did not notice a change in my son's spitting up using these bottles, either.
__label__neg	The downside of using the Avent system is that, once you commit, you're really committed - the bottles and bottle parts do not fit standard bottles and parts.
__label__neg	I now have a wide variety of bottles and bottle parts, and the Avent bottles sit largely unused because I cannot mix and match the parts.
__label__neg	Who has time to search for the right parts when their baby is hungry and crying?
__label__neg	I wish I had done more research before buying this item.
__label__neg	After talking to the hospital staff & reading parents' comments here, I do not plan to use it for my newborn.
__label__neg	SIDS experts do not approve of its use for the very reason many moms are talking about here...it is made of soft foam and can suffocate babies.
__label__neg	(especially given that the baby can slide down the incline and get there nose/mouth covered by the soft side cushions.
__label__neg	$20 wasted for me!
__label__pos	I got this as a gift and loved it for the first six months.
__label__neg	Then I discovered what a waste of money it was.
__label__neg	Once solid foods were introduced into my son's diet, this didn't even come close to holding in the stench.
__label__neu	I even used the different types of refills that were made for it...ie.
__label__neu	infant, original and toddler.
__label__neg	Still didn't do the trick.
__label__neu	I even put air fresheners in and near it....
__label__neg	Eventually I gave up and took dirty diapers straight out to the garage and only used it for pee diapers.
__label__neg	Still a hassle to remove the
__label__pos	Much less hassle and same results.
__label__pos	I purchased these for my daughter to use in the baby's room because they matched the bedding set and other items she'd chosen.
__label__neg	Overpriced is the least of the complaints I have about these.
__label__neg	The colors are muddy compared to the bedding and the vinyl smell is overpowering.
__label__neu	I opened the package and set them out to air for 3 weeks before giving them to the kids to put up in the baby's room.
__label__neg	They set them out on a countertop to straighten the folds out and the cheap vinyl odor was still so bad it dominated any room they were in.
__label__neg	Noxious as the smell is, I suspect it's probably giving off some kind of airborne pollutants that are not healthy for a newborn to be exposed to.
__label__neg	Needless to say, they haven't been used.
__label__neg	These burp clothes are extremely thin.
__label__neg	They are so gauzy that you can see through them, so they won't even work for a game of
__label__neg	These were not thick enough for me to use as a burp cloth, let alone the
__label__neg	These would not work in our house even as a dish cloth, let alone absorbing any type of baby mess!The only reason I didn't give only a single star is because Gerber was very nice about giving me a refund on these - they guarantee all their products.
__label__neg	I just don't think they described accurately what you are getting.
__label__neg	They are definitely not the diaper service quality, however, if you don't have 3 different levels of diapers to choose from at your local store, how would you even know that there were different grades of diapers when it says
__label__neg	They need to be more descriptive in their product packaging.
__label__pos	For burp cloths, I prefered the Kooshie baby brand which are very absorbant, very soft and durable as well.
__label__neg	I am extremely tired of having to clean up messes after feeding our twin sons with the Avent bottles.
__label__neg	Especially if we are out for a big event and the boys are dressed nicely.
__label__pos	The bottles worked great for the first six months and then.....
__label__neg	THEY ALL LEAKED.
__label__neg	It was not a small leak rather, a pouring leak that soaked their shirts.
__label__neg	I hate these bottles and plan to switch!!!
__label__neg	This was a waste of money.
__label__neg	I got it so that my daughters head would not fall forward while she was sleeping in her car seat but the part that goes behind her head is so bulky that it actually pushes her head forward.
__label__neg	It also limits their head movement when they are awake, so I had to take it off anyway.
__label__neg	It did not hug her head like it is shown in the picture.
__label__neu	I think you would be better off with one of those small boppy like pillows they make for this same purpose and just put it under their chin when they fall asleep.
__label__neg	I have C-cup and I found that the fit was terrible.
__label__neg	You could also see them under my clothes.
__label__neg	But worst of all - it actually dried onto my nipple and tore some skin off when I tried to remove them!!!
__label__neg	I threw the rest of the box away.
__label__pos	Then I tried Lansanoh pads, both super absorbant & ultra thin, and loved them both.
__label__pos	No problems with sticking.
__label__neg	I don't recommend the Medela nursing pads at all.
__label__neu	I bought this for my son's baby car seat because I would find him with his head bobbed to the side when I checked on him.
__label__neg	It looked very uncomfortable.
__label__neu	Hoping that this would solve the problem I bought this item.
__label__neg	I have to say that it is a waste of money.
__label__pos	There are no instructions in the package, thankfully it's easy to figure out.
__label__neg	I installed it both as a single and also as a double and neither variation supported my sons head properly.
__label__neg	I would still find him with his head bobbed to the side and looking uncomfortable.
__label__neg	If I had the packaging I would return it.
__label__neu	I will try it as he gets a bit older and see if it works better.
__label__pos	I ended up using a rolled up receiving blanket and that worked much better.
__label__neg	Save your money.
__label__neg	I would have given it zero stars but the lowest is one.
__label__pos	I brought my newborn daughter home from the hospital yesterday excited to use my new VentAire bottles instead of the little disposable similac bottles that they give you at the hospital.
__label__neg	BIG MISTAKE!
__label__neg	She struggled with the nipples hardly getting anything out of them.
__label__neu	I tried both the stage one and two.
__label__neu	I then tried the Evenflo Comfi that we received in out hospital bag.
__label__pos	She loves it and I love it because I don't have to watch my 5 day old baby struggle to eat!
__label__neg	I went to Babies R Us and returned the VentAires that my husband thankfully did not sterilize and bought the Evenflo Comfis.
__label__neg	The VentAire sounded great but I am very disappointed and caution everyone who decides to use them.
__label__neu	These are fine if you clean one bottle a day.
__label__neg	They just can't hold up to regular use.
__label__neg	The nipple brush is OK - but it goes pretty quick too.
__label__neg	The bottle brush just simply wouldn't get the bottles clean.
__label__neg	Spend the money on a munchkin bottle brush ....
__label__neg	My baby's head falls to the side in this swing!
__label__neg	It does NOT recline enough.
__label__neg	This is for babies who have full head support and can sit up on their own.
__label__neg	Not, NOT for newborns!!!
__label__neg	Needs to be re-called.
__label__neg	If you are going to use this swing, make sure you are within eye sight of your baby, don't take any chances and leave baby for any length of time because his/her head can get caught in the side, even with the net there.
__label__neu	I purchased the 'rest assured' sleep postioner for one of our twins girls & was given this 'inclined to sleep' from a friend, so decided to use that for our other twin girl.
__label__neg	I have to say I do not like the inclined to sleep at all.
__label__neg	When I place my daughter on it she manages to slip down the angled pillow, so when I go in to check on her she is scrunched up at the bottom of it.
__label__neg	Kind of acts like a slide.
__label__neg	Also if the baby spits up & you have to wash it, then it takes a long time to dry the foam insert.
__label__pos	Our other twin daughter has been using the 'rest assured' sleep positioner & I love it, so I just went out today & purchased a second one so they can both have a safe good nights sleep.
__label__neg	My baby has had some fun with this toy (3-5months) but it definately ranks far down the list of toys he enjoys and I'm sure there are hundreds of others I could have purchased instead of this one and gotten more playtime out of them.
__label__neg	The suction cup works but only if you have a place to suction it that your baby can't reach but can see and it doesn't frustrate him to not be able to touch his toys.
__label__neg	All the pieces come apart from each other which is nice but also a problem if you're trying to keep it together.
__label__neg	Most babies are stronger than velcro and magnetic clasps.
__label__neg	It's also just not as interesting to look at or chew as many other toys we've tried.
__label__neg	This product doesn't get the job done.
__label__neg	My son slid down it every night.
__label__neg	I finally gave up.
__label__neg	Also not matter how I placed the side things he always mannaged to roll onto his side.
__label__neg	Once he got older ( 2 months) if he wasn't sliding down it, he was pushing himself up it.
__label__neg	Then his head fell off of the top and got wedged in between this and the bumper!
__label__neg	That is when I stopped using it.
__label__neg	It's a great concept, just not practical.
__label__neu	My mattress is water proof plus I do not use it to change diapers.
__label__neg	I threw mine out.
__label__neg	You might as well glue a foam pool noodle to the crib rail, becuase this thing doesn't stick. 
__label__neu	Seeing that others have had problems with these not sticking, I figured that they couldn't be manufactured that poorly and that others were maybe not cleaning the rail well enough before applying. 
__label__neu	I was wrong. 
__label__neg	These don't stick without the help of your adhesive of choice.
__label__pos	We bought this monitor because so many reviews said they had no to little problems with static with this monitor. 
__label__neg	How far from the truth this is for us. 
__label__neu	We have 3 computers in our home connected to a wireless network. 
__label__neu	Each time information is sent from the modem to the PC's, the monitor picks up static. 
__label__neg	Some evenings the static is so bad, we just have to turn it off, and perk our ears, the good old-fashioned way. 
__label__neu	Also, it picks up on our cellphones as well as the house phone. 
__label__neg	This product definitely does not follow modern technology. 
__label__neg	I would shop around for another one if you have wireless equipment in the house.
__label__pos	I bought this bib after a lot of recommendations. 
__label__neg	I was very disappointed. 
__label__neg	First, the pocket is pretty much useless. 
__label__neg	It clings to the bib itself and doesn't catch half the food... 
__label__neg	even when it does, it's hard to get it out. 
__label__neg	It makes it very hard to clean these bibs sort of putting them in the laundry. 
__label__neg	Plus I used dish soap and let them dry out for a long time but one of the bib started to have black mold stains, and even cleaned that way they end up stinking after a day. 
__label__neg	Then, even with the little sleeves, my 16 month old managed to pull it off right away, so unless you can watch your kid like a hawk when he's eating, I'd look elsewhere.
__label__neg	First, polyester cover - scratchy and not very soft. 
__label__neu	Secondly, there is a weird contour of the pillow that pokes right at your stomach. 
__label__neu	 I don't know why they contoured it this way. 
__label__neu	 Is this supposed to support your breasts? 
__label__neu	 If so, it's in the wrong place. 
__label__neg	Lastly, too short! 
__label__neg	 I'm only 5'2 and I really have to bend my knees inorder for my legs to be supported by this.
__label__pos	For a bouncy seat, it does the job. 
__label__neu	However, as a first time Mom there are a few things I would have reconsidered. 
__label__neu	Our little one is a bit over 5 months old and has been using this since she was first born. 
__label__pos	First, the pros to this seat:1. 
__label__pos	It's colorful and sturdy.2. 
__label__neu	It's lightweight.3. 
__label__neu	It vibrates.4. 
__label__pos	It's affordable5. 
__label__neg	It's washableNext, the cons:1. 
__label__neu	For a newborn/infant - I felt that the head support was only so-so. 
__label__neu	I added a detachable head support for the first several weeks because our baby's head kept falling to the side.2. 
__label__neg	It's absolutely impossible to maneuver your baby into the seat WITH the mobile bar attached without hitting your child in the head/face with the hard molded plastic mobile toys.3. 
__label__neu	The seat doesn't play any music - which our baby really would have loved. 
__label__neg	The middle mobile toy (the lion) rotates between a really wussy purr and a VERY short song. 
__label__neg	It's a shame the song isn't longer.4. 
__label__neu	If you baby is at all active, she will just kick the hard bottom of the seat where the on/off switch is. 
__label__neu	Would I buy this seat again? 
__label__neg	I don't think so - I'd search for a better alternative that plays music.
__label__neg	This toy doesn't stay together well. 
__label__neg	After a couple of uses the base gets flimsy after folding it up and the bar flops either back or forward, causing the toys to be out of reach and out of vision. 
__label__neg	This toy ois designed for a child who is ready to track and grab, but the toys are out of reach. 
__label__neg	I had to buy longer toys to get my child interested in it enough to try to reach for the others, but he would freak out when the bar flopped out of useable reach. 
__label__neg	I replaced it with the fisher price aquarium wonders model. 
__label__neg	This one is WAY better for the extra $10. 
__label__neu	It has 2 bars, one for kicking, or just reverse the baby when he gets bored. 
__label__pos	Plus it has a great tummy time set up and way more durable.
__label__neu	I have both the Halo fleece sleep sack and this cotton one. 
__label__neg	The cotton one is very flimsy and doesn't compare in quality to the fleece one - if you want a cotton sleep sack - why not just put the baby in a nightgown? 
__label__pos	The fleece one, however, is aweseom (even though I like the LullaBag slightly better than the Halo fleece sleep sack)
__label__pos	This is my first review on Amazon, because I felt compelled to share my thoughts on this product. 
__label__neu	I am a first time mom and did a lot of research on car seats. 
__label__pos	This one seemed to get good marks . 
__label__pos	The positives: yes, its very cute, relatively light, installs fairly easily. 
__label__neu	However, as some reviewers pointed it does not adjust in the front, you have to mess with the metal buckles in the back. 
__label__neu	Does not seem like a big deal to you? 
__label__neg	Trust me, it will when you have a screaming child to deal with. 
__label__neg	VERY USER UNFRIENDLY! 
__label__neg	ON top of it, the fabric is awful , she sweats so bad in it, even with AC on high. 
__label__neu	Granted I have not tried other car seats, maybe they use similar fabric, because of flammability requirements. 
__label__neg	I just know this one needs to be redesigned. 
__label__pos	 But to each his own, I guess, a lot of people love it. 
__label__neu	For first time parents, I urge you to try it out at WAl Mart or Target first, before ordering it online, based on good reviews. 
__label__neg	I would not buy it again, thats for sure.
__label__neg	This product makes me crazy! 
__label__neg	 My 13 month old holds the top open and spills the contents everywhere. 
__label__neg	 Great concept, but there must be a better design.
__label__neg	Total waste of money!! 
__label__neg	 I recommend anything else that requires regular trash bags instead of expensive refills!! 
__label__neg	 We just use a regualr kitchen trash can now instead!
__label__neu	I noticed that some gave this pump high ratings but over all this pump gets just 3 stars. 
__label__neg	Maybe some have had better luck with this than others but I noticed that more people stated that it didn't work well. 
__label__neg	I bought this pump and right away I had problems when I would be pumping it would fall apart. 
__label__neg	It made my breasts hurt like they have never hurt before with any other pump Ive used in the past. 
__label__pos	You get what you pay for if you are going back to work you might want to invest in an electric Breast pump, I bought the Playtex Embrace double breast pump and it works wonderfully. 
__label__neg	PS When I called TFY about my problems the lady just told me how to put it back together (that wasn't the problem) and got off the phone quickly with me. 
__label__neg	This went into the trash where it belongs
__label__neu	I bought these because my daughter was a spitter. 
__label__neu	She would always get to much air and spit up half of what she ate. 
__label__neg	So I bought these to try and she hated them. 
__label__neg	I have also tried the Avent and she got to much ait with those too. 
__label__pos	The ones she likes and works best are the playtex nursers. 
__label__neu	You can puch the air out so you dont have to worry about it. 
__label__pos	plus she was easier to burb. 
__label__neg	I wouldnt recommend these or avent.
__label__neg	Mine didn't work from day 1! 
__label__pos	But we kept it anyway, my son still likes to play with it. 
__label__neg	it makes a cute bath toy, but nothing else.
__label__neg	Another MUST HAVE I was told. 
__label__neg	I think not. 
__label__pos	Pillows are much more effective in my opinion to prop up the baby while nursing. 
__label__neg	The boppy just wasn't comfortable for me, it was too stiff. 
__label__neg	I didn't feel like it really fit me - and I am not a big woman - size 8 before pregnancy, size 10-12 while nursing. 
__label__neg	I really think it is overrated and not necessary. 
__label__pos	I have heard good things about 'my breast friend' I might try that one next time. 
__label__pos	But still felt like the pillows did the trick.
__label__neu	I bought this hoping it would help me organise all my baby diapering needs. 
__label__neg	Unless you have a changing station (or crib, wherever you want to hang it) that has slits or slots able to hold it - the velcro will NOT hold it well. 
__label__neg	And the 'shelves' are a bit insecure. 
__label__neu	It's a great idea, but just didn't pan out.
__label__neu	That's right-- it's cute to look at for a little boy, which is why we put it on our registry. 
__label__neu	Well, our son has been using it since about 4.5 months. 
__label__neg	Not much fun as a stationary entertainer-- not enough for baby to do, and many of the toys are repetitive. 
__label__neu	So, we thought, maybe better once he gets mobile? 
__label__neg	No, not any better at all. 
__label__neg	Still kind of boring, rough plastic edges (scratch your child and your hardwood floors), and forget about rolling on carpet at all-- that requires monumental effort, even from an adult. 
__label__neg	The stationary 'jump' setting is also a joke; we own a FP Jumperoo and when we put my son in here to jump, I kid you not, he looked at us like 'you have got to be kidding me.' Given all these factors, I think there are much better walkers/activity centers on the market-- buy something else. 
__label__neg	For the price, this walker/entertainer is a very poor value.
__label__neu	I bought these after my Avent bottles started to leak. 
__label__neg	At first they were okay, but then my son had trouble feeding from them. 
__label__neg	The flow was too slow and when I made the whole bigger it was too fast. 
__label__neg	Also you have to check every new nipple to make sure there is a hole at all! 
__label__neg	IF you tighten the bottom too much, the baby can't get any milk. 
__label__neg	Whenever I used these, I kept having to stop my son from eating to make sure he was not just sucking air. 
__label__neg	Also the nipple collapes ALL THE TIME. 
__label__pos	Try the Playtex Premium Nurser. 
__label__pos	It works much better.
__label__pos	I ordered this to have for 2yr old granddaughter, while it is easy to put together. 
__label__neu	 The step is at a angle, and the seat did fit or cove the toilet. 
__label__neg	 I sent this back the exact same day, because its a piece of junk.
__label__neu	(...)When your child outgrows the infant bath (between two and six months, depending on size and activeness), get a bigger baby bath. 
__label__neu	There are several models (though none via Amazon, that I see) that rock, including one we found that's inflatable - it holds thrice the water of the infant bath but still a small fraction of what's needed in the entire tub. 
__label__neg	Besides, you want the water to flow and be replaced for a baby, NOT have an infant or toddler sitting in a tub full of dirty and soapy water, which may contribute to genital and rectal problems. 
__label__neg	Related: With this seat, you either suspend the baby *above* the water or waste dozens of gallons getting the water line high enough to *reach* the baby. 
__label__neg	Either way, the baby's butt is inside a chair and difficult to reach or see, much less clean. 
__label__neu	Still not sure? 
__label__neu	Try wiping his or her buttcrack while they're in a high chair. 
__label__neg	You'll instantly realize that a chair such as this is *not* the best way to bath a child.
__label__neu	We received this monitor as a gift and did not open the monitor until a couple of months after the baby arrived. 
__label__neg	The hand held unit did not work. 
__label__neu	We called Safety 1st and were told that a tiny piece of plastic (part of the plastic that protects the battery when it's in the store0 would break off inside the battery holder. 
__label__pos	We removed it and it works. 
__label__neg	The customer service is about the best thing I can say for this monitor. 
__label__neg	 Our monitor seems to be very fuzzy; it picks up lots of white noise. 
__label__neg	There is not much difference between the loudest and softest volume. 
__label__neg	If the ceiling fan, air conditioner, or air purifier are on, you hear static. 
__label__neg	Aside from this, our baby usually cries loud enough to hear her without the monitor. 
__label__neu	We live in a small house and really bought this for when we are outside. 
__label__neu	A video monitor would have suited us more to see if she has squirmed herself into the corner of the crib or just protesting sleep.
__label__neu	I registered and received this gift for my baby shower. 
__label__pos	 I put it on the car seat and was looking forward to bringing my baby home in it. 
__label__neu	 Fortunately, my hospital has a car seat safety inspection station and they told me to take the Bundle Me off immediately. 
__label__neu	 They say because the Bundle Me goes under the baby it interferes with the safety restraints. 
__label__neu	 The straps that go around the baby may appear to be tight, but the Bundle Me may actually bunched up under the straps and therefore the restraints aren't as tight as they should be. 
__label__neg	 Then God-forbid there was an accident, the force could cause the Bundle Me to shift-- loosening the restraints and baby could come lose. 
__label__neg	 Kinda defeats the purpose of a car seat if you ask me. 
__label__neu	 When there are so many safe covers (the ones that are elastic and go over the car seat, but not under the baby-- for example the Eddie Bauer Carrier Cover, which is what we ended up with), why take the chance? 
__label__neg	 I'd rather error on the side of safety.
__label__neu	I purchased Dr. 
__label__neu	Brown's bottles for my daughter. 
__label__neg	The idea behind the vent is great but what a pain to put together! 
__label__neg	With a very fussy newborn, I did not have time to waste assembling the bottle. 
__label__pos	We discovered that Evenflo and Avent bottles work just as well and are cheaper.
__label__neu	I registered and recevied these baskets for my baby shower. 
__label__pos	I thought the were cute and would look cute in my sons room. 
__label__neu	I had planned to use them to hold diapers and baby toiletries. 
__label__neg	They would nave even worked nicely as little toy baskets, but I will not use them. 
__label__neg	The paint chips off VERY eaisly. 
__label__neg	It makes a mess of the whole house and fills up the baskets. 
__label__neg	I wouldn't want to put anything of my sons in them for fear paint chips would get on his things. 
__label__neg	I thought they would be better quality considering the price. 
__label__neg	Don't waste your money.
__label__neu	I registered for this pump because I planned to only pump on rare occasions, so I thought it would be silly to spend the money for an electric pump... 
__label__neg	Big Mistake. 
__label__neg	This manual pump takes much longer to assemble, has more parts to clean and reassemble, and pumps significantly less milk than the Medela DoubleEase I replaced it with. 
__label__neg	Granted, there is a big difference in price, but when you're only getting 2 hours sleep at a time, the laundry is piling up, you haven't had time to go to the store or prepare dinner, and you haven't even had the energy to bathe yourself (welcome to motherhood), it seems worth the extra money to me to have a pump I can assemble in less than 10 seconds, get 4 oz. 
__label__neu	of milk in 5 minutes, and still have one arm free to hold baby.
__label__pos	I must admit, this is the first potty seat that my son can sit on where the pee doesn't fly over the top the seat. 
__label__neg	 I was really happy with the seat up until I picked it up... 
__label__neg	The seat, unfortunately, catches all the pee on the underside, causing the toilet seat to be pee covered, the potty seat underside to be pee covered, and the seat to leak out pee once you pick the thing up. 
__label__neg	 While I'm happy that the seat works - I hate it because I still need to clean things up when my kid gets off the seat. 
__label__pos	In comparison to the other seats I've purchased, this seat is the best because less pee gets on the floor - I might just have to try putting silicon around the base to keep it from filling with pee though... 
__label__pos	UPDATE:  I sealed all the edges of the seat with some silicon caulking (got it from Lowes for $3) and now the pee goes where it's supposed to go - into the toilet! 
__label__pos	 Just because of that, I would actually raise it a star for use, but it's a DIY star. 
__label__pos	 If you're willing to go that extra mile, this seat works great.
__label__neg	I am afraid to let the baby chew on this as it is made of FDA approved Santoprene. 
__label__neg	Well that's great and all but didn't the FDA approve baby formula and other such items that were found to contain melamine?! 
__label__neu	 And I searched for santoprene and it's apparently made by ExxonMobil Chemical co.!! 
__label__neu	 So I am going to guess that it has petroleum products in it. 
__label__neg	 I am not going to let my baby chew on this since I am not too sure the FDA isn't 'in bed' with Exxon. 
__label__pos	 It is the perfect size and shape too! 
__label__neg	 If only they would have a non-toxic (no BPA, pthalates etc) version of this same design!
__label__neg	I purchased these at Baby's R Us because of the good reviews, but I have not had any luck with them. 
__label__neg	 They didn't pull the nipple out far enough to make any difference, and the pressure on the nipple made me leak constantly. 
__label__neg	 I would soak through a cloth pad in a couple of hours. 
__label__neg	 They are suppose to have a reservoir to catch the milk, but your nipple must protrude a certain distance in order for the shell to work. 
__label__neg	 My nipples were too flat, so I just ended up with wet, smelly breasts. 
__label__neg	They are also very large and extremely noticeable - there is no way I would wear them in public. 
__label__neu	I also think a previous reviewer got the medela shell types mixed up. 
__label__neu	 This shell does not have a foam insert, and is hard plastic.
__label__pos	Maybe if you are not into the flashing lights, and the music, this would work great. 
__label__neg	 For me, I would like ot be able to keep my baby occupied while I get a couple of things done, and at this stage (3 months), this still didn't do the trick. 
__label__neg	 She jsut looked at it, expected it to do something when she kicked nothing happened, so boredom set ini. 
__label__neg	I brought it back. 
__label__neu	 She has a kick and play bouncer... 
__label__pos	thank heavens. 
__label__pos	 It keeps her busy for up to an hour before she starts fussing. 
__label__neu	(see my review)
__label__neg	Why does everyone think you need this thing? 
__label__neu	Of course, we thought so. 
__label__neu	 We have used it five or six times. 
__label__neg	 We ruined two packs of refills just trying to figure out how to use it. 
__label__neg	 Once we got the hang of it, we realized it's pretty useless. 
__label__neg	 It does work to keep odor out I suppose, but so does a plastic bag. 
__label__neg	Just put your diaper in a plastic bag!
__label__neg	I bought this and returned it the next day. 
__label__neg	The mat is so thin. 
__label__neg	I had nothing but problems trying to keep it from falling apart while my daughter played with it...and yes, it was put together properly. 
__label__neg	As far as being portable....that's a joke. 
__label__neg	Don't waste your money or time on the gym.
__label__neu	I had bought this for my son at 6 months old for visiting graqndparents. 
__label__neg	 I really liked the features, but didn't like it once i put my son in it. 
__label__pos	 I loved the idea that it folded up, had a carrying strap, could come apart easily to clean, and the different trays. 
__label__neu	 I thought that the back could be a little higher, he still needed some support, and couldn't sit straight up. 
__label__neu	 Also he is an average size baby, and when i put him in the seat he had just fit, and the seat looked really small with him in it. 
__label__neg	 I returned and bought him a reclining seat with a higher back.
__label__neg	We bought this cup for our 6 month old and from the very beginning it leaked. 
__label__neg	 The nipple was very soft and my daughter seemed to enjoy biting it more than using it to drink. 
__label__neg	 But when she would tilt it back all the water would just soak her neck and shirt. 
__label__neg	 I could never give her this cup without her shirt being soaked. 
__label__neg	 Also it would leak in the diaper bag as well. 
__label__neg	 Very disappointed... 
__label__neg	currently searching for a new cup to transition from bottle.
__label__neu	I'm an exclusive pumper, so in addition to bottles and nipples, I also have lots of pump parts to deal with. 
__label__neg	This spacious bottle rack looked like it would be the answer to all my problems!Sadly, my dreams of an organized countertop, with bottles drying neatly on a rack rather than an assortment of paper towels, were not to be. 
__label__pos	I brought this home, popped it in the dishwasher to sterilize it before using, and took it out, eager to assemble it. 
__label__neg	Unfortunately, not one but TWO of the pieces that snap together to keep the whole unit in one piece had broken. 
__label__neg	I immediately took the item back to the store. 
__label__neg	Very disappointing (and my kitchen is still a mess, too).
__label__neg	We really need a footed sleep sack for our baby now that the temps are getting colder but I have no options because this comes in only size L or XL, the large saying 12-18 months which should fit my son but it is the hugest thing. 
__label__neg	It literally could fit a 2 year old toddler. 
__label__neg	My husband said he knew a very short adult woman in college who could easily wear it, it's that big. 
__label__neu	And my son is really long. 
__label__neu	He's 99th percentile in length. 
__label__neu	He is wearing 12-18 month clothes at 8 months old. 
__label__neu	He is in the range for length that's noted for this sleep sack. 
__label__neg	Halo needs to get their sizing in line with standard clothing sizing for babies and they need to offer a smaller size in this item. 
__label__neu	I'm not putting him in a sleep sack without feet because he flips over a lot sleeping and loves to move his legs where he wants them, up on the bars of the crib, etc, and I know a closed sack would bother him and keep him awake. 
__label__neg	I went ahead and kept this but we'll be using it a year from now when he's 2! 
__label__neg	Seriously.
__label__pos	I loved these bottles for the first month I had my daughter. 
__label__neg	 I went and bought about 10 from Babies R Us, and after 2 weeks, 8 of the slow-flow nipples didn't work. 
__label__neg	 They get clogged very easily and forget putting them in the dishwasher- the holes seal shut. 
__label__neg	 I called Playtex about this and they agreed to send me 6 new nipples if I sent them back 8 (?). 
__label__neg	 Now I will have 8 bottles with 6 nipples, which will probably just end up clogging again. 
__label__neg	 The drop-in liner idea is great and does reduce air bubbles, but I can't afford to pay for new nipples every 2 weeks.
__label__neg	First of all, you should not install this in your car as it can become a projectile in an accident (as the police officer who installed my car seat told me.)Second of all, When you buy this mirror it comes with a 'protective' piece of plastic over the mirror that you have to remove to use the mirror, but when you remove it, you see that the mirror is very foggy. 
__label__neg	I tried cleaning the mirror with water and a soft cloth, thinking that it was just some adhesive from the plastic, but it made it worse. 
__label__neg	Now the mirror is foggy, scratchy, and totally unuseable. 
__label__neg	It's going back to the store today.
__label__neg	I got these to replace my previously leaky Avent bottles, and they also leak. 
__label__neg	 A lot. 
__label__neg	 I'd never buy from Avent again, or use anything from Avent again. 
__label__neg	 I threw these out and bought Dr. 
__label__neu	Browns.
__label__neg	The sling is too small for my my 12 weeks old daughter. 
__label__neg	It's hard to hold her steady in the tub because it is too slippery. 
__label__neg	The spray is useless. 
__label__neg	it's like it is tangling my fingers when i press to spray, too difficult to hold, should've made it bigger.i think i will return this item because i can't really give her a bath in this tub.
__label__pos	I registered for this tub because I thought it is very cool and so multi-functional. 
__label__neg	After the baby was born and passed his stage of dry bath, I found this tub is not very easy to use. 
__label__neg	 My husband and I coudln't solve the leaking issue. 
__label__neg	 It also difficult for me to expand or close the tub. 
__label__neg	The sling is not very good, either. 
__label__neg	I tried to use this tub for 3 times and returned it. 
__label__pos	 I got Sure Comfort Deluxe instead. 
__label__pos	 I think Sure Comfort Deluxe is a much better choice for new born. 
__label__pos	 It is very easy to put over my sink. 
__label__pos	 The green net comes with the tub is easy to use.
__label__pos	I got this because I also purchased 2 other items from Tiny Love and thought very highly of the concept behind their products. 
__label__neg	 Unfortunately, I read many reviews about this having a tiny mirror, hard to install, and difficult for the baby to reach....well, I really should have listened to all those horrible reviews....this sits in my car but isn't hooked up or anything. 
__label__neg	 I put my old car mirror back up & just gave up on this product. 
__label__pos	 However, the other TINY LOVE products I bought were AWESOME & I would highly recommend them (musical arch & car seat mobile)... 
__label__neg	I guess not EVERY product from a company is going to meet expectations. 
__label__neg	 Please listen to all the negative results on this one & don't buy it.
__label__neu	We had the older model that was also round looking with two fish. 
__label__neg	My daughter loved it but the gears came off and it started clicking and the fish wouldn't move anymore. 
__label__pos	 The square looking model was tacky looking to me so I was so happy to see this one now that I have a new baby  b/c I thought it looked similar to the original model. 
__label__neg	The battery pack fell off the crib and broke the first time I tried to put it on. 
__label__neu	If you have a Next Generation or any other large, sleigh type crib.forget it. 
__label__neg	There is no way to attach it. 
__label__neg	 I had to set it in a corner and tie the straps to the crib with fishing line. 
__label__neg	They need to make the straps way longer(test this on different types of cribs). 
__label__neg	Next problem....it needs more water in front of the toys. 
__label__neg	It is obvious they are not in the water(not a problem on the older model), it would make better bubbles too. 
__label__pos	I like the fish and the music.
__label__neu	I knew it was silly to spend so much on a teether, but I had tried so many other teethers and none of them worked. 
__label__pos	I read the amazon reviews and couldn't wait to get Sophie. 
__label__neu	Unfortunately, it didn't work for my baby. 
__label__neu	My baby just doesn't seem to chew on things for teething relief. 
__label__neg	If your baby does chew when teething I can see how it would be a winner, but it's not the magical teether it's made out to be. 
__label__neg	The only thing that's working for us is Orajel and Tylenol.
__label__neu	I bought this before my daughter was born thinking that the 'heartbeat' sound would be soothing for her. 
__label__pos	 I liked this better than the teddy bears with the heartbeat sound because it also had other soothing sounds that my husband and I might enjoy as well. 
__label__neg	I hated every sound it made. 
__label__neg	 The heartbeat was loud and annoying. 
__label__neg	 All the other 'natural' sounds seemed very unnatural and mechanical. 
__label__neg	 My baby slept much better when I stopped using this. 
__label__neg	 If you want nature sounds, I suggest you invest something other than this product. 
__label__neu	We now use an old clock radio tuned to AM static and it works better than anything else.
__label__neg	We got this and the Diaper Decor Plus as gifts and I have to say that the Champ is not my favorite. 
__label__pos	I like that you can use your own garbage bags with the Champ, but that's the only positive in my opinion. 
__label__neg	I find it pretty hard to open it without breaking a nail and it does get fill up much more quickly than the Decor. 
__label__neg	When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier. 
__label__neg	I also like the Decor because you can dispose of the diaper with your foot, instead of a hand like with the Champ, because now that my son is super squirmy on the changing table, I need of my hands on him!
__label__neg	Too loud. 
__label__neg	Too hard. 
__label__neg	Buttons don't depress easily or distinctly. 
__label__neg	My 6 month old has fallen headfirst onto the cube and has cut her forehead and chin and jaw on the hard(!) unpadded edges. 
__label__neg	The corners have sufficient covers but why not the edges between corners??? 
__label__neg	Buttons require too much strength to push for a 6 month old. 
__label__neu	She can sometimes manage it her feet if cube is braced against other object. 
__label__neg	Definitely NOT for under 1 year olds. 
__label__neu	Battery replacement requires screwdriver. 
__label__neu	Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube
__label__neg	more of a toy than a teether and it does have a horrible smell that we cant cure.... 
__label__neg	Ive hand and dishwashered it more than 20 times!
__label__neg	I'm not sure what the fuss is surrounding this product and why so many deem it a 'must-have'  I find that a regular firm pillow works just as well if not better. 
__label__neg	 The width of the boppy is too narrow to support a bigger baby. 
__label__neg	 The U-shape isn't especially comfortable to me. 
__label__neg	 The other problem I've had is washing. 
__label__neg	 They come with slip covers now, but if you ever need to wash the pillow itself, it screws up the distribution of the stuffing. 
__label__pos	I much prefer the My Breast Friend pillow: it has a back support and is adjustable. 
__label__pos	 Very comfortable and gives the baby a wider and flater surface to lay on. 
__label__pos	 Mine is the inflatable version, which is great - when you take off the cover to wash, you can easily clean the pillow beneith with just a damp cloth. 
__label__pos	 My baby also like sitting in it better than the boppy.
__label__neu	I bought this mirror because it was far larger than the adjustable suction-cup mirror I had on the rear windshield of my car. 
__label__neg	I discovered negative #1 in the store: it uses a giant safety pin (as well as a strap) to attach to the seatback. 
__label__neg	My car has a leather interior, and the last thing I wanted to do was poke holes in the leather! 
__label__neg	I tried just using the strap, but that is supposed to go around the headrest, and there is no headrest for the center of the backseat, just the right and left sides. 
__label__neg	Since the safest place for a baby is in the headrest-less center, the strap was out. 
__label__neu	There was also a velcro tape that we could use to stick the mirror onto the seatback. 
__label__neg	The negatives there were a) sticky glue residue on the leather and b) when we need to fold down the rear seat for transporting bikes or something equally large, the rear seat would fold precisely right down where the mirror would be, so we'd be constantly removing it and the velcro tape and then reattaching it. 
__label__neg	Highly impractical for any vehicle with a leather interior or with a rear seat that folds down in the middle. 
__label__neg	I suppose it's okay for a fabric-covered seat or for  a small car that doesn't have fold-down rear seats, but for an SUV or minivan it's really not usable.
__label__neg	I echo all of the problems pointed out by the negative reviews: the shower sprayer has never worked, and the tub is too short with the sprayer unit in place in the tub. 
__label__neg	 I'd add that the plug leaks, which is more than an inconvenience. 
__label__neg	 Also, the hammock has torn, even though our baby is well within the weight limit. 
__label__neg	 Overall, I'd say this is one of the most disappointing products we have purchased since the birth of our two month old baby. 
__label__neg	 Don't waste your money!
__label__neu	Well, I have had this set for a several months. 
__label__neg	 I generally use them every night in the dishwasher, but I'll be throwing them out soon. 
__label__neg	 There is a metal rod in the hinge that is rusting on the large mesh rack. 
__label__pos	 The small one has the same rod but for whatever reason, it is doing fine. 
__label__neg	Also, these lie flat in the dishwasher, taking up much room. 
__label__pos	 I prefer the Munchkin brand of dishwasher basket. 
__label__pos	 It is tall, and allows better use of space. 
__label__pos	 It also holds a lot more, and has no metal pieces whatsoever.
__label__neg	Not a very good cloth diaper. 
__label__neg	 The inserts are very inefficient in pulling moisture away from the baby's  bottom. 
__label__neg	This can result in diaper rashes. 
__label__neg	You might as well use prefolds and use a cover and save LOTS of money rather than use these diapers. 
__label__neg	Besides all the leaks with this diaper, they are really stiff. 
__label__neg	 I wanted to like this diaper, but am very disappointed. 
__label__pos	 We are much happier with Happy Heiny's and BumGenius for All-In-Ones.
__label__neu	The design of this changing pad is wonderful but the cover needs to be more durable. 
__label__neu	Pro's*Padded & Comfy*4 Sided-this keeps baby from accidently bumping their head*Easy to wipe clean*Bottom is skid proofCon's*cover gets holes easily. 
__label__neg	With less than 1 year of use the cover has gotten several cracks along the tops of the sides. 
__label__neg	We used a nice pad cover too.*the seams are coming apart-this is the top of the pad so if baby pee's it could go into the holes and would be impossible to get cleaned out. 
__label__neu	So even though this has many Pro's I would recommend getting something else if you are wanting to have something to last more than a year w/out any problems. 
__label__neg	This is one of the more expensive changing pads so you would expect it to be more durable. 
__label__neg	I would NEVER buy this again unless I knew they changed the cover & made it more durable. 
__label__neg	If I had written a review on this item the first few months I had it, I would have given it 5 stars and only praises. 
__label__neg	A few months later I would have changed my mind and deleted that review when it started getting holes.
__label__neg	The bobby was way too cumbersome for nursing. 
__label__neu	 It was given to me as a gift, a lot of people said great things about it and I registered for it before my baby was due. 
__label__neg	 In the beginning, I would spend a lot of time trying to get the boppy comfortable around me and in place before someone handed me my daughter during feeding times. 
__label__neg	 Now I just grab my daughter, go to a chair/couch and find a comfortable pillow and do just fine without a boppy! 
__label__neg	 The boppy is collecting dust. 
__label__pos	 Pillows work just fine!UPDATE: after 2 years and 2 babies, the Boppy is now my favorite for when the baby is around 5 months old-7 months: for putting behind them for sitting up! 
__label__pos	 I still can't stand the boppy for nursing, but I really love it for a cushion when they are sitting up!
__label__pos	This is a cute toy, I will give them that. 
__label__neu	And I didnt realize until much later that it played music. 
__label__neg	But it doesnt clip to ANYTHING. 
__label__neg	We have yet to find something that this toy will clip too. 
__label__neg	It collapses on everything, it falls on her. 
__label__neg	We ended up taking the toys off of it and hanging them from other things. 
__label__neg	We could have done that with toys she already had. 
__label__neg	This was a waste of money.
__label__neg	The Diaper Genie is the worst piece of crap I have ever used. 
__label__neg	When it works it is fine, but the stupid inner funnel ring has broken and had to be replaced 3 times already. 
__label__neg	The people at Playtex were very nice about replacing it, but come on! 
__label__neg	Do you know how many diapers a baby goes through between the time this thing breaks and the time a replacement part arrives? 
__label__neg	We didn't even do anything to hurt the ring, sometimes if you just open the unit too roughly it will shear the edges and then it won't fit back in the top. 
__label__neg	We have given up and bought a diaper champ.
__label__neg	I have to agree with the other reviewers about this being more toy like than serious potty training. 
__label__pos	 My daughter loves sticking her hand in the bowl to make it play the song and she loves taking the bowl out. 
__label__neg	 There are times when she doesn't go and the music goes off which is confusing. 
__label__neu	 I will probably buy another one just so she can distinguish the difference. 
__label__neg	 Once she figured out she could make it play without going potty she quit using it.
__label__neg	Perhaps it's because we live in a high traffic area, but we have nothing but static using this monitor. 
__label__neg	If you walk by the receiver using the cordless or cellphone it completely loses all reception and all you hear is static. 
__label__neg	The receiver also seems to have trouble around our direct tv boxes. 
__label__neg	With all the electronic gidgets and gadgets out there spend the money and get the higher end models that really do block out interference. 
__label__neg	The real kicker of this was I was asleep one night while my husband was out working and I heard a males voice in the monitor. 
__label__neg	I immediately freaked out thinking someone broke into the house and was in the baby's room. 
__label__neu	I jumped out of bed and was ready to run into the baby's room when I heard the guy talking to a girl in what appeared to be a cell phone conversation from who knows where. 
__label__neg	Talk about almost having a heart attack on the spot!FP should just stop making this model period.
__label__neg	Bottom line this is not worth the money - the interference and feedback is way too much - even in a house with no other houses nearby. 
__label__neg	 Also it has a noise alert but no sensitivity function - so every time the baby makes a peep in turns on - which anyone who has a newborn will tell you means its going on every 10 seconds. 
__label__neg	 The bottom line is you want a monitor that lets you decide what you want to hear this does not let you do that. 
__label__neg	 Buy the Avent instead its has a great sensitivity function for only slightly more money.
__label__neu	I purchased this item thinking it would be perfect for those late night diaper changes. 
__label__neg	 I still think wipes warmers are a good idea, just not this one! 
__label__neu	This warmer heats from the bottom. 
__label__neu	I quickly noticed the wipes at the bottom were warmer than the ones at the top. 
__label__neg	I also noticed that the wipes at the top were a bit dried out and soapy feeling. 
__label__neg	I returned the warmer and found the PERFECT warmer at a TARGET store. 
__label__pos	 The target warmer heats from the top to the bottom, which keeps the top wipes moist and warm, just as they should be. 
__label__pos	 It was a little cheaper in price and it has a lid lock that the other didn't have. 
__label__pos	 All around it is a better purchase!
__label__neg	There are two sound settings on the little learning table - one is way too loud (could easily damage your babies ears) and the other setting is way too low (can't hear it at all).
__label__neg	I'm disappointed in this chair because I think Baby Trend usually makes good products. 
__label__neg	While it is easy to use, it seems geared toward bigger kids. 
__label__neg	My 10-month old always falls to the side of the chair and the tray is too high on her chest (she's average height and has been sitting up for months). 
__label__neu	I have been able to get food stains out of the fabric by washing the entire cover on Delicate cycle and then air-drying. 
__label__neg	However, the cushion on the bottom has bunched up inside the fabric and I have not been able to flatten it out. 
__label__pos	My nephew has a Graco Contempo, which my daughter has used, and I like it much better because she sits up higher and the tray comes right to her at the appropriate height. 
__label__neg	When my daughter is done with this chair, I think I'll sell it in a garage sale and get a Graco for the next kid.
__label__neu	I don't hate this pacifier really. 
__label__neu	I don't have much experience with pacifiers to judge. 
__label__neg	 Here is why I don't like this though.1. 
__label__neg	My son won't suck for more than a few minutes. 
__label__pos	He has an Avent one he will suck for a long time though. 
__label__neg	 Upon comparison this pacifier has a much shorter sucking part-- the clear part that goes in their mouth. 
__label__neg	 I think that's why he doesn't like it. 
__label__neg	 It also has a weird dent in that same part that matches the bottles. 
__label__neu	I have a bottle but haven't tried it yet.2. 
__label__neg	It leaves red indents on his cheeks. 
__label__neg	 It has a very prominent curve to it which causes this. 
__label__neu	I called the 800 number and a very nice sounding lady told me that that's what happens when you use pacifiers...is this true? 
__label__neu	I have no idea really. 
__label__pos	 I do know that his Avent pacifier does not do this. 
__label__neu	 That one is more straight.3. 
__label__neg	The Avent comes with a little clip on cover, these do not so they are inconvenient to travel with.
__label__pos	I registered for this thinking it would be great. 
__label__pos	 Everything I need. 
__label__neg	 RIIIIGHHHTTT.. 
__label__neu	haha.. 
__label__neg	The only things in it I can use are the nail clippers (but I cannot use the magnification because it distorts everything and I cannot see my sons nails),  the hair brush which is nice, the comb which is nice, and the nail files which I dont like anyways because the chalkboard scrapping sound lol. 
__label__neg	 The thermometer [stinks]! 
__label__neg	 It doesn't beep so you dont know wen its done. 
__label__neg	 You have to watch for it to blink or something like that and it only blinks a few times so if u miss it ur gonna sit there for a LOOOONNG time but hey it takes a long time to work anyways. 
__label__neg	 The medicine dropper is TOO hard to pull out and push in. 
__label__neg	And the tweezers are very flimsy
__label__neg	Within less than 1 week, the mirror fogged up. 
__label__neg	 I followed the cleaning instructions that accompanied the mirror, but to my dismay, nothing worked. 
__label__neg	 Please, do not buy this product.
__label__neu	I received this item at my baby shower (11/03) and we still have it. 
__label__neg	The doors keep falling off, it fills up fast. 
__label__neg	 My daughter who's into everything have learned how to open the top and remove all the diapers. 
__label__neg	 She know that the door doesn't close and falls apart, so she's always where the plastic bag is. 
__label__neg	 We had to put kidco locks on the top to keep the top from opening and another lock on the door, because when we would open it, it would come out of it's holders. 
__label__neu	 Sure this is a nice pail to keep after the diapers are gone. 
__label__neg	 But, when it has some stinky diapers in it, it stinks and so does her room. 
__label__neg	 I have to put air freshners inside it to help with the odor. 
__label__neg	Not a great pail, it doesn't cost cheap, but it's made cheap.
__label__neg	The SIDS alliance suggests not using anything in the crib, including any of these sleep positioners or wedges, because the baby could kick his way down and suffocate against the foam bars. 
__label__neg	 The truth is that you will probably not need it. 
__label__neu	 Babies naturally sleep on their backs if placed that way. 
__label__neg	 I was given this as a gift when I was in the hospital and when my doctor saw the box he suggested that I return it. 
__label__neg	 He said that these things come in and out of style and for some reason have come back in fashion again, but can be a big risk for SIDS- scary!! 
__label__neg	 My baby is now 4 months old and we have done fine without a product like this.
__label__neg	These don't stick at all! 
__label__neg	My guys ripped them off the sides of the tables the second we put them up. 
__label__neg	The adhesive wouldn't restick either. 
__label__neg	What a waste. 
__label__neg	:(
__label__pos	This and the ultimate wipes warmer where two of the things that I purchased right away because I had read all of the reviews and everyone said they were 'lifesavers'. 
__label__neg	 Well, out of all of the items I have purchased these two were the BIGGEST waste of money and are more of an inconvenience than anything. 
__label__neg	 This warmer needs to be plugged in to stay warm and when unplugged does not stay warm for long. 
__label__neg	 If using these items make sure you always have a warm wipe because your little one gets use to the warm wipes which is not always so convenient when your on the go or traveling. 
__label__neg	 My advice is save your money and buy something your baby REALLY needs.
__label__neu	I bought this primarily for the slip resistance and because it is BPA-free. 
__label__neg	Unfortunately, the slip resistance is all but nonexistent. 
__label__neu	The rim around the bottom of the plate has the equivalent of a rubber band to keep it from skidding. 
__label__neg	I suppose it does offer a tiny bit of resistance, but I'd say it is maybe 10% less likely to be thrown on the floor than any other lightweight plastic plate. 
__label__neg	It is extremely light, just like any cheap plastic baby plate. 
__label__pos	We have been using it for our baby anyway, and she does seem to like the added scoopability with this plate, as it is a bit easier to grab things from the rounded compartments. 
__label__neg	Unless your child has a lot of trouble picking things up from any other plate or bowl, though, I see no reason to buy this plate. 
__label__pos	Edited two years later: We've discovered a much better use for these plates! 
__label__pos	They are a perfect paint tray for my children while they are sitting at the table and painting on paper. 
__label__pos	With a blob of paint in each compartment, and with relatively no slipping (the children know better than to pick them up, but could if they wanted to) these are great for little ones who are into painting. 
__label__pos	I'd really recommend them for that.
__label__neu	I registered for this item because it goes with the changing pad that I chose. 
__label__neu	 I can't believe that this cover is made by the same manufacturer as the pad! 
__label__neg	 It doesn't fit well. 
__label__neg	 It has no holes for the safety straps on the pad to fit through. 
__label__neg	 I cut small holes to pull the straps through, and they were all frayed after just one washing. 
__label__neg	 In fact, the entire cover is already covered with frays and snags after only two weeks of use! 
__label__neg	 The material is rough and cheap. 
__label__neg	 My husband and I have opted for covering the pad with a clean bath towel every day. 
__label__pos	 It's softer and easier. 
__label__neg	 We will look for another option, but until we find one, this cover is not the answer!
__label__neg	I bought two of these and thank goodness BRU let me take them back. 
__label__neg	 They did not grip our leather seats, and actually made the car seat slide around so I took them back, and 3 1/2 years and two more kids later haven't felt like I missed them a bit. 
__label__neg	 These are unecessary and really a pain.
__label__neu	I've heard so many rave reviews that when I lost my Purely Yours, I got this one (my son was not nursing so often by then). 
__label__neg	I was disappointed. 
__label__neg	My hand hurt from having to squeeze the pump. 
__label__neu	I guess I should expect that, given that it's a handheld manual pump. 
__label__neg	Well, I didn't think it would be that tiring. 
__label__neg	Both my hands were tied up when pumping both sides. 
__label__neg	The suction was too much. 
__label__neg	It would release, so I had to let air in every so often so my nipples wouldn't get sucked into the bottle! 
__label__neg	Well, it wasn't that bad, but it really wouldn't release. 
__label__neg	The output wasn't what I'd like, either. 
__label__neu	Maybe I'm just used to the electric variety. 
__label__neu	This pump would be okay for light pumping but not for working moms.
__label__neu	The only good thing about this is the night light function. 
__label__neg	 The waves and water sound horrible and my son never liked listening to the music or the heartbeat sound.
__label__neg	I absolutely hate these cups! 
__label__neg	They are flimsy like another reviewer said. 
__label__neg	My handles haven't come off but they leak from the joints. 
__label__neg	Also, the lid is impossible to line up with the handles if your toddler is crying for milk or water.
__label__neg	My daughter is now 3 months old and has fallen out of this about 4 times. 
__label__neg	 She is strapped in and correctly positioned, but the straps do not hold a baby in place to where she can't fling herself over the side. 
__label__neg	 Just last week I looked over at her and her head was hanging over the side while her feet were still on the bouncer. 
__label__neg	 The toy bar gets old fast, and already she is not interested in it. 
__label__neg	 The only good thing about this chair is the vibration, but definately not worth the $40.
__label__neu	at the head and foot of the sheet there are snaps that can come completely off.one elastic strap end snaps to the sheet then wraps around the crib rail and snaps back onto the sheet. 
__label__neg	if you undo both snaps you are left with a loose elastic band. 
__label__neg	baby could choke on it if you ask me. 
__label__pos	i liked the product for its ease of use.. 
__label__neu	but once i noticed the straps could snap completely off.. 
__label__neg	i stopped using it.
__label__neg	This one is a total waste of plastic. 
__label__neg	I used it once a day and it lasted 7. 
__label__neg	I hate evenflo products but went against my better judgement anyway. 
__label__neg	The motor weakened by the day. 
__label__neg	IT IS LOUD!!! 
__label__neg	ALL NOISE NO WORK! 
__label__neg	I had to squeeze with the motor at the HIGHEST setting to get just a little. 
__label__neg	I would get about a total of 4-5oz after 30-45 min. 
__label__neg	When I called the company(which has the worst hours), they just sent me a bag of parts and said you figure it out. 
__label__neg	It took 2 wks for them to arrive. 
__label__neg	Parts made no difference. 
__label__neg	First they said no return. 
__label__neg	I said like hell you wont. 
__label__neu	Then they said only half the MSRP with me paying shipping. 
__label__neg	I still have the damn thing. 
__label__neg	Not even worth going to the PO for half the price minus shipping. 
__label__neu	I ended up with a free brand new medela hand pump from WIC(if I had only asked from the get go). 
__label__neu	With that one, I got a total of 10oz in 5-10 min. 
__label__neu	Next time around, I will fork out the money for the electric medelas. 
__label__neu	Cost more but they know what they are making.
__label__neu	I bought this for my baby and thought it was awesome until she outgrew the sling which didn't take long at all. 
__label__neg	She cannot sit up on her own yet which means the tub is absolutely useless. 
__label__neg	I am throwing this out and buying something else. 
__label__neg	What a waste of money.
__label__neg	Like most everyone else who owns the UPPAbaby Vista, I HATE the cupholder. 
__label__neg	 I am always bumping it on things and it falls off... 
__label__neg	a couple of times with a drink in it, once with a $4 latte that spilled everywhere. 
__label__neg	:-(  It just simply sticks out too far and isn't secure enough, though it is nice that it folds against the side when not in use (or you can just take it off completely). 
__label__neg	 It would have been better if it attached to the inside of the handle, not the outside. 
__label__neu	 But since I haven't found any other attachable cup holders that work I'm still using this one. 
__label__neu	 I'm just more mindful not to get too close to anything on the side with my drink, and try to use only bottles with caps. 
__label__neg	No more cups without lids.
__label__neg	I bought this pump before leaving the hospital and it was a waste of money. 
__label__neg	It hurt like heck and did not express enough milk to relieve my engorgement. 
__label__neg	The motor cycles very slowly so when it's tugging on me all I can think is ouch...ouch...ouch... 
__label__pos	I ended up buying a used Pump-in-Style online and love it. 
__label__pos	I can pump both sides at once in less than 10 minutes and have a good-sized bottle to show for it.
__label__neg	This monitor is terrible! 
__label__neu	 I was not sure if I wanted to buy another one since our old one worked okay. 
__label__neg	 But, it sucked up 9 volts like you wouldn't believe. 
__label__neu	 I finally decided to buy another and bought this one. 
__label__neg	 It's going back tomorrow and I will buy more 9 volts. 
__label__neg	The static is UNREAL! 
__label__neg	We can't even hear the baby!
__label__neg	We have/had a Graco Quattro and a MetroLite stroller and This doesn't fit on either one!! 
__label__neg	 It was a complete waste of money! 
__label__neg	Try it in the store on a stroller like you own before buying!
__label__neg	These things are hit-or-miss, and we missed with this one. 
__label__neg	I can't say if it's the particular model or what, but of the two times we tried, it didn't stay on.
__label__neg	The only reason why I'm giving this a 1 star is not for the convenience it provides to others, but because it is so not necessary to have...another baby product on the market that is not needed. 
__label__neu	I, being a first time mom, wanted all the baby products out there! 
__label__neu	Well... 
__label__neu	I too read all the reviews for this item, registered for it, and received it as a gift. 
__label__neg	Well...we found absolutely no use for it. 
__label__neu	If you start your baby with warming his milk, then you're only getting him use to it. 
__label__neu	I'm sure most everyone either receives the Arrowhead or Sparkletts (or other) bottled water in their homes...well, the water is already at room tempreature...no need to 'warm' it up in the bottle warmer device...just add your formula in the bottle, shake and give to your baby! 
__label__neu	It's already leukewarm. 
__label__neu	The only time I warm up the bottle is if it's been in the fridge...at that point, I just run it under hot water to warm it up. 
__label__neg	My baby does not have 5+ mins to wait...nor do I! 
__label__neg	Save your $$ and/or those of your friends/family who get it for you!
__label__neu	I tried putting the Dr. 
__label__neg	Brown's bottle (7oz) with nipple and cap in this tote and it doesn't fit. 
__label__neu	 The tote is about 1 inch too short.
__label__neg	I feel bad that I purchased this product only to throw it in a landfill...regrets. 
__label__neg	It is a terrible product. 
__label__neg	It jams all the time, which requires two hands (a safety hazard while changing a baby). 
__label__neg	I now use a garbage can with a lid and change it frequently--a much simpler solution. 
__label__neg	Don't buy this big plastic piece of junk.
__label__neg	I have a few issues with this pillow. 
__label__neg	First, it is really expensive for a body pillow, but I figured Boppy would not steer me wrong. 
__label__neg	Like other reviewers, I feel that it is not firm enough to support the hips and I just don't find it comfortable enough to use as a neck pillow. 
__label__neg	Also, there is no cushion for supporting the belly whatsoever, so if that is what you are looking for do not buy this item. 
__label__neu	I've been sleeping with it for about 2 months now and what I have found helpful is that it prevents me from rolling on my back if I use it with the 'belly support' on my back side.
__label__pos	I was so excited to try these out since they really do seem like the perfect thing for typically breastfed babies. 
__label__neg	 Maybe we just got a bad batch or something, but I hate these bottles. 
__label__neg	The outer nipple is designed to feel like a breast, but when my 3 month old gets it into her mouth it collapses onto itself, then the suction from trying to drink from it and the milk gathered in the nipple seem to create some kind of vacuum and make it hard for her to drink. 
__label__neu	At least that's what it looks like to me. 
__label__neg	Maybe she just hates them and is fighting me on it. 
__label__neg	 This also seems to be one of the worst bottles that I've tried as far as air getting into the bottle and making baby uncomfortable. 
__label__neg	 Since my daughter has/had some reflux and gas issues, it was a no-go for us. 
__label__neg	 I also used ours pretty rarely and at least two of them (out of the starter set) have cracked already. 
__label__neg	 They don't leak yet, but there are little fissures in a sunburst pattern on the bottom of the bottles. 
__label__neg	 The plastic feels pretty thin and cheap, and apparently it is. 
__label__neg	 It seemed like a good idea, but the quality leaves a lot to be desired, and the design, for whatever reason, isn't working out for us.
__label__neu	This thing smells,  is a waste of plastic,  and not mommy-easy for when you want to get rid of that dirty diaper while you have a child moving around on the table and only one free hand.
__label__neu	I have resorted to using my grocery bags for the smelly diapers and wrapping them to throw in the main garbage.
__label__neu	Then the wet diapers get tossed to the regular garbage and taken out daily.
__label__neg	This is far better than even thinking that I have this wonderful thing that is never supposed to smell.
__label__neu	It is horrible.
__label__neg	A friend recommended a wipe warmer after he got one for his 4th child.
__label__neg	Since the Especially For Baby one seemed a reasonable price,  we experimented with it.
__label__neu	Unfortunately,  it doesn't work well with either of the wipes we tried - Pampers or Huggies.
__label__neu	"And the extra storage just didn't provide much ""storage""."
