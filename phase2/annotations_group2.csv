I had a Safety 1st potty that I just hated before I bought this Baby Bjorn potty.,1,0,1122422400B000056J7KA3GJ0RDALQQT5G
"It leaked, its round opening was WAY too small, and I had a ton of problems with my son leaking all over the front and on to the floor.",1,0,1122422400B000056J7KA3GJ0RDALQQT5G
Plus it came apart in many pieces and had lots of spots bacteria could hide.,2,0,1122422400B000056J7KA3GJ0RDALQQT5G
The Baby Bjorn takes care of all the problems I had with the Safety 1st potty.,0,1,1122422400B000056J7KA3GJ0RDALQQT5G
The simple construction is so sanitary and easy to clean.,0,1,1122422400B000056J7KA3GJ0RDALQQT5G
There are no little places for bacteria to collect.,2,1,1122422400B000056J7KA3GJ0RDALQQT5G
"The opening is bigger than other potty chairs and oblong instead of round, so no more pooping on the seat.",2,1,1122422400B000056J7KA3GJ0RDALQQT5G
This alone would have sold me on this potty.,2,1,1122422400B000056J7KA3GJ0RDALQQT5G
The splash guard is great for boys.,0,1,1122422400B000056J7KA3GJ0RDALQQT5G
No more peeing off the front of the potty and no flimsy detachable splash guards that flip down into the seat.,2,1,1122422400B000056J7KA3GJ0RDALQQT5G
It has a nice rubber grip on the bottom to keep it in the same place on the floor.,0,1,1122422400B000056J7KA3GJ0RDALQQT5G
Another plus is that it's nice looking and blends in with the rest of the bathroom.,0,1,1122422400B000056J7KA3GJ0RDALQQT5G
I'm very happy with the quality and design of this potty and I have NO complaints!,0,1,1122422400B000056J7KA3GJ0RDALQQT5G
I love this co-sleeper because I have a one-bedroom apartment and I prefer bedsharing to a crib.,0,1,1253318400B000HKY1GMA1YHI49AWYNI34
The co-sleeper is great for my daughter to sleep or rest in.,0,1,1253318400B000HKY1GMA1YHI49AWYNI34
She's always close by because I can wheel it around the apartment.,2,1,1253318400B000HKY1GMA1YHI49AWYNI34
"and it has tons of storage, which is also a huge help.",0,1,1253318400B000HKY1GMA1YHI49AWYNI34
It's extremely portable and fits into a small bag.,0,1,1253318400B000HKY1GMA1YHI49AWYNI34
It's easy to assemble and take apart.,0,1,1253318400B000HKY1GMA1YHI49AWYNI34
And it has excellent safety features.,0,1,1253318400B000HKY1GMA1YHI49AWYNI34
I'm going to keep this stored in the closet to use with any more new babies we have.,2,1,1253318400B000HKY1GMA1YHI49AWYNI34
I wish i would have brought this to the hospital with me when i was struggling to the point of tears with nursing.,0,1,1122595200B000231GEOA2D6B8N0CTJ28L
Now at 11 weeks old I use the Boppy to nurse everyday and night.,0,1,1122595200B000231GEOA2D6B8N0CTJ28L
I use it so much I had to buy a second one to use upstairs in the middle of the night.,0,1,1122595200B000231GEOA2D6B8N0CTJ28L
The covers and pillows are washable although I haven't washed the pillow yet i have washed the covers several times and they are holding up great.,0,1,1122595200B000231GEOA2D6B8N0CTJ28L
I use this to nurse and to play because it is great to put the boppy by my knees and then the baby can see my face and it is easy to get her to smile using the boppy for support.,0,1,1122595200B000231GEOA2D6B8N0CTJ28L
We got this water mat when my twins were very small - 3 months maybe?,2,1,1245801600B000E82WRMA2QANOGP5LLPBQ
We would prop them up in bobby pillows and put the mat in between them and they liked leaning over to feel the mat.,2,1,1245801600B000E82WRMA2QANOGP5LLPBQ
"The ""fish"" (toys) inside did not move as much as I thought - maybe we didn't have it filled up right.",1,1,1245801600B000E82WRMA2QANOGP5LLPBQ
"Then, once they were sitting up on their own, we would sit them on the mat.",2,1,1245801600B000E82WRMA2QANOGP5LLPBQ
we said they were sitting in their pool.,2,1,1245801600B000E82WRMA2QANOGP5LLPBQ
and they enjoyed that.,2,1,1245801600B000E82WRMA2QANOGP5LLPBQ
"Eventually, one of them punctured it and we didn't try to put a patch on it.",1,1,1245801600B000E82WRMA2QANOGP5LLPBQ
We use the floating toys in the bath tub now ;),0,1,1245801600B000E82WRMA2QANOGP5LLPBQ
"I bought this as 2nd stroller, to park and short errand for my 4 months baby.",2,1,1255564800B000FFS9VMA2661SA1L2OEL6

)OverviewOverall I am happy with my purchase.,0,1,1255564800B000FFS9VMA2661SA1L2OEL6
and YES i would recommend to anyone if they have shorter legs!,0,1,1255564800B000FFS9VMA2661SA1L2OEL6
We bought this primarily because it had better reviews than the Diaper Genie when we bought it and that we don't have to buy special bags.,2,0,1135814400B00003TL7PA19EF05WDNULJS
I love that you can use trash bags.,0,0,1135814400B00003TL7PA19EF05WDNULJS
I haven't had a problem with the bag not being full enough.,2,0,1135814400B00003TL7PA19EF05WDNULJS
"For one, when the Champ is full the trash bag is a bit more then half full, but is also very heavy so you wouldn't want anymore diapers in there anyway.",2,1,1135814400B00003TL7PA19EF05WDNULJS
The only problem I've found with it was when my sister-in-law put my 2 year old nieces diaper in there and the smell lingered a bit.,1,1,1135814400B00003TL7PA19EF05WDNULJS
Her diapers are MUCH different then my 3 month old son though.,1,0,1135814400B00003TL7PA19EF05WDNULJS
So overall I love the Diaper Champ!,0,1,1135814400B00003TL7PA19EF05WDNULJS
I used my backpack like for 5 months and the seams by the zipper falling apart after like 40 uses.,1,1,1184198400B00029P388A38TI9JNGGW0YW
"It never happened to me ever in my entire life though I'm complete ""backpack person"" and I never had anything else but a backpack.",2,0,1184198400B00029P388A38TI9JNGGW0YW
Next time I will rather go than for a special backpack for normal backpack with all life warranty and buy changing pad for it.,1,0,1184198400B00029P388A38TI9JNGGW0YW
My daughter is a vigorous nurser and we supplement with expressed breast milk while I am at work.,2,0,1226707200B0010SD8VEA3KS9JXWUI3L6X
She cannot draw the milk in from these nipples and if she is hungry enough to do the extra work it takes about 40 minutes to eat 4 oz.,2,0,1226707200B0010SD8VEA3KS9JXWUI3L6X
Not worth it.,1,1,1226707200B0010SD8VEA3KS9JXWUI3L6X
At 2 months old our little guy was so fussy and we had tried 3 different formulas and almost every bottle.,2,0,1215648000B00078ANK2A2FK6QTW5MU07B
Finally we tried Dr. Brown's and literally overnight our cranky little man turned into a sweet baby who slept normally and cried only when hungry or tired or poopy.,0,1,1215648000B00078ANK2A2FK6QTW5MU07B
Before he cried all the time and we never knew why.,1,0,1215648000B00078ANK2A2FK6QTW5MU07B
and I thought we just had to wait it out until he was four months and they say fussy babies mellow.,2,0,1215648000B00078ANK2A2FK6QTW5MU07B
These bottles are not that hard to clean and worth the extra little effort it does take since it obviously helps with gas.,0,1,1215648000B00078ANK2A2FK6QTW5MU07B
The liquid flows so easily and the baby does not have to suck so hard- I highly recommend even if you don't have a fussy baby because they seem to work the way a bottle should.,0,1,1215648000B00078ANK2A2FK6QTW5MU07B
This sterilizer is so easy to use even a dad like me can use it.,0,1,995846400B000056OUHAQCHVXD1R9WYI
"The tray holds all types of bottles, caps, etc.",2,1,995846400B000056OUHAQCHVXD1R9WYI
"Best of all, the bottles are clean and sterilized in four minutes, without boiling water or running a half-full dishwasher.",0,1,995846400B000056OUHAQCHVXD1R9WYI
"I know, the price seems high, but this is one luxury that is truly a necessity.",0,1,995846400B000056OUHAQCHVXD1R9WYI
I received this set as a gift.,2,1,1111017600B00005UC6DA3HSQD4KEAC60O
"I do agree with one of the reviewers you get some of the items in the hospital, however, we didn't get all of the items and when you're a new parent pressed for time, it's awfully convenient to have everything you need packed into one kit.",2,0,1111017600B00005UC6DA3HSQD4KEAC60O
"The one ""add on"" that we put into the kit ourselves was a digital ear thermometer.",2,1,1111017600B00005UC6DA3HSQD4KEAC60O
"Other than that, it had everything we needed.",0,1,1111017600B00005UC6DA3HSQD4KEAC60O

"I also used it while in the hospital around my belly as an arm rest, since my tummy didn't work well as one any more.",1,0,1074902400B000067BIZA3POXMCWJD594
"When I got home I found laying her in it was perfect, kept her upright so I didn't have to worry about her choking on her milk after feeding, since she has acid reflux the doctor suggested keeping her upright for at least 5 minutes after feedings.",0,0,1074902400B000067BIZA3POXMCWJD594
"I have taken many good pictures of my little one as a baby, held her perfect.",0,1,1074902400B000067BIZA3POXMCWJD594
"Now that she is learning to sit up, its a perfect helper.",0,1,1074902400B000067BIZA3POXMCWJD594
I would definetly recomend this to any new parent!,0,1,1074902400B000067BIZA3POXMCWJD594
My baby doesn't like pacifiers at all so I was skeptical about this.,1,1,1195516800B000JWSO9IA3VD1P53RES7Z
"I was wrong, she loves it.",0,1,1195516800B000JWSO9IA3VD1P53RES7Z

For the most part I am very pleased with this product.,0,1,1137369600B00005BTNAA1XZJ29KK7O78S
It cut down on the gas problems my daughter had and really I had no trouble cleaning them.,0,1,1137369600B00005BTNAA1XZJ29KK7O78S
There was one bottle that for whatever reason leaked when I shook the bottle to mix it.,1,1,1137369600B00005BTNAA1XZJ29KK7O78S
"Seeing that it was only one bottle out of the 6 that we have, I am not too bothered by it.",1,1,1137369600B00005BTNAA1XZJ29KK7O78S

We have made liberal use of suction cup toys like this for our children.,2,0,1260835200B001H9NXLGA1N7FWCVYOSCZ6
We understand that you need to make sure that the surface is clean and smooth and that the suction cup is fully rinsed before trying to stick it down each time.,2,0,1260835200B001H9NXLGA1N7FWCVYOSCZ6
"Even with those precautions, sometimes they stay down; sometimes they don't.",1,1,1260835200B001H9NXLGA1N7FWCVYOSCZ6

inside.,2,0,1260835200B001H9NXLGA1N7FWCVYOSCZ6

I bought this diaper because of the good reviews however I found that it does nothing to keep out odors.,1,1,1262044800B00083HK0MA6A0OINXRSV6F

I used these for storing milk in the beginning.,2,1,1129593600B00018XCS8AZTY4WBRB5MAL
I never had a problem with them leaking.,0,1,1129593600B00018XCS8AZTY4WBRB5MAL
You really do need to screw the tops on correctly.,2,1,1129593600B00018XCS8AZTY4WBRB5MAL
The ablility to stack these is fantastic.,0,1,1129593600B00018XCS8AZTY4WBRB5MAL

"Yes, I have the usual collection of other brands of storage containers but I like the sturdiness of these.",0,1,1129593600B00018XCS8AZTY4WBRB5MAL
They don't dent in my diaper bag or purse.,0,1,1129593600B00018XCS8AZTY4WBRB5MAL
A great product that is easily re-purposed!,0,1,1129593600B00018XCS8AZTY4WBRB5MAL
I feel bad that some people have had such a poor experience with this lock.,1,1,1237939200B0000488W2A2D1KIELA53FAE
We on the other hand love these locks.,0,1,1237939200B0000488W2A2D1KIELA53FAE
We bought our first set 7 years ago to use with our first child.,2,1,1237939200B0000488W2A2D1KIELA53FAE
One set of Grandparents use them and an aunt too.,2,1,1237939200B0000488W2A2D1KIELA53FAE
I am just about to get a second set because we have a new crawler and I want to put them on the bathroom cabinets.,0,1,1237939200B0000488W2A2D1KIELA53FAE
They are a bit expensive but you will never need to buy locks again.,0,1,1237939200B0000488W2A2D1KIELA53FAE
We prefer to leave our on at all times (even when our children don't need the cabinets locked anymore) because they are easy to turn off (just a flip of the red tab inside the cabinet) that way they are there whenever you have little ones visiting your home.,0,1,1237939200B0000488W2A2D1KIELA53FAE
We have never split a cabinet and we don't think it takes that much longer to install then any other cabinet locks.,0,1,1237939200B0000488W2A2D1KIELA53FAE
You will have to drill in you cupboard doors but your little one(s) will be protected.,0,1,1237939200B0000488W2A2D1KIELA53FAE
It leaves no room for fingers to get pinched either.,1,1,1237939200B0000488W2A2D1KIELA53FAE
If you do happen to lose your lock you can buy a strong magnet from your home improvement store and still get it open.,1,1,1237939200B0000488W2A2D1KIELA53FAE
We like to keep our lock on the metal frame by the kitchen window above the sink.,2,1,1237939200B0000488W2A2D1KIELA53FAE
Good luck whatever you decide.,0,1,1237939200B0000488W2A2D1KIELA53FAE
I love this car seat.,0,1,1132963200B0001ZZQS0A1HBL1QZ1PK7JB
The fabric is nice.,0,1,1132963200B0001ZZQS0A1HBL1QZ1PK7JB
The straps easily adjust which matters right now because we are transitioning between seasons and sometimes my daughter has a jacket or sweater and sometimes not.,0,1,1132963200B0001ZZQS0A1HBL1QZ1PK7JB
It got the highest safety ratings everywhere I checked and of course that is the most important thing.,0,1,1132963200B0001ZZQS0A1HBL1QZ1PK7JB
It was also much easier to install than I thought.,0,1,1132963200B0001ZZQS0A1HBL1QZ1PK7JB
I had it installed at the fire station but had to take out.,1,1,1132963200B0001ZZQS0A1HBL1QZ1PK7JB
I decided to try myself instead of taking it back to the fire company and I was able to install it.,2,1,1132963200B0001ZZQS0A1HBL1QZ1PK7JB
I originally bought this as a way to make sure my baby stayed on her back or side while sleeping.,2,1,1086652800B00007B769A2UYLD3M1LV4VY
It works great for this!,0,1,1086652800B00007B769A2UYLD3M1LV4VY
"However, I found an even better use!",0,1,1086652800B00007B769A2UYLD3M1LV4VY
"My baby kicks the blankets off of her every night, even if I swaddle her, and I used to worry all night that she was uncovered and cold.",0,1,1086652800B00007B769A2UYLD3M1LV4VY
"So I take a receiving blanket and tuck it in all around her under the sleep positioner mat, so it makes it very hard for her to kick off the covers!",2,1,1086652800B00007B769A2UYLD3M1LV4VY
I think this is a must have for all new parents and babies!,0,1,1086652800B00007B769A2UYLD3M1LV4VY
This bathtub is great!,0,1,1095120000B000067EH7A28KF3SKY3H2TQ

"The tub fits perfectly in my kitchen sink, and has a little compartment to hold soap etc.",0,1,1095120000B000067EH7A28KF3SKY3H2TQ
Edited to say: At almost 8 months we are still using this bathtub!,2,1,1095120000B000067EH7A28KF3SKY3H2TQ
"We moved it from the sink into the tub quite a while ago, and took the mesh cradle out.",2,1,1095120000B000067EH7A28KF3SKY3H2TQ
"He is almost too big for it now, and we'll be looking at those bath seats.",2,1,1095120000B000067EH7A28KF3SKY3H2TQ
"However, there are not that many baby items that you can say you got almost 8 months use from - so I'm very satisfied.",0,1,1095120000B000067EH7A28KF3SKY3H2TQ
Great purchase - highly recommended!,0,1,1095120000B000067EH7A28KF3SKY3H2TQ
Our daughter has used this tub since her first day home at 4 pounds and the tub has made bathing her very easy even that small!,0,1,1167264000B0009UBSFMAKDI0L19GA8DL
"Now that she is bigger, (5 months old, 11 pounds) she still uses the sling and we love that the pillow moves up to cushion her head and the plastic divider below supports her tushie.",0,1,1167264000B0009UBSFMAKDI0L19GA8DL
I suggest always drying out the tub/sling after each bath by squeezing out excess water from the pillow and turning tub over to air dry.,2,1,1167264000B0009UBSFMAKDI0L19GA8DL
We have never had any problem with mildew (like some users) because we always dry out the tub between baths.,0,1,1167264000B0009UBSFMAKDI0L19GA8DL
I waited a really long time to buy this because it felt like a lot of money to pay for a smock.,1,1,1202428800B000CSBP9KA2G6OS10YOK4IH
I regret waiting at all.,2,1,1202428800B000CSBP9KA2G6OS10YOK4IH
It makes feeding time infinitely easier- I don't have to completely strip down my toddler anymore or spend hours trying to clean out stains.,0,1,1202428800B000CSBP9KA2G6OS10YOK4IH
"It's long enough to cover his lap beyond the highchair tray (if you don't use a tray, part of the legs will still be exposed for spills).",0,1,1202428800B000CSBP9KA2G6OS10YOK4IH
The neck is high enough to cover his collar which used to get hit even with a bib.,2,1,1202428800B000CSBP9KA2G6OS10YOK4IH
"It's really easy to clean, and I'm no longer afraid to let my child feed himself goopy, staining foods!",0,1,1202428800B000CSBP9KA2G6OS10YOK4IH
It's completely worth it and I wish I'd had it since he started solids.,0,1,1202428800B000CSBP9KA2G6OS10YOK4IH
Later edit: We've now had this smock for about 2 years and it's barely showing signs of wear.,0,1,1202428800B000CSBP9KA2G6OS10YOK4IH
I throw it in the laundry about once a week for a thorough cleaning and just wipe it down with a paper towel between meals.,2,1,1202428800B000CSBP9KA2G6OS10YOK4IH
The best way to get it clean is to turn it inside out in the wash and then hang it over a chair.,2,1,1202428800B000CSBP9KA2G6OS10YOK4IH
It will dry extremely fast and get really clean.,0,1,1202428800B000CSBP9KA2G6OS10YOK4IH
"If you don't turn it inside out, the sleeves have a hard time drying on the inside where the absorbent fabric is.",1,1,1202428800B000CSBP9KA2G6OS10YOK4IH
We LOVE this smock and just ordered a second one for my daughter.,0,1,1202428800B000CSBP9KA2G6OS10YOK4IH
I used these bottles and had no problems whatsoever.,0,1,1144108800B00006966IA1ZPFA3QQFBBX6
They helped with gas yet were not a pain to clean (like the Dr. Brown's bottles.,1,0,1144108800B00006966IA1ZPFA3QQFBBX6
oh my gosh.,1,0,1144108800B00006966IA1ZPFA3QQFBBX6
talk about time consuming).,1,0,1144108800B00006966IA1ZPFA3QQFBBX6
Others mentioned leaking around the bottom of the bottle; I had a bottle leak one time but soon realized I did not have the plastic disc in place completely.,1,1,1144108800B00006966IA1ZPFA3QQFBBX6

The picture and sound quality is decent on this camera.,0,1,1258848000B001FB567UA1IOIKTR8WIEUP
The main problem I have is the battery life.,1,1,1258848000B001FB567UA1IOIKTR8WIEUP
It is definitely not enough to last through the whole night.,1,1,1258848000B001FB567UA1IOIKTR8WIEUP
The camera unit has to be hooked up to the AC adapter most of the day and the monitor has to get recharged every 4 hours.,2,1,1258848000B001FB567UA1IOIKTR8WIEUP
In order to get the monitor fully charged you have to let it charge for 3 hours.,2,1,1258848000B001FB567UA1IOIKTR8WIEUP
I would not recommend this monitor to anyone.,1,1,1258848000B001FB567UA1IOIKTR8WIEUP
Try to look for a monitor with a longer battery life.,1,1,1258848000B001FB567UA1IOIKTR8WIEUP
This swing is well designed in every way.,0,1,1224547200B000NUJM0GA234HXDATOAYEY
"The seat is soft and baby-shaped, the different speeds are great, the music is not annoying at all, the toy bar is cute, the fabric is cozy and attractive, the fold-up legs are so helpful, the small size stays out of the way, the recline is perfect for newborns and sleeping babies, and the battery life is great.",0,1,1224547200B000NUJM0GA234HXDATOAYEY
"I liked the idea of taking it from room to room like others have said, but I'm finding that in reality, with a baby in one arm, I just can't.",0,1,1224547200B000NUJM0GA234HXDATOAYEY
"It's a little bit awkward to carry one-handed, and the legs, when open, are too wide to fit through the doorways of my 1850's apartment so I'd need to put the baby down to fold it-- too many steps!",1,1,1224547200B000NUJM0GA234HXDATOAYEY

"I just received this item as a baby shower gift, so my review is somewhate limited since I haven't actually used it yet!",2,1,1108425600B0002ZOI9WA24ZVNHFYQPLAL
"Nonetheless, a few things I noted.",1,1,1108425600B0002ZOI9WA24ZVNHFYQPLAL
"First, the way in which the hanging toys are attached to the activity bar is different than what is pictured.",1,1,1108425600B0002ZOI9WA24ZVNHFYQPLAL
"They do not go through loops that hang down from the bar, but rather velcro onto it.",1,1,1108425600B0002ZOI9WA24ZVNHFYQPLAL
"That's fine, except the velcro is backwards, in my opinion, for the cow.",1,1,1108425600B0002ZOI9WA24ZVNHFYQPLAL
"Or, the cow needs to have a face on both sides!",1,1,1108425600B0002ZOI9WA24ZVNHFYQPLAL
"The way it attaches, the baby looks at the back of it's blank white head!",2,1,1108425600B0002ZOI9WA24ZVNHFYQPLAL
"The cow should be for the baby, not the parents to look at!",1,1,1108425600B0002ZOI9WA24ZVNHFYQPLAL
"Also, the vibration is really, really loud -- at least without a baby sitting in the seat.",1,1,1108425600B0002ZOI9WA24ZVNHFYQPLAL
"I assume the baby's body muffles the sound, since no one else noted this in their review.",1,1,1108425600B0002ZOI9WA24ZVNHFYQPLAL
"On the positive side, it was simple to assemble and you can use it up to 40 lbs!",0,1,1108425600B0002ZOI9WA24ZVNHFYQPLAL
We just set up our son's nursery and tested out the Sony monitor.,2,1,1121990400B000S35QLCA1XTRCXQYYHMMM

"He could hear me everywhere he went, both upstairs and down.",2,0,1121990400B000S35QLCA1XTRCXQYYHMMM

But it is GREAT!,0,1,1139011200B000067EH7A2PGJ6XD5T5300
I don't know what I would've done without it because it comes with a net to place newborns in.,0,1,1139011200B000067EH7A2PGJ6XD5T5300

that's both me and my daughter,2,1,1122595200B00006G963A2HHX876PGDZL
I had been using the Take and Toss ones in the sippy cups and saw these with the straws.,2,1,1218067200B0000BX8LVALNFHVS3SC4FV
It's one step closer to moving my son to using regular cups.,2,1,1218067200B0000BX8LVALNFHVS3SC4FV
He feels like a big boy using a cup and straw instead of a sippy cup like his baby brother.,0,1,1218067200B0000BX8LVALNFHVS3SC4FV
They last with repeated use for several months then ours eventually develop a crack in them from being thrown on the floor.,1,1,1218067200B0000BX8LVALNFHVS3SC4FV
I do hand wash mine even though they state top-rack dishwasher safe and I believe that helps them last a little longer.,1,1,1218067200B0000BX8LVALNFHVS3SC4FV
My sons are at the age where we are transitioning them from sippy cups to regular cups and these are perfect for that in-between stage.,0,1,1218067200B0000BX8LVALNFHVS3SC4FV
These are also labeled plastic type 5 which is polypropylene which is considered safe and does not leach BPA (bisphenol-A) into foods and beverages like some plastics can.,2,1,1218067200B0000BX8LVALNFHVS3SC4FV
That makes me feel better and sets my mind at ease about using these with my children.,0,1,1218067200B0000BX8LVALNFHVS3SC4FV
Make sure that you put the lid on the cup and then insert the straw.,1,1,1218067200B0000BX8LVALNFHVS3SC4FV
"If you are refilling and take the top off with the straw still in and then replace, liquid will come shooting out the straw.",1,1,1218067200B0000BX8LVALNFHVS3SC4FV
I have loved this pump.,0,1,1256169600B0028MI4M4A2MQ7X9MMX3XQZ
I have used it since I got home from the hospital and my daughter is now 10 weeks old.,0,1,1256169600B0028MI4M4A2MQ7X9MMX3XQZ
The only other pump I have experience with is the Medela Symphony in the hospital.,2,0,1256169600B0028MI4M4A2MQ7X9MMX3XQZ
I found the 3 minute letdown feature annoying on it.,1,1,1256169600B0028MI4M4A2MQ7X9MMX3XQZ
The Hygeia Enjoye jumps right in just like the baby and works well.,0,1,1256169600B0028MI4M4A2MQ7X9MMX3XQZ

"I understand the reason for the baby recording button, however, I find it silly and annoying since I seem to hit it by accident.",1,1,1256169600B0028MI4M4A2MQ7X9MMX3XQZ
I have not had issues with pumping so it may be useful if you do.,0,1,1256169600B0028MI4M4A2MQ7X9MMX3XQZ
I would recommend this pump to anyone and love that it is more green and can safely be reused by others.,0,1,1256169600B0028MI4M4A2MQ7X9MMX3XQZ
Nothing has broke or worn out.,0,1,1256169600B0028MI4M4A2MQ7X9MMX3XQZ

These bottles are a true must have!,0,1,1201651200B0000936M4A2LYF3DJN9X5JN
They are the only worthwhile bottles on the market and are well worth the extra price as well as the extra time to wash.,0,1,1201651200B0000936M4A2LYF3DJN9X5JN
"They really limit the gas intake and we never had an issue with leaking bottles, like so many other brands.",0,1,1201651200B0000936M4A2LYF3DJN9X5JN
It is a bit of a hassle to get all the pieces in the dishwasher.,1,1,1201651200B0000936M4A2LYF3DJN9X5JN
"I like the wide neck bottles because they are closer to breast feeding and when my son got older, it was easier for him to hold the bottle on his own.",0,1,1201651200B0000936M4A2LYF3DJN9X5JN

When my baby was younger and I couldn't get him to go to sleep I would put him in this bouncer with the vibration on & it would put him right to sleep.,0,1,1136073600B000324Y7UA36PZ6EUGTJN2O
Now that he is 4 months old he wont sleep in it and wont stay in it very long.,2,1,1136073600B000324Y7UA36PZ6EUGTJN2O

Put this one on first and then the other one on over top.,2,1,1220832000B000G0J5FUA3DPG6BP8DDO1V
I leave the legs out because it's the arms that cause the waking.,2,1,1220832000B000G0J5FUA3DPG6BP8DDO1V
Ths reason I give this blanket 4 stars is because it doesn't work without the other swaddle blanket on top.,2,1,1220832000B000G0J5FUA3DPG6BP8DDO1V

I dropped one of my caps on the ground and snapped the part off that the tube goes over.,2,1,1255564800B000GE9ZFQAU7TML120DSKT
