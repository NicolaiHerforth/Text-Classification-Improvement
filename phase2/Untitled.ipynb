       "\"I had a Safety 1st potty that I just hated before I bought this Baby Bjorn potty.  It leaked, its round opening was WAY too small, and I had a ton of problems with my son leaking all over the front and on to the floor.  Plus it came apart in many pieces and had lots of spots bacteria could hide.  The Baby Bjorn takes care of all the problems I had with the Safety 1st potty!The simple construction is so sanitary and easy to clean.  There are no little places for bacteria to collect.The opening is bigger than other potty chairs and oblong instead of round, so no more pooping on the seat.  This alone would have sold me on this potty.The splash guard is great for boys.  No more peeing off the front of the potty and no flimsy detachable splash guards that flip down into the seat.It has a nice rubber grip on the bottom to keep it in the same place on the floor.Another plus is that it's nice looking and blends in with the rest of the bathroom.I'm very happy with the quality and design of this potty and I have NO complaints!\""

The covers and pillows are washable although I haven't washed the pillow yet i have washed the covers several times and they are holding up great.
