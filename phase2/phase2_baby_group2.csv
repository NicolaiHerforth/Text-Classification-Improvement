261,positive,"Great potty, especially for boys!","I had a Safety 1st potty that I just hated before I bought this Baby Bjorn potty.  It leaked, its round opening was WAY too small, and I had a ton of problems with my son leaking all over the front and on to the floor.  Plus it came apart in many pieces and had lots of spots bacteria could hide.  The Baby Bjorn takes care of all the problems I had with the Safety 1st potty!The simple construction is so sanitary and easy to clean.  There are no little places for bacteria to collect.The opening is bigger than other potty chairs and oblong instead of round, so no more pooping on the seat.  This alone would have sold me on this potty.The splash guard is great for boys.  No more peeing off the front of the potty and no flimsy detachable splash guards that flip down into the seat.It has a nice rubber grip on the bottom to keep it in the same place on the floor.Another plus is that it's nice looking and blends in with the rest of the bathroom.I'm very happy with the quality and design of this potty and I have NO complaints!",2005,1122422400B000056J7KA3GJ0RDALQQT5G,B000056J7K,A3GJ0RDALQQT5G
262,positive,safe and nice looking,"I love this co-sleeper because I have a one-bedroom apartment and I prefer bedsharing to a crib.  The co-sleeper is great for my daughter to sleep or rest in.  She's always close by because I can wheel it around the apartment.  and it has tons of storage, which is also a huge help.  It's extremely portable and fits into a small bag.  It's easy to assemble and take apart.  And it has excellent safety features.  I'm going to keep this stored in the closet to use with any more new babies we have.",2009,1253318400B000HKY1GMA1YHI49AWYNI34,B000HKY1GM,A1YHI49AWYNI34
263,positive,You have to have this,I wish i would have brought this to the hospital with me when i was struggling to the point of tears with nursing. Now at 11 weeks old I use the Boppy to nurse everyday and night. I use it so much I had to buy a second one to use upstairs in the middle of the night. The covers and pillows are washable although I haven't washed the pillow yet i have washed the covers several times and they are holding up great. I use this to nurse and to play because it is great to put the boppy by my knees and then the baby can see my face and it is easy to get her to smile using the boppy for support.,2005,1122595200B000231GEOA2D6B8N0CTJ28L,B000231GEO,A2D6B8N0CTJ28L
264,positive,It was fun while it lasted,"We got this water mat when my twins were very small - 3 months maybe?  We would prop them up in bobby pillows and put the mat in between them and they liked leaning over to feel the mat.  The ""fish"" (toys) inside did not move as much as I thought - maybe we didn't have it filled up right?Then, once they were sitting up on their own, we would sit them on the mat...we said they were sitting in their pool..and they enjoyed that.  Eventually, one of them punctured it and we didn't try to put a patch on it.We use the floating toys in the bath tub now ;)",2009,1245801600B000E82WRMA2QANOGP5LLPBQ,B000E82WRM,A2QANOGP5LLPBQ
265,positive,Good Price but..............,"I bought this as 2nd stroller, to park and short errand for my 4 months baby.Cons:Light weightGood canopy size5 point harnessRecline (thoug not alot but is comfortable for my 4 months old)Durable madeEasily clean seat fabricDoes not tip over when my diaper bag and shopping bags hand over the handle!ProsSmall and uselss basket.. impossible to put anything in it or accesswish it will recline moreLonger handle ( I am 5 2 and on off i kick the back of the wheels.

266,positive,Excellent!,"We bought this primarily because it had better reviews than the Diaper Genie when we bought it and that we don't have to buy special bags. I love that you can use trash bags. I haven't had a problem with the bag not being full enough. For one, when the Champ is full the trash bag is a bit more then half full, but is also very heavy so you wouldn't want anymore diapers in there anyway. The only problem I've found with it was when my sister-in-law put my 2 year old nieces diaper in there and the smell lingered a bit. Her diapers are MUCH different then my 3 month old son though. So overall I love the Diaper Champ!",2005,1135814400B00003TL7PA19EF05WDNULJS,B00003TL7P,A19EF05WDNULJS
267,negative,Love the features but this bag is not good at all,"I used my backpack like for 5 months and the seams by the zipper falling apart after like 40 uses. It never happened to me ever in my entire life though I'm complete ""backpack person"" and I never had anything else but a backpack.. Next time I will rather go than for a special backpack for normal backpack with all life warranty and buy changing pad for it.",2007,1184198400B00029P388A38TI9JNGGW0YW,B00029P388,A38TI9JNGGW0YW
268,negative,Way too slow for even a (full term) breastfed baby,My daughter is a vigorous nurser and we supplement with expressed breast milk while I am at work.  She cannot draw the milk in from these nipples and if she is hungry enough to do the extra work it takes about 40 minutes to eat 4 oz. Not worth it.,2008,1226707200B0010SD8VEA3KS9JXWUI3L6X,B0010SD8VE,A3KS9JXWUI3L6X
269,positive,Sanity saver for us,At 2 months old our little guy was so fussy and we had tried 3 different formulas and almost every bottle. Finally we tried Dr. Brown's and literally overnight our cranky little man turned into a sweet baby who slept normally and cried only when hungry or tired or poopy. Before he cried all the time and we never knew why...and I thought we just had to wait it out until he was four months and they say fussy babies mellow.These bottles are not that hard to clean and worth the extra little effort it does take since it obviously helps with gas. The liquid flows so easily and the baby does not have to suck so hard- I highly recommend even if you don't have a fussy baby because they seem to work the way a bottle should.,2008,1215648000B00078ANK2A2FK6QTW5MU07B,B00078ANK2,A2FK6QTW5MU07B
270,positive,Best thing since sliced bread,"This sterilizer is so easy to use even a dad like me can use it.  The tray holds all types of bottles, caps, etc.  Best of all, the bottles are clean and sterilized in four minutes, without boiling water or running a half-full dishwasher.I know, the price seems high, but this is one luxury that is truly a necessity.",2001,995846400B000056OUHAQCHVXD1R9WYI,B000056OUH,AQCHVXD1R9WYI
271,positive,Terrific set,"I received this set as a gift.  I do agree with one of the reviewers you get some of the items in the hospital, however, we didn't get all of the items and when you're a new parent pressed for time, it's awfully convenient to have everything you need packed into one kit.The one ""add on"" that we put into the kit ourselves was a digital ear thermometer.  Other than that, it had everything we needed.It's great for travel, and the items are well made and attractive in appearance.  It would make a terrific gift.",2005,1111017600B00005UC6DA3HSQD4KEAC60O,B00005UC6D,A3HSQD4KEAC60O
272,positive,PERFECT FOR ANY NEW MOM!,"I LOVE my Boppy!  Everyone asked me, what's a Boppy. I figured it was just for feeding. Boy was I wrong. I breast feed my daughter, so I used it right away in the hospital. I also used it while in the hospital around my belly as an arm rest, since my tummy didn't work well as one any more. When I got home I found laying her in it was perfect, kept her upright so I didn't have to worry about her choking on her milk after feeding, since she has acid reflux the doctor suggested keeping her upright for at least 5 minutes after feedings... I have taken many good pictures of my little one as a baby, held her perfect. Now that she is learning to sit up, its a perfect helper.. I would definetly recomend this to any new parent!",2004,1074902400B000067BIZA3POXMCWJD594,B000067BIZ,A3POXMCWJD594
273,positive,So much better than a pacifier,"My baby doesn't like pacifiers at all so I was skeptical about this. I was wrong, she loves it. It really helps her with teething because she loves to chew on it. Highly recommend it.",2007,1195516800B000JWSO9IA3VD1P53RES7Z,B000JWSO9I,A3VD1P53RES7Z
274,positive,fits well,Haven't had any accidents to report on the function.  The fit is great and texture is great too.,2009,1256688000B001FCK32CA1F0809QT61J2D,B001FCK32C,A1F0809QT61J2D
275,positive,Generally a really good product,"For the most part I am very pleased with this product. It cut down on the gas problems my daughter had and really I had no trouble cleaning them. There was one bottle that for whatever reason leaked when I shook the bottle to mix it. Seeing that it was only one bottle out of the 6 that we have, I am not too bothered by it. Ultimately it's a fine product and I would recommend it.",2006,1137369600B00005BTNAA1XZJ29KK7O78S,B00005BTNA,A1XZJ29KK7O78S
276,positive,Soft sheets!,"These sheets are so soft, made of jersey fabric.  They are a little big for my cosco play yard, but they're overall good, especially for the price!",2007,1194480000B00030AZT8A1C4J5MRES1KRK,B00030AZT8,A1C4J5MRES1KRK
277,positive,A good buy,"No special bags to buy... change at least twice per week (especially in the summer) and you are good to go. Remember this thing contains poop, so if it is not changed often, it will smell.",2005,1122508800B00003TL7PA2HHX876PGDZL,B00003TL7P,A2HHX876PGDZL
278,negative,"Good, but battery makes it hard to wash","We have made liberal use of suction cup toys like this for our children. We understand that you need to make sure that the surface is clean and smooth and that the suction cup is fully rinsed before trying to stick it down each time. Even with those precautions, sometimes they stay down; sometimes they don't.I bought this toy because we had something similar that I bought 8 years ago for my first child. I really didn't want something with a light in it, but didn't have a choice. My 6 month old will put this in his mouth while he sits at the table with us and it generally gets covered with food or drool. He couldn't care less about the light, which is motion activated.There is a little hole in the light-up ball that allows water (and who knows what else?) inside. Washing it means having to keep your finger over the hole and hope that you can rinse it fast enough. If food gets inside that hole, you are out of luck.I can't figure out why anyone would make a suction cup toy (presumably for use at a high chair, around food) that cannot be easily washed.",2009,1260835200B001H9NXLGA1N7FWCVYOSCZ6,B001H9NXLG,A1N7FWCVYOSCZ6
279,positive,4days old,my 4 day old son loved this swing he slept in it for hours it was the best $165.00 i ever spent for my lil one and for my sanity.,2009,1251331200B000I5Q19QA3JZAPUZEV61TN,B000I5Q19Q,A3JZAPUZEV61TN
280,positive,Perfect size for travel snacks!,I love the size of these bowls!  They are great to put snacks in and toss in the diaper bag.  They are quality plastic and last a long time.  I am buying more because over time you loose a few here and a few there.  Great to have on hand if you have toddlers.,2008,1201564800B000JVXUF2ARS7MNRW8YNNH,B000JVXUF2,ARS7MNRW8YNNH
281,negative,Does nothing for odors,I bought this diaper because of the good reviews however I found that it does nothing to keep out odors.  I am going to purchase the odor disks I just saw on amazon.  Hopefully this will help.  My son's room is very small and once I open the diaper pail his whole room begins to smell and its not like the pail is filled with dirty diapers when this occurs.  I would only have 2-3 diapers in there when it begins to smell.  I wish I had gone with a more expensive diaper pail because I can't take the odor.  I hope this helps.,2009,1262044800B00083HK0MA6A0OINXRSV6F,B00083HK0M,A6A0OINXRSV6F
282,positive,Best bath tub!,Our son loves this bath tub! He is so relaxed in it! Best out there on the market!,2005,1130198400B000056OV0A12D7ROCUOZVP8,B000056OV0,A12D7ROCUOZVP8
283,positive,Great for a girl!,"I have a little girl and she started using this potty chair at a year old (early, but just to get the concept!)... she has loved it since day one!  She was entertained by the music which was a great incentive for her to stay a little longer on the potty, and when she was ready it transfers and snaps onto the &quot;big girl potty&quot; and still plays music!  She is now two and uses just the big potty but every now and then she still asks for this!  We didn't get much use out of the potty book that comes with it, but it's a cute idea.  All in all this was a good choice for us!",2004,1073865600B000067QMJAP2DUPMGNQP9T,B000067QMJ,AP2DUPMGNQP9T
284,positive,love it,"I bought this for my three month old son and we are really pleased with it. It's fun for him to learn to sit up and it offers a new vantage point for him. The toy is also very entertaining.I did not have a problem with the smell like others- there was a slight smell when I opened the item, but after washing it and airing out over night, I really didn't notice an odor.I would really recommend this to other parents.",2009,1249257600B00162ZLVEA20WZCDGVPLE7X,B00162ZLVE,A20WZCDGVPLE7X
285,positive,Best bath tub for infants and toddlers,"Our baby's umbilical cord stump fell of when she was just a few days old, so we bathed her in this tub.  She was too tiny for her arms to fit in the arm places, but it worked perfectly because she fit snugly and securely in the place that the body is supposed to go.  Baby won't slip under the water because of the plastic mouldings, so you can have both hands free to wash and reach. Once our baby was big enough to sit up, we put her on the other end (toddler end), and she plays and splashes, while still having the plastic molding so she can't slip back into the water.  She's 18 months old now and we fill the tub to the brim in the big bathtub.  This is a large baby tub, but it stores easily in the bathtub, cleans up very easily, and you will be able to use it for 2 years at least!  Well worth the extra $$.",2004,1086220800B000056OV0A2FH9IFBOQTFNP,B000056OV0,A2FH9IFBOQTFNP
286,positive,Awesome!,"My baby was breast fed for the first 2 months. We used a nipple shield by Medela but as she got older the nipple shield was just not cutting it when it came to my baby being full. I decided to pump but when my baby was fussy I couldn't pump every 3-4 hours like I needed to so my supply dropped. I didn't buy this starter set, I bought a few 4 ounce bottles and gave my baby what milk I had pumped and formula. I have now bought the 8 ounce bottles and use them also. These bottles are great. My baby burps right away and is never gassy. With breast feeding she hardly ever burped. We use the drop in liners and have had NO problems with leaks. I also heat her formula up by putting hot water in a cup, putting the formula in a liner and dropping the liner into the warm water. Then I mixed it up with a spoon to make sure there are no cold spots, test it and put the liner into the bottle and feed my baby. You also don't have to worry about water dripping off the liner and getting on baby because of the plastic they are made of, the water does not stick to the liner. When I pull the liner out you can't even tell it has been sitting in water.(...)",2005,1108080000B00008614FA1CGOXRZ1A9PCY,B00008614F,A1CGOXRZ1A9PCY
287,positive,So convenient!,"I originally bought the Munchkin formula dispenser to use while we were out and about. Since then I have found that I even like to use it at home also. It's so convenient to be able to pour the pre-measured amount of formula into my sons bottle. So simple. I also have a formula dispenser that I got at WalMart (Parent's Choice brand), and that one works well also, but doesn't hold the full 8 oz. worth of formula that this one does. The Munchkin formula dispenser was a great buy for sure!",2008,1202083200B0009ET94AA1C80KO0L5I0IZ,B0009ET94A,A1C80KO0L5I0IZ
288,negative,Doesn't mix Nutramigen very well.,"The concept of this pitcher is to keep the mixing blades below the surface of the liquid to keep air to a minimum.  Unfortunately, lots of formulas float and need a lot of agitation to mix properly.  For these formulas, this pitcher is useless.Additionally, the lid goes on secure but is not liquid tight.  Tip it or shake it and you'll have a mess.One last item - in order to adjust the height of the mixing blade you have to take the lid off and push a rubber grommet up/down the shaft.  This isn't easy and of course it's wet with formula.  This seems like a messy or unsanitary way to have to do every time you make and pour a bottle.Instead we found a liquid tight pitcher.  Shake the heck out of it to mix, then a few hours later the bubbles have settled.  If you can plan more than a bottle ahead, this might work out better for you, too.",2008,1203897600B0010L98DIA3EK2KTYHJCPB9,B0010L98DI,A3EK2KTYHJCPB9
289,positive,Cute and Useful!,This cute storage provides a useful place to store all the baby materials from the hospital and doctor's visit.  Lots of extra folders for additional items.,2008,1226188800B001F8TLLUA3752DDGZ3COTF,B001F8TLLU,A3752DDGZ3COTF
290,negative,Look at the back straps! BUY SYNERGY WITH BACK SUPPORT!,"Don't you think those back straps will pull your shoulders forward? YES they will. My back started to hurt after 5 minutes walking with my 9 lbs baby! I give not 1 but 2 stars because it is a good quality, strong, VERY easy to use baby carrier, BUT invest more money in it and buyBabyBj&ouml;rn Baby Carrier Synergy - BlackIt has that magic back support! P.S> You have to adjust the straps as your baby grows then nothing will press against her diaper area or anywhere else.",2009,1236038400B0009JOSNWACRLYXWTJW9GP,B0009JOSNW,ACRLYXWTJW9GP
291,positive,Very Comfortable,This Boppy is very comfortable.  I like the asymmetrical design; it allows me to tuck the larger part between my legs while the smaller part is wedged under my belly for extra support.  I had been having hip pain while sleeping at night and this little jobby did the trick.  The only negative comment I have on this is that it does tend to make me a little warm while sleeping but I think anything would.  All in all this was a great purchase and I would suggest it to anyone trying to adjust to sleeping on their side (I am typically a stomach sleeper) or to anyone experiencing hip pain.UPDATE:  I have now had my baby and have used this pillow to help prop him up during feedings!!!  I have gotten my money's worth out of this Boppy; I use it every day still.,2005,1128988800B00063EDEKA1ZPFA3QQFBBX6,B00063EDEK,A1ZPFA3QQFBBX6
292,positive,Love this!,"No complaints!  Love this carrier.  Only complain, baby outgrew it.  We did get a lot of use out of it though before that.",2004,1099180800B000059XODA2T8KEA8791MQ0,B000059XOD,A2T8KEA8791MQ0
293,positive,2 Month Old Loves It!!!,My daughter loves this gym!  She laughs out loud at the musical star!  All of our videos of her are on this mat.  I like it because everything is detchable and I sometimes take the birdies and attach them to her car seat.  She just loves all of the goodies associated with the mat.  I would say that this item is definately worth the money!,2005,1105315200B0000936LRA2611L97GGZH5,B0000936LR,A2611L97GGZH5
294,positive,Great for messy kids,"My daughter is 20 months old and loves to do it ALL herself...this bib is a lifesaver, and an outfit saver.  The pocket is perfectly placed and the shoulders are wide enough to protect her sleeves.  If only I'd bought this a year ago...",2007,1186358400B000GJF5D2A2B54P9ZDYH167,B000GJF5D2,A2B54P9ZDYH167
295,positive,No Gas Problems,"My son is one big ball of gas. We loved the Advent bottles but they didn't help with his gas problem. These bottles are great for babies who don't need any more air in their tummys. Also the nipples are great for babies that used to the breast, or babies that are between the breast and bottle.The newborn gift set gets you going with all the bottles you will need to start things out plus some for when baby starts getting older.No air in belly, price is not over the top, nipples are the best I have found, and very well made (no leaks at all)",2006,1139011200B00006966IAEK5GOE7UFP2P,B00006966I,AEK5GOE7UFP2P
296,positive,All in One Essentials,This is definitely the set to get. It includes everything you'll need for baby well care in a convenient storage pouch. I tend to leave things all over my house but with this kit I never have to search for tiny items. All of the pieces I've tried so far work very well also. The clippers are my favorite since they are very easy to handle. The scissors work for nails as well. The brush is excellent....very soft bristles for my daughter who doesn't have much hair yet. Nail files and alcohol swabs are nice extras. The bulb syringe works better than the one from  Gerber that I have and the thermometer was a cinch to use as well. I have yet to use the medicine dropper or water temp taker but I doubt there is anything wrong with those items. I also have to wait for my daughter's teeth before I test the toothbrush but it's nice that I have everything handy already. I love this set and keep it clipped on my nursery cart. It also comes with a useful book on taking care of your baby. Definitely the best kit with the most baby essentials.,2002,1036886400B00005UC6DA307YFSORUAXSQ,B00005UC6D,A307YFSORUAXSQ
297,negative,Don't waste time and money on this stroller!,"I bought this stroller when our son was 1 month old and used it not even for 5 months and also occasionally. I found this stroller to be a piece of junk!! The back bends like a letter C and our son who is not even 6 months yet was so uncomfortable that I had to buy another stroller ""Peg Perego Aria"" and am so glad I did because it is much lighter than chicco and much sturdier. Peg Perego also has a bigger basket. In the end, I returned the Chicco, the customer service at BabiesRUs was so great that they gave us a store credit. Beware!!! The chicco stroller at the beginning seems to be great but after a while as the child gets older and heavier, the flimsy back bends!!! Don't waste your time and money on this stroller!!!",2006,1139529600B0009DPILEA12D7ROCUOZVP8,B0009DPILE,A12D7ROCUOZVP8

299,positive,nice lil unit,this is a good pump. it just has a bit of a learning curve. i can successfully pump 2-4oz in 10-15 min with this pump. it's also quite quiet.highly recommended.,2009,1256601600B001FSHJFUA3DEISWZD80JCK,B001FSHJFU,A3DEISWZD80JCK
300,positive,Get the colored ones,I've tried a few different brands of pacifiers and these were hands down the best. I tried the NUK type and they kept flying out of my baby's mouth. She has done well with these since birth (she is now 9 months). She had some of the clear pacifiers and they were so hard to find if they fell or got misplaced. Try the colored ones. I highly recommend them!,2008,1205798400B000EGZ2SAA36N62I47U9IIH,B000EGZ2SA,A36N62I47U9IIH
301,positive,BEST PUMP EVER!!!,"I used an avent pump with my first and let me tell you how great this pump is. All you do is attach the liner to the breast pump, fill it up, and cap it and you can store it or feed right then. It is so comfortable. You have 5 settings to choose from for the speed and suction. It comes with bags for everything. The carrying case, case for traveling with milk and bottles, and case for the parts. LOVE IT!! It cannot get any easier than this. I pump 4 ounces in less than 3 minutes. Try this and you will love it",2006,1146355200B0000TYHD2A38DSZM1N0WDQ0,B0000TYHD2,A38DSZM1N0WDQ0
302,positive,love it!!,This is the best thing ever. My daughter was in a booster seat before we got this but she wanted to feel like a big girl and sit at the table. Just pushing her booster up to the table wasn't good enough. The kaboost did the job. It's very sturdy and easy to put on the chairs. plus you can take it to restaurants without it being a pain. I highly recommend it to everyone with a toddler.,2008,1220832000B000V3YFJIA36BTPMVB6B84K,B000V3YFJI,A36BTPMVB6B84K
303,positive,Great safe place to play,"I got this with the extension.  It's been great for my twins.  There is lots of room for them to play with each other.  It also offers me a safe place to put them if I need to do something quick like pour a bottle.  It did take some maneuvering to set up because it is large and awkward when you unfold it.  It also sounds like you're breaking it because it has ""teeth"" on each hinge that pop into place in small increments (each increment makes a clicking sound).  We don't bother to open or close the gate to get in and out, we just step over it.

All my joints were loosened up and my hip and shoulder pain is gone!!  I'm 5'7"" and about 5 months preggo.  I'm an average size and this fits me perfectly!The only thing I would change is the cover.  It's a poly/cotton blend and it's rough and itchy.

311,positive,A pretty good pump,"I received this pump as a gift.  I like it because it is electric.  I got the manual attachment free from the hospital and it is very difficult to use even with the spring loading.  For manual use I recommend the Avent Isis.  However, there are times when I just feel like sitting down and not having to manually pump.  This works great.  It comes with storage containers and a nipple insert for smaller nipples.  Plus it comes with some lanolin just incase you get sore nipples.  It is a pretty good buy.  It doesn't work any better than a manual, but it is more convenient since you don't have to work as hard.  I wouldn't have bought it myself, but since it was given to me, I am glad to have it.  :)",2002,1019520000B000056HMVA2A4T3NHN1P5ZS,B000056HMV,A2A4T3NHN1P5ZS

314,positive,"Be Practical, Not Trendy!","Diaper Champ vs. Diaper Genie...Diaper Champ wins by 1 reason alone - they DO NOT REQUIRE you to buy their bags. Any trash bag will do. We bought a box of 500 trash bags for ten dollars; Diaper Gennie will only work with Diaper Genie Bags which are expensive.Besides that, I chose this one because as we were doing our registry, a FATHER came up and told us to get it (no smells, easy to use, compact), with his 2 kids and a pregnant wife.Baby in 1 hand, dirty diaper in the other, drop diaper in pail, flip bar, diaper is secured in bin. You only need 1 hand to use it. It's secure, it doesn't wobble.The pail WILL SMELL when you open it to change the bag for a new one. Otherwise, it keeps all the nasty smells inside the bin. We keep ours in the garage (have had it for 9 months) and have had no problems with smells (regardless of the weather 10- to 98 degrees). I estimate it holds up to 16 soiled diapers (we put the dirty wipes inside the dirty diaper so they are bulky).",2009,1248912000B000CCEWBYAYLAZUCGWB6IE,B000CCEWBY,AYLAZUCGWB6IE
315,positive,Wonderful for Safety,"I researched and researched forward facing car seats.  I debated buying this car seat for about a month.  I finally decided to buy it and I am glad I did.Positives:Easy to install.  It took us about 15 minutes to install with LATCH.(just read the instructions a couple of times and watch the video  on-line if you think you'll have trouble)The seat fits well forward facing in our car. (Pacifica)  It actually takes up less room then her infant carrier.It is easy to adjust the positions.  No loops, no straps to re-thread.My child appears comfortable and the HUGS system ensures nothing rubs on her.The safety rating is the best!Negatives:The Click and Safe feature is pointless.  It doesn't get snug enough, even though it ""clicks.""  It is actually harder to make the harness tight enough.  I wish we would have bought just the Boulevard.For the price, not a lot of features like cup holder. Not a big deal, but would have been nice.It does not fit well into my husbands Civic.  We are looking into a  smaller Britax.Overall, it is a wonderful seat.  It is easy to clean and I feel comfortable knowing my child is in a super safe top rated car seat.  I don't think I would use rear facing just because it doesn't have a removable base, so you would have to remove infant from seat to take in and out of home, store, ect.

316,positive,Pleasant Surprise,"I have a Medela Pump in Style for use at work -- it is faster and I can rig it through my bra to be hands-free.  I got the Avent Isis as a hand-me-down from my sister-in-law, who did not care for it at all.  I first tried it when I had a clogged duct, and I found it too painful.  But, I gave it a few more tries and have really come to appreciate this product.  Yes, it's kind of a nuisance to deal with all of the parts when cleaning, but it's quick and quiet, and when my daughter has a nap that's so long I get uncomfortable, it's so easy to grab this and squeeze out an ounce or two to make myself comfortable.  I imagine I will use it on days that I have to be out of the office during my usual pumping time, as I'm not about to lug the pump-in-style to court.

It helps to rearrange everything often.  He loves the teather ring.  We've also added some chimes (from another gym) that he thinks are great.  I don't know how long he'll be entertained by this now that he is crawling around some, but so far it's his favorite toy and allows me a good 20 minutes of free time - which for him is amazing!",2004,1095811200B0000936LRAWANCZMWZ16JF,B0000936LR,AWANCZMWZ16JF
319,positive,Swaddle Me in Microfleece!,"Whoever invented these SwaddleMe wraps ought to get some kind of prize. It's one of those products that you keep wondering what you would ever do without it. We have three SwaddleMe wraps for our new baby (now two months old and growing fast). Two are jersey and are now getting  little small for him. It's now getting a little cooler (late Fall), so we got a larger microfleece model. Junior seems to appreciate the extra warmth and room  I'd say the wrap is more effective and harder for him to get out of.A good wrap often quiets our baby down. He doesn't like getting wrapped and often cries loudly, but once he's wrapped he quiets down and even smiles. It's like magic. Somehow, when he can't flail his arms and legs around, he stops crying. Also, he seems to sleep better and for longer spells. Last night was the second of two 6-hour nights. That's worth the price in itself! Our little boy seems to like this fleece model a little better. Maybe he likes the extra warmth. Maybe it's the softness. Mabe it's the larger size. My wife worries a little that the fleece model seems to ride up onto his mouth and might suffocate him. Personally, I think she worries too much, but I'm a little more careful in wrapping him. I'd say, if he could speak, he'd say Swaddle Me in Microfleece.Gary Peterson",2008,1228521600B0009QYTIYAY12DBB0U420B,B0009QYTIY,AY12DBB0U420B

325,positive,Very Useful Sterilizer! Recommended!,"Being somewhat paranoid about germs when we had our first child, we were ultra careful with sterilizing EVERYTHING. This was a time consuming process and we likely spent much more energy than needed. By the time we had our second child, we were still careful but just not quite so much.Now we have the ""iQ24 Steam Sterilizer"" which drastically simplifies the sterilization process. With it's two modes of operation, we can choose to quick sterilize (6 minutes) or longer (keeps sterile for 24 hrs). We can't see any real need for the longer mode since the quick mode keeps the bottles sterile for 6 hrs.This really beats having to boil bottles on the stove like we did for my first two children and saves us a lot of time and energy. As one other reviewer noted, the iQ24 does not clean the bottles! You must wash the bottles before putting them in the Sterilizer.As a side note, my science minded daughter has already claimed the iQ24 for use in science projects since she knows that it can also be used to sterilize lab equipment and Petri Dishes. Not quite an autoclave but usable.Note that this does not come with bottles!For time and energy saving convenience, highly recommended! For a less expensive solution, check out the microwaveable version,Philips Avent Express II Microwave Steam Sterilizer without Bottle",2008,1229472000B001C3MHF0A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,B001C3MHF0,A3OXHLG6DIBRW8

We bought our first set 7 years ago to use with our first child.  One set of Grandparents use them and an aunt too.  I am just about to get a second set because we have a new crawler and I want to put them on the bathroom cabinets.  They are a bit expensive but you will never need to buy locks again.  We prefer to leave our on at all times (even when our children don't need the cabinets locked anymore) because they are easy to turn off (just a flip of the red tab inside the cabinet) that way they are there whenever you have little ones visiting your home.  We have never split a cabinet and we don't think it takes that much longer to install then any other cabinet locks.  You will have to drill in you cupboard doors but your little one(s) will be protected.  It leaves no room for fingers to get pinched either.  If you do happen to lose your lock you can buy a strong magnet from your home improvement store and still get it open.  We like to keep our lock on the metal frame by the kitchen window above the sink.  Good luck whatever you decide.,2009,1237939200B0000488W2A2D1KIELA53FAE,B0000488W2,A2D1KIELA53FAE

It's long enough to cover his lap beyond the highchair tray (if you don't use a tray, part of the legs will still be exposed for spills). The neck is high enough to cover his collar which used to get hit even with a bib.  It's really easy to clean, and I'm no longer afraid to let my child feed himself goopy, staining foods! It's completely worth it and I wish I'd had it since he started solids. Later edit: We've now had this smock for about 2 years and it's barely showing signs of wear. I throw it in the laundry about once a week for a thorough cleaning and just wipe it down with a paper towel between meals. The best way to get it clean is to turn it inside out in the wash and then hang it over a chair. It will dry extremely fast and get really clean. If you don't turn it inside out, the sleeves have a hard time drying on the inside where the absorbent fabric is.

I liked the idea of taking it from room to room like others have said, but I'm finding that in reality, with a baby in one arm, I just can't.  It's a little bit awkward to carry one-handed, and the legs, when open, are too wide to fit through the doorways of my 1850's apartment so I'd need to put the baby down to fold it-- too many steps!

First, the way in which the hanging toys are attached to the activity bar is different than what is pictured. They do not go through loops that hang down from the bar, but rather velcro onto it. That's fine, except the velcro is backwards, in my opinion, for the cow. Or, the cow needs to have a face on both sides! The way it attaches, the baby looks at the back of it's blank white head! The cow should be for the baby, not the parents to look at! Also, the vibration is really, really loud -- at least without a baby sitting in the seat. I assume the baby's body muffles the sound, since no one else noted this in their review. On the positive side, it was simple to assemble and you can use it up to 40 lbs!",2005,1108425600B0002ZOI9WA24ZVNHFYQPLAL,B0002ZOI9W,A24ZVNHFYQPLAL
344,positive,This monitor is amazing!,"We just set up our son's nursery and tested out the Sony monitor. I sat in the nursery opposite side of the room from the monitor and whispered as quietly as I could as my husband walked all over our house. He could hear me everywhere he went, both upstairs and down.We were a little concerned with finding a monitor that would work for us, because we live in an old Victorian house with plaster walls. To use cell phones in our house, you have to stand by a window and not move or you will lose your call. The Sony 27 channel monitor worked perfectly!

347,positive,Inexpensive Cups with Straws,"I had been using the Take and Toss ones in the sippy cups and saw these with the straws. It's one step closer to moving my son to using regular cups. He feels like a big boy using a cup and straw instead of a sippy cup like his baby brother.They last with repeated use for several months then ours eventually develop a crack in them from being thrown on the floor. I do hand wash mine even though they state top-rack dishwasher safe and I believe that helps them last a little longer.  My sons are at the age where we are transitioning them from sippy cups to regular cups and these are perfect for that in-between stage.These are also labeled plastic type 5 which is polypropylene which is considered safe and does not leach BPA (bisphenol-A) into foods and beverages like some plastics can. That makes me feel better and sets my mind at ease about using these with my children.Make sure that you put the lid on the cup and then insert the straw. If you are refilling and take the top off with the straw still in and then replace, liquid will come shooting out the straw.",2008,1218067200B0000BX8LVALNFHVS3SC4FV,B0000BX8LV,ALNFHVS3SC4FV
348,positive,Great Pump with a Great Price,"I have loved this pump.  I have used it since I got home from the hospital and my daughter is now 10 weeks old.  The only other pump I have experience with is the Medela Symphony in the hospital.  I found the 3 minute letdown feature annoying on it.  The Hygeia Enjoye jumps right in just like the baby and works well.  It pumped better for me than the Symphony did in the hospital.  I have never had any complications with it and use it daily, sometimes multiple times.  I understand the reason for the baby recording button, however, I find it silly and annoying since I seem to hit it by accident.  I have not had issues with pumping so it may be useful if you do.  I would recommend this pump to anyone and love that it is more green and can safely be reused by others.  Nothing has broke or worn out.  I could think of a few improvements like the ability to pump into storage bags, etc, however, for the price and quality I give it 5 bright stars.",2009,1256169600B0028MI4M4A2MQ7X9MMX3XQZ,B0028MI4M4,A2MQ7X9MMX3XQZ
349,positive,Worth the cost!!!,"These bottles are a true must have!  They are the only worthwhile bottles on the market and are well worth the extra price as well as the extra time to wash.  They really limit the gas intake and we never had an issue with leaking bottles, like so many other brands.  It is a bit of a hassle to get all the pieces in the dishwasher.  I like the wide neck bottles because they are closer to breast feeding and when my son got older, it was easier for him to hold the bottle on his own.",2008,1201651200B0000936M4A2LYF3DJN9X5JN,B0000936M4,A2LYF3DJN9X5JN
350,positive,"Loud, but good","This pump is very good.  I had to pump while my daughter was in the hospital the first month of her life.  During the day I used the hospital grade pumps at the hospital, but at night I used this pump until finally buying the double electric Medela pump. I got just as much milk with this pump as I did the hospital pump.  I only used the electric plug, never batteries.  It is a handy pump to have.  I don't see how a nursing mom can go without ever having to pump at some point, even if its for cereal when they start that. Medela is definitely the best pump to get, and don't even think about a manual one.  I never pump now since I'm home with my baby, but I am so glad I have this pump. It is definitely loud, but putting a folded towel over it helps.  If you have to pump a lot, and can afford it, a double pump is the way to go though...it takes half the time, which is very important when you have a baby to take care of.",2004,1086912000B000056HMVA3Q0XNQUB1EILY,B000056HMV,A3Q0XNQUB1EILY

353,positive,Very durable and sturdy,"This is very heavy so that it cannot be lifted by any young child. My 8 year old cannot lift it.  But it can slide a little if your child puts their weight on it. It will not topple over as this is impossible. I use it to block my garage so that my 2 year old doesn't run out of the garage and into the street. Once your child is too big to fit in a playpen, you can get this so that they have more room to play, but still have them contained.It is very difficult during the first few times you open and close it. But it does loosen up and becomes easy enough to setup alone. It is actually better that the joints don't move so easily so that your child cannot change the shape of the play yard when they push against it.",2009,1248825600B00020L78MA5CDMTW6JKV5G,B00020L78M,A5CDMTW6JKV5G

363,positive,This is a great invention!,"I love our wipe warmer!  I've also seen some of the negative feedback, and I don't have of those problems at all!  If you follow the directions with the package, your wipe warmer will be fine!  The Ever-Fresh pad at the bottom does dry out, but we just re-wet it each time we replace the wipes.  I've never had any wipes get brown or dried out.  The wipes stay warm long enough for me to use them - I just make sure to pull out a wipe as I need it.  And yes, some wipes are not made for the top part that allows another wipe to pull out after.  But all you need to do is buy the wipes that are folded that way.  I buy the Especially for Baby wipes in the big box.  You can get them at any Babies R Us or Toys R Us.  It costs about $10, and lasts us for over a month.  Plus, they're nice and soft and have no scent.The ONLY complaint I might have about the wipe warmer is that when I pull out a wipe, another wipe usually comes out with it unless I use 2 hands to pull.  But this is a minor issue.  I'd much prefer to have the wipe warmer.

365,positive,Doesn't Require Batteries!!,"As a first-time mom to a now 6 month old boy, I have run the gamut in terms of baby toys.  This is one of the best I have come across so far.  It's durable and educational.  I love that it doesn't matter what end you set it on.  There is no upside-down to this toy.  My son can pick it up and move it around with one hand, so it isn't too heavy, which is definitely a bonus.  He likes hearing the sand/rattle sound when I turn it over for him.  He likes to spin the little pieces and/or watch me spin them.  There is so much to see and do with this toy, and I love that the creators of it didn't feel the need to design it with all kinds of flashing lights, silly songs, and other bells and whistles.  If you want a good, basic, entertaining, educational (and I might even venture old-fashioned in some ways) toy, you should definitely get this one.  My son has to actually do something with this toy rather than listen to it and watch some lights flash.  I'm a little tired of all the toys that I've come across that don't really do anything except drain batteries.

My favorite feature is that it doesn't require special refills--it can use any trash bag (we just use a tall kitchen trash bag).  My 3 1/2 year old still hasn't figured out how to open it, but it's easy enough for me to open quickly.  The only times I have had a problem with odors is if too many diapers are stuffed into the pail.  Even then, these odors can be minimized with a bit of baking soda sprinkled in the bottom of the pail.Although I debate the necessity of ANY diaper pail, this one receives 5 stars from me!",2004,1088035200B00003TL7PA2XUQN9HUD6ISG,B00003TL7P,A2XUQN9HUD6ISG
371,positive,Almost perfect,"I like this wrap a lot and I am really into baby-wearing.  The fabric is really soft and it comes in so many nice colors.  My daughter loves it, too.  My only problem is that it's a little complicated.  It's not easy enough to get it on and off.  And when my baby wakes up and wants to be fed, I'd really like to be able to get us out of the wrap faster (sometimes I am able to just shift her around and feed her in the wrap).  My only other issue is that it's very warm - and I live in a hot climate.  She can't wear it for too long without getting overheated and fussy.  I don't think this will be as big of a problem next summer, though, when I can use .  I've started using the maya wrap more, because it's easier and cooler, but it's not as versatile.

372,positive,awesome,"Love this stroller.  It is a breeze to assemble, light, easy to carry.  It folds compactly with one hand (wonders when you're holding a chunky squirmer), turns on a dime, and the handles are comfortable for extended walks.  The front wheels can be locked for pushing over grass or other rougher surfaces, and surprisingly it works really well.  My 6 month old rides in it with no trouble, and it will easily accomodate her growing little body for well over a year.  The seat is cushioned, the ride is smooth.  Two drawbacks - the sunshade doesn't extend out very far, offering limited protection at best.  It also attaches kind of funky - you have to fold back the fabric on the side bars and snap it over a little button, which doesn't hold it securely at all.  I overcame this by purchasing a rayshade by kiddtopomus for $11.  The other minor drawback is that the seat does not come up all the way.  It lets down smoothly for sleeping, but baby has to sit slightly reclined when it is pulled up as far as it will go.  My girl doesn't seem to mind this at all, but other babies might.  I don't have a problem with the small storage area underneath, or the lack of cup-holders.  If you're not struggling with juggling a baby AND a bag, it is pretty easy to push a stroller and sip on drink.",2009,1240531200B000UEDH42A2G5YYK19RH1X8,B000UEDH42,A2G5YYK19RH1X8

384,positive,Best bottle system. Period.,I understand that some people might have a problem with this bottle type. If you screw the top on crooked at all or too tightly - you may have issues. But if you take a second and make sure that you are screwing on the top properly - you might have a leaking bottle once every 30 or 40 tries. I have used 4 of the other top brands and am very pleased with Avent. The Brownies are really good too - but just too hard to clean on a regular basis. If you only use a bottle once in a while - use browns - but if you use them a lot - get Avent. Only way to go.,2007,1187395200B000056HNXA226VGZWOEBPGL,B000056HNX,A226VGZWOEBPGL
385,positive,Good for grabbing,"I like this toy because my almost 6-month old son can easily grab and hold on to it.  However, he's at the stage where he wants to put everything in his mouth, and he tends to get frustrated becaues this doesn't really lend itself to being chewed on.  I think he'll like it more when he can play with it like a ball, rather than trying to use it as a teether.",2009,1253664000B001UF8BL4A3VWTB09FI0MCQ,B001UF8BL4,A3VWTB09FI0MCQ
386,negative,"Maybe, maybe not","The product looks and functions more or less as expected, well much more like less.  Unfortunately, the plastic is weak and overly flexible, whereas it should be strong  to resist bending it off.  Also, the locking mechanism is too easy.  The product doesn't work well on straight knobs that don't have anything to hang on to. I don't recommend this product for a cabinet you really want to keep secure.  If a child is incapable of removing this then it also means s/he can't open a door either, because it is so easy to remove, so don't get it.After using this product for over a year as an infant has grown into a toddler, my opinion of it has gone down further.  The plastic is so flexible that it is very easy for a child to take it off.  If anything, this product is more of a toy than a barrier.  I have tried it with several kinds of drawer knobs and it doesn't work with any of them.",2007,1186876800B000I68QHAAWI6BQXM3A4CX,B000I68QHA,AWI6BQXM3A4CX

388,positive,Love it! Bought it for my daughter but I use it instead!,"I originally bought this for my daughter's lunches, but it's so darn cute and the size is just right to fit in my bag that I ended up using it and bought her something else. So - if you eat a huge meal, I guess it wont work for you, but your average sandwich, chips, fruit and/or cookie plus napkin fits in just fine. Plus it's super easy to clean and has thermal properties.So - not just for kids :o)",2009,1253145600B000ST6Y58A2YCEKVUN1W5F1,B000ST6Y58,A2YCEKVUN1W5F1

390,positive,A Miracle Seat,"We got this infant seat from a local Once Upon a Child. We hadn't read any of the reviews, but picks it because of its soft seat and soft-pastel colors. Our baby passed out in it for hours in her first few weeks. Then, she hated sitting there and cried endelessly whenever we placed her there. We tried attaching the bunny, but she hated that even more. As she neared 8 weeks old, she learned to find comfort in a pacifier and would accept sitting there with a pacifier to sleep...sometimes.Today, she is 10 weeks old and I finally had the sense to install batteries in it! Following a fit of 15 minutes of nonstop crying, she cried on and off for another 10 mintes to the vibrations and music, then passed out altogether. This is the first day in almost two weeks that she has fallen so soundly asleep there. The music is gorgeous, by the way.Another plus is is compact foldability. Very easy to fold and carry from location to location. I wish this were the case for all baby gear, although if you research and choose wisely, there are plenty of options out there.We LOVE that it is so soft and accomodates up to 25 pounds. Our 2 and 3/4 year old son is only about 22-23 pounds and still sits there.Be careful to always buckle baby in or else she slides downwards pretty easily and quickly.",2009,1261094400B000I5REU6AFCFQZWVOKSMC,B000I5REU6,AFCFQZWVOKSMC
391,positive,What a lifesaver!,This product has made bath time a completely fun experience with NO TEARS! My 21 month old daughter hated to get her hair rinsed either by laying her down to rinse or pour water over her head.  She would always duck her head and end up getting it into her eyes.  This solves our problem.  It suctions around her head perfectly and leaves her face completely dry while completely rinsing her hair.  I wish I would have found and purchased this sooner!,2009,1260403200B001B1C7R6A103NIIU3EJZIG,B001B1C7R6,A103NIIU3EJZIG

393,positive,so conveniant,"I love this system because it's so easy. Rather that washing the bottle you can just change the liner and wash the nipple. I use store brand non-drop-ins because theyre cheaper and the regular ""bag"" liner colapses easier.I agree with other reveiwers, the slow flow nipples that come with the bottle are worthless. My 1 month old gets frusterated that nothing is coming out. We tried the tri-cut and again he got frusterated so i ripped the cut a little bigger and that works so I went and got the fast flow.",2005,1125100800B00008614FA2MNP2DJ9XMVXP,B00008614F,A2MNP2DJ9XMVXP
394,positive,These are my nursing pads of choice.,"Yes these pads are thicker than most.  I usually put them over my fist and try to shape them ""rounder"" before I put them in my bra.I like these the best because they don't have the plastic liner on the backs.  This is important to me because I don't want ""liquid"" locked in between plastic and my skin.  Also, I don't feel as if they are as ""hot"".I wish I could say they were too small but I have found them to be the perfect size for smaller women A-B cups.

395,positive,a must have,"I love this product. You can use any regular trash bag. So far we have noticed NO odors. It is easy to use. It fills up somewhat quickly, but you can make it last longer by wrapping diapers tightly before placing in the champ.

396,positive,"Entertains, but with a few quirks","My daughter loves being in her swing.. and usually falls asleep in it.. I can count on at least an hour or 2 of 'me' time when shes sleeping in it.  It goes with the rest of the Windsor products I have, but here are my complaints about the swing...1. The motor is a bit noisy, but does not overbear the music.2. In order to snap the tray down, I have to bend it a bit.. it does not align perfectly with the end it snaps onto.3. I wish there was a locking option for when I put my daughter in the chair, so the swing wouldn't move when Im trying to put her in it.4. I had the same problem with the mobile falling to the back, but if you move the arm forward enough, it doesn't fall back, but it wont turn, because the bears hit the area where the motor is. I'd rather it not turn than her not see it at all.5. I can only find the tray toys online at the Graco website, but they give you no description.6. You're supposed to be able to fold it up, but I haven't figured it out yet.. looks like I'll have to find the manual.I gave it 4 stars because it looks nice and it does do the job its supposed to do (entertain my daughter) which is the most important thing to me..",2005,1134345600B0002FQVJCA3M666LJCG5W0G,B0002FQVJC,A3M666LJCG5W0G
397,positive,Wonderful!,"Before this swing my son only slept well when he co-slept with me.  Now I have this swing next to my bed and he sleeps in this swing every night.  It rocks him to sleep and he'll stay comfortably asleep in it for most of the night.  Recently we traveled and I dissembled it (an easy process) and packed it in a suitcase with the rest of his stuff.  He was able to sleep comfortably, just the same as usual, while we were away from home.  That alone is priceless!  I like the ability to set the timer for it to turn off and I like that the music isn't obnoxious.  Also, it seems like when you are on the lowest levels the swing is hardly moving.  This is a great transition for the swing stopping and can help baby sleep in it longer.  The portability of this swing in great -- I've taken it into the bathroom to have him close while I get ready for the day and I've taken it to our backyard so that I can watch our older child play.  We have a full sized cradle swing we keep in the living room for during the day, but I wouldn't want to live without this as our nighttime and traveling swing.",2009,1252108800B000NUJM0GA357TTTJ9Q11LB,B000NUJM0G,A357TTTJ9Q11LB
398,positive,Very Soothing!,"This swing really does all that it offers. You'll save on buying a bouncer since this is included. As for the noise, it does make a slight sound, but not as loud as the previous reviews made it out to be. I tried the other swings before ordering this one since I heard about the noise, and they all either make some type of clicking/moving sound due to the movement. If your sweet peace is really that loud, then you may consider returning it. On the down side, it is a bit expensive for a swing, but then there are those other extra options you pay for.",2008,1199232000B000WIEH2CA1G8YTVIKK9SW6,B000WIEH2C,A1G8YTVIKK9SW6

I am a pretty small woman (about a size 8) and I found that the donut-hole in the middle was so small it buckled in the front when I tried to put it around my waist.  Not only that, but it really needs to sit around the hips in order to be low enough to rest the baby on -- and that never worked, it just kept riding up to my waist. And because it's so round and puffy, I had to use just as much muscle to keep my baby from rolling away from me as I would have to hold him up!

It plays tunes when peed in, although as the baby soon figured out, if you bounce up and down hard enough, it will play, diluting the reward feature. I am happy with it.

I was instructed by my pediatrician to boil all nursing items for 20 minutes due to my daughter having recurring Thrush.  I put this nurser in with other bottles my daughter had used that day because she touched the bottle repeatedly during feedings after having her hands in Thrush infested mouth.  This nurser shrunk like a shrinky-dink!  It shrunk to about 1/4 of it normal size.  Strangest thing I have ever seen.

426,positive,Wonderful tub from birth on up!,"I agree with many of the other reviews ... there is no need for a pricey bathtub, this one works fantastic!  The 3 stages of this tub (newborn, infant and toddler) will make it a useful item for a long time.  The sling feature is perfect for newborns.  The non skid pads in the infant side are a great feature, and the high angled back is very supportive.  The tub is a great size -- not too large to store and fits in most standard sinks (I have a 1 1/2 size sink).  We've moved into the upstairs bathtub, and I just place this inside the tub while our little guy kicks and splashes.  At 26 inches he still fits nicely in the infant side -- we have not yet moved to the deeper seated end for toddlers yet.  We may just move to a tub seat when he can sit well enough.  This is a great tub and a great value for the price.",2006,1143072000B000067EH7A1G9SNNWU5XAI9,B000067EH7,A1G9SNNWU5XAI9

The clear side of the rattle has a spinner in it with three different sides:  a bullseye, a ladybug, and a mirror.  I love twirling the spinner for my son.  It's very relaxing to watch - almost hypnotic.  This toy reminds me of the kind of stuff I had and loved as a baby.  In the age of overstimulating toys, this one earns five stars from our family for being super inexpensive, captivating, and simple.",2009,1257984000B002L3T9VAA1DI7KMBSK5MTU,B002L3T9VA,A1DI7KMBSK5MTU

This holds the soothie, but so will any other paci clip with a string loop at the end, like the booginhead one (nothing special there).

430,positive,Love it (and true: the remote is really not that necessary!),"My two cents about this fantastically designed mobile by the Tiny Love folks: our two-month old gets &quot;hipnotized&quot; by the figures SO MUCH, that the truth is he stops noticing anything else aruond him. This is why the remote is not that big of a deal: he doesn't really mind if you come in or out of the room, and as a matter of fact, he even loves the mobile if it's stopped. As for the figures, they are very colorful and well designed too... and the elephant is just too funny, twisting like crazy because of his extra weight).All in all, a highly recommended mobile (any Tiny Love), but if you want to save a few bucks ($10 I think it is), skip the Deluxe version and get the regular one.",2003,1071619200B00006G963A1IANEBSMVGHS9,B00006G963,A1IANEBSMVGHS9

The Diaper Genie was so hard to use and didn't do anything to stop odors. My son's room smelled as if we threw the dirty diapers in an open garbage. And the fact that you have to buy their ""special bags"" added insult to injury.We replaced it with THE FIRST YEARS CLEAN AIR DIAPER DISPOSAL SYSTEM. It's so much more effective and easy to use than the Diaper Genie, and you use your own tall kitchen garbage bags.The greatest thing about The First Years Clean Air Systen is that it can store about 6-7 days of my son's diapers without NO yucky odors. WOW!! We love this product so much. Our son's room smells clean with no poopy odors, and we save money by using our own tall kitchen bags. It's also very easy to change--no confusing bag twisting.STAY AWAY FROM THE DIAPER GENIE.

He hits his heels on it all the time (we removed it since he we never really used it). He has since trained himself to not put his feet near it (he got little bruises on his heels), and other than that he loves this seat. We even broke it down and took it with us on vacation.

437,negative,Hard to put together and very leaky.,"I was very excited to get my son this cup to drink out of. I thought it would keep his drinks cold in the summer and be easy for him to use.I am very disappointed.  The cup's parts do pull apart for easy cleaning but the spout is very hard to get back into the lid and almost impossible to line up exactly right.  I am not sure if it is because of this that the cup leaks.  After messing around with the lid for a good 10 minutes and thinking that it was on good; the cup *still* leaked.I am not talking about leaking from my 15 month old throwing the cup around either.  We had this cup sitting in the cup holder in his stroller and 5 minutes of movement from the stroller (at the zoo) caused it to leak out a puddle of milk into the cup holder.  We ended up having to throw out the remainder of the milk and beg some napkins from a zoo snack stand attendant to sop up the mess.  I am really frustrated that this cup leaks with even normal (not toddler like) use.  The fact that ""leak-proof"" is in the title is really ironic...In summary:Pros- Keeps things cold- Easy to cleanCons- Hard to pop the spout back in- Leaks very easy (we are talking that it leaks while sitting in the stroller.)- Really, really leaks!",2008,1211846400B000O3PFVWA22B13EJTZKCTM,B000O3PFVW,A22B13EJTZKCTM

The material is nice and light, excellent quality, and the baby blue with navy stitching is a lovely color.However, it just doesn't match up to the Moby.  I never felt like my baby was truely secure in his spot while in the Ktan.  Though the Moby takes a bit of trial and error to get the wrapping down pat, it has a pannel you can pull over the baby which secures everything in place.  The Ktan is missing this last piece.  You also have to buy the correct size so if you and your partner are different sizes, you have to buy two.

It may have for the first week or two, but now at 3 1/2 months it SMELLS BAD.  I guess the diapers have gotten stinkier.  What can I say?The other thing that drives me nuts is that the first few diapers I put in after a refill change never go in correctly.  No matter how many times I twist after the first diaper, the second one always pushes right through the first twist and ends up hanging in the bottom - un-sausage-linked.

I had a few swaddlers from First YearsThe First Years Easy-Wrap Swaddler - Yellow (much cheaper and worked better), but my son outgrew them.  So, I decided to try the Miracle Blanket.  I wish I hadn't spent the money.  First, the price is very high.  Second, it's a long blanket that wraps--there are no closures (velcro, snaps, etc), so he tends to slip down into the blanket, and the arm flaps bunch up in his armpits (uncomfortable).  What's worse, the blanket unravels and wraps around his neck.  Scary!  He gets very hot in this blanket (despite central A/C and ceiling fan--his back and neck are drenched!), and overheating is another risk factor for SIDS.  Oh, and forget about ""quick"" middle-of-the-night diaper changes--it's nearly impossible to get his legs out of the bottom pouch, so wrestling him out of the blanket wakes him up.

I also let her (danger danger!!) sleep on it at occassional naps. If I was sitting in my bed reading, I'd lay her next to me on her noggin nest for a nap. (Nothing dangerous there.) I wouldn't let her sleep on it at night, or anytime she wouldn't be constantly supervised. At any rate, by 3 months, the doctor said she had improved immensely, we'd just keep an eye on it. We kept using it & at 4 months, he said we didn't even need to worry about it anymore. I used it for a few more weeks after that, until she started turning her head a lot more at night & started sitting up. Now I only use it in her activity rocker as a pillow because she likes.

When that happens, I have just added a bit of water and it restores them nicely. I found that the bottom wipe does turn brown but only when I keep adding the fresh wipes to the top and the bottom ones were older. Now I remove the whole remaining stack and add new ones to the bottom. Even if they are slightly brown, it just looks weird. I'm pretty sure the wipes are just fine.I do wish that it came with a pop-up adapter or something. I like the Pamper's pop-up wipes but find it difficult to pull one out because they are inner-folded and stick together. It works better with the Huggies wipes.The only other issue is that the lid collects condensed water and I am afraid of it leaving a puddle on our furniture.

She sat there for a moment, kicked the bar, activing the musical star.  Then, in a moment I will remember for the rest of my life, she smiled for the first time.It did not take her long to figure out that kicking the bar would make the star play a song for her.  She loved this toy for many months (until she learned to crawl).This is a wonderful toy for young babies.  Some of the toys rattle, and the bright primary colors easily attract a baby's attention.  My daughter especially enjoyed looking at the ladybug.  The star is detatachable and made many trips to Grandma's house with us to place in her pack and play.

You HAVE to remember that. When you overtighten the lid, the nipple gets distorted and the seal is broken. My husband and others in the family have had this problem. It is probably always helpful to test for leaks (when you test the temp of the milk) BEFORE you give it to the baby, just to make sure.I like the plastic they use. It has always felt extremely sturdy. They are easily to hold (thanks to the curve) and I really like the wide mouth of the bottles which make them easy to clean....and you are pretty sure they are clean!!I bought the newborn starter set and the infant set and together they are all I require for bottles and a breastmilk storage set!!

Once it got too warm for his carseat I put it in his Graco Quattro Tour and he loves it.  He stays all nice and warm.

473,negative,Can Be Frustrating,"After my Medela Harmony suddonly quit working, I was in a rush for a new pump and ended up getting the Avent Isis.  At first I thought I had purchased a dud, but after a few minutes the pump grabbed on big time, and I was expressing milk faster than I ever had with the Harmony.  I do find that this pump works better for me when I remove the rubber ""petal"" lining.  And this pump can be squeeky.  The most frustrating thing for me though is that after using it for a little over a month the little white disk would pop out of place, just when I would get a really strong suction going.  Then I would have to stop and take the pump apart to get the disk back in position.  Also, the wide bottles don't fit very well in the bottle compartment of my diaper bag, and my daughter is not use to the wide nipples.  I use the Avent bottles to store milk, but I use the Medela bottles for feeding, which is kind of hassle compared to being able to pump directly into the feeding bottle.",2005,1123545600B000066CMVA9REEKTBGZ5W0,B000066CMV,A9REEKTBGZ5W0

475,negative,Annoying.,"We have a toddler and we were told that we just had to get a guard for the DVD, and for other electronic things as well. It seems that babies like to push buttons. Well, that figures. Our boy has been trained with a bunch of musical toys that require button punching and he learned rather quickly. He loves them! It's only a matter of time before he gets to the stereo, TV and DVD player, hence we bought this Parent Units DVD/CD guard.I'm annoyed by this product. It's just a piece of transparent plastic with a couple small velcro straps yet it cost 20% that of the very sophisticated DVD/CD player. What goes? Second, if we use it as illustrated, we will have to remove the guard before each using in order to get the little disc drawer to open. Furthermore, our DVD player is on a small shelf and we cannot remove the guard without removing the DVD player from the shelf first. What a nuisance! I've gotten around this by using the guard upside down. The long flange of the plastic goes under the front legs of the DVD player and the short flange then covers the controls. OK, but we still have to remove the guard before each using of the player It's an annoyance. We're considering putting the DVD player at a higher level out of his reach.Gary Peterson",2009,1259020800B000096LWXAY12DBB0U420B,B000096LWX,AY12DBB0U420B

I use a Medela breast pump and the Born-Free bottles, like the Avent bottles, do not fit on the pump.  The Dr. Brown's bottles do fit the Medela pump connectors.  Like other reviewers have stated, the nipples on these bottles collapses and there are extra parts that seem useless, just more stuff to clean.  It is easier for my son to hold the Dr. Brown's bottles also.  I would not recommend these, there are far better bottles out there, we also use Momo glass bottles, and I am very pleased with them.",2008,1219622400B000MRGML2A2BHK4FHWSRKQJ,B000MRGML2,A2BHK4FHWSRKQJ
477,positive,Works GREAT for bubbles!!,I use these bottles and avent bottles (i have an avent pump)and noticed that with the avent bottles my milk had a horrible amount of bubbles.  These ones have NO BUBBLES!  which means its probably better feeling for baby! The size one flow is perfect for my son.  He burps as soon as you sit him up (this might just be because he is a fast burper?  every baby is different) and he has spit up only twice.  (He is one week old)The only problem I have is that I cannot find an adapter that will fit my avent pump and fit these bottles to pump directly into them which makes the avent bottles a little more convenient with breastmilk and playtex doesnt make a hand pump.When I decide to stop pumping I'll definitely give him these bottles exclusively.,2005,1123286400B00005BTNAA29GU2CT4AJTXP,B00005BTNA,A29GU2CT4AJTXP
478,positive,Helped me get started,"These were a huge help getting started on my first baby. I bought them on a whim and boy was a glad. They help get my milk started because they apply a light pressure which also helps extent the nipple. They keep things (such as a bra) from rubbing against very very sore nipples. Another great feature is the air vents at the top of the cups. They are there to get air to nipple, (you don't want them getting dried out, that just makes the pain of feeding much worse). Determined breastfeeding mom's these are fantastic until your milk supply comes in at a steady pace.They do not look flattering under a TIGHT fitting shirt (loose is always best anyways) but what does when you are breastfeeding for the first few months as things are adjusting.

It is smooth and soft and you roll it out using the roller included with the kit.  I should mention that the material stuck to the wooden roller that came with the kit and the directions state that if this happens, to use a round tin can.  That worked for me!  The other thing I had trouble with was the plastic ring that came with the kit; I just used a bowl.You do have to push a bit hard to make a solid impression in the material.  A straw is included to make the holes at the top for the ribbon.  I used a toothpick and pin-pricked the year at the bottom.  It came out beautiful!

481,positive,Great for when your baby gets too big to be swaddled,"When our son started escaping from the receiving blankets we'd swaddle him in, we started using a sleep sack.  It took a couple of weeks for him to adjust to it, but now he loves it and goes right to sleep when we put it on him and set him in the crib.  He is 30 inches tall and about to outgrow the medium, so we have a large ready for him.  He rolls all over the crib during the night and the sleep sack moves with him.  It is never pulled tight or twisted.  We dress him in something with long sleeves so that his arms stay warm and during the colder winter nights we added ""No-Scratch Mittens"" from Babies R Us to keep his hands warm.  When our son was still in a bassinet, the sleep sack worked well with a sleep positioner to keep him on his back.  When swaddled he would scoot out of the positioner, but with the sleep sack his arms were above the positioner and he stayed in place.  I've washed both a cotton and a fleece sleep sack dozens of times and they held up great.  There's no shrinking, fading or unraveling and the zippers still work perfectly.  The sleep sack is the perfect way for our son to stay warm at night and I am so glad I have it.",2005,1110672000B00008KWO1A1Q1T811N4IY3Z,B00008KWO1,A1Q1T811N4IY3Z

It is easy for her to grip and it's very smooth- no splinters, after 4 months- but maybe it's just not her thing. But it's well made and once in a while she will gnaw on it for a bit.

487,negative,Doesn't work!,"This product is poorly designed. There's a rubber insert on the flat side which you're supposed to press against your child's head to make a seal so the water only flows back from that point. Two problems: first, the rubber is so rigid you can't get a good seal without pressing REALLY hard. The second, and biggest, problem is that the rubber insert doesn't go all the way to the edges of the cup. There is a space of about 3mm at each side where the water just gushes out. Because of where you'd have the cup positioned on your child's head, this means the water goes in their ears, down both sides of their face and even some into the eyes. Since it's water in the eyes which really freaks my kid out, it's useless to us.She does enjoy stuffing her other bath toys in it though so we have got some use out of it.",2008,1226102400B001GI4FXIA34Q4EQENBHPN7,B001GI4FXI,A34Q4EQENBHPN7

Now there is!After having a small choking incident, which I was able to react quickly to, I bought this to relieve some of my fears.  I had heard good things about this product but this is something you HAVE to experience for yourself.I found it so nice to be able to offer my daughter bananas, grapes, potatoes, and so much more without having to worry about her taking in to big of a piece and choking.  With the baby safe feeder, your child knaws or sucks on the mesh and the food is dispensed in small quantities that are safe to be swalled by little mouths.I loved this item even more when teething time came around.  I could drop one or two ice cubes in the bag and my daughter would be on cloud nine.  She never cared for those teething rings or other teething toys, this was it for us.  She would hold onto the handle and suck cube uppon cube of ice until her pains were relieved.I think every parent should own one of these, it is inexpensive and well worth the money.",2003,1070928000B000056JCYAHGG8UV27DSUT,B000056JCY,AHGG8UV27DSUT
505,positive,THE ONLY Swaddle blanket that works for us!,"We have tried the Swaddle Me, the Swaddle Blanket, and the Miracle Blanket.  The ONLY one our daughter (now two - she used it for about 3 months) and now our 2 month old son does not break out of is the Miracle Blanket.ADVANTAGES* Works differently than others - holds arms at side with two ""flaps"" that tuck under the body (uses body weight), and then a longer piece wraps around the baby.  The end result is a very tight but comfortable looking coocoon that works!*  NO VELCRO - The velcro on the Swaddle Me kept waking our daughter up!*  Keeps them warm with nothing else required.DISADVANTAGES*  The part that swaddles the bottom half of the body sometimes come loose - you have to make sure that you wrap the blanket around the lower half o the body REALLY well!*  Nothing else we can think of",2007,1185494400B000G0J5FUAI8QTTC152O19,B000G0J5FU,AI8QTTC152O19

507,positive,excellent for the price,"I love that special pricey bags or refills are not needed with this diaper pail.  It does a pretty decent job of keeping out the smell, but with how stinky my son's poos are, I still tie poopy diapers in a plastic shopping bag before putting it in the pail (also keeps from getting yucky stuff of my hands when I push it into the pail).  I do wish that this was hands-free like my other pail, but it works much better on smell.  If you want to completely eliminate diaper odors you'll have to take each diaper out of the house immediately.",2008,1210032000B0009A4FBQAR19RAV5NYX6Z,B0009A4FBQ,AR19RAV5NYX6Z
508,positive,EXCELLENT With the SAFER BATHER,"This is an EXCELLENT bath tub for my 3 week old. We put in the Safer Bather and fill the tub with our detachable shower head and bath time is soooo simple....Just remember to cork the plug at the bottom of the tub...SO for you mom's looking for a tub for your infant this is the one, just don't forget to buy the safer bather to go along with it..this will keep you from having to hold the baby while bathing her, just lean her back into the cushion and wash with BOTH HANDS!!!!Note: I didn't buy this tub to fit into my kitchen sink...Use it as a mini bath tub that can fit on a diningroom table, in your regular sized tub or on the floor...since I only have a stand up shower I put it on the floor of the shower and use my detachable shower head...It works GREAT!!!!",2005,1131494400B000067EH7A1I7BJSEVHW2DU,B000067EH7,A1I7BJSEVHW2DU
509,negative,Horrible.,"I am a first time mother. One thing that I have learned is never to pick something beacause you like the pattern. I love the Windsor pattern, so I figured I would register for all of the items in Windsor print. I recevied them all. The item I like the least is the swing. It wasn't exactly easy to put together. The mobile was the hardest part. Once you think you get it on, it just keeps falling off. I got so aggravated, I just gave up and kept the mobile off. When my six month old son falls asleep his head always ends up falling to the side or in his lap, no matter how far it is reclined and even with the head insert in. It sure isn't a quiet swing, it makes a clicking noise everytime it goes back and forth. It goes through batteries like crazy. My son has learned to unhook the tray and when he does he just about falls out. I'm not happy with it at all. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the pattern is very nice. I went and bought the linkadoos take along swing, which I love and am completely satisfied with. Never register for an item or buy an item just because you like the pattern and want a matching set, you may end up with something you hate :)",2005,1130025600B0002FQVJCA2KGWNYIE7KLLA,B0002FQVJC,A2KGWNYIE7KLLA
510,positive,Great Fun!,My daughter is almost 5 months and has been playing in this gym for a few months now. She loves it! The mirror mesmerizes her and she loves pulling at the toys.My only complaint - the music has to be restarted too often!,2004,1098489600B0000936LRA3RNNYB2OG1WMF,B0000936LR,A3RNNYB2OG1WMF
511,negative,BORING,"This bouncer is ok. When my baby was younger and I couldn't get him to go to sleep I would put him in this bouncer with the vibration on & it would put him right to sleep. Now that he is 4 months old he wont sleep in it and wont stay in it very long.  It is boring.  There are no lights or upbeat songs. There is nothing going on with it, nothing happening, nothing exciting.  I wish that there were more lights, along the sides, top, etc. and more activites.",2006,1136073600B000324Y7UA36PZ6EUGTJN2O,B000324Y7U,A36PZ6EUGTJN2O
512,positive,This blanket works great when used with Kiddopotamus & Co 100% Cotton Knit SwaddleMe Blanket,"My baby always got out of his swaddle blankets and I tried them all, including this one which he also can get out of.  BUT I found a solution that works.  If I use this blanket with the Koddpotamus & Co 100% Cotton Knit SwaddleMe Blanket he stays swaddled all night!  Amazing.  So for those of you who are desperate to have you babies stayed swaddled and nothing is working, try this and the other swaddle blanket I mentioned together.  Put this one on first and then the other one on over top.  I leave the legs out because it's the arms that cause the waking.  Ths reason I give this blanket 4 stars is because it doesn't work without the other swaddle blanket on top.",2008,1220832000B000G0J5FUA3DPG6BP8DDO1V,B000G0J5FU,A3DPG6BP8DDO1V
513,positive,The best on the market,"This swing has been fabulous!Since our baby was born, we have puthim in it to soothe him and it has beengreat watching him swing and grow into it.It's brought lots of smiles and glee for babyand a breather for the parents.Our baby is 12 months old now and can stillswing in it. These days, I put him in it in the morningto watch a Baby Einstein DVD and he loves it!He's loved to watch the lights come on and off andhas loved the fish mobile. We have enjoyed having the differentspeed settings and have never had trouble with strange motor sounds coming from the mobile.

515,positive,"Necessary for use, but a bit fragile","I dropped one of my caps on the ground and snapped the part off that the tube goes over.  Due to that I decided to order several extras and was glad to see that they cost less than $1 each.  These are the exact caps that came with my pump, so I have no complaints other than I wish Ameda made them a bit sturdier.",2009,1255564800B000GE9ZFQAU7TML120DSKT,B000GE9ZFQ,AU7TML120DSKT
516,positive,Works great...,"Alright, so these really do a great job of keeping out the sun, but boy are they ugly. I had a hard time putting them up straight and keeping out the bubbles. Make sure your windows are not cold when you apply them, otherwise they won't stick.I like them because, like I said, they kept the sun out of my son's eyes, but they are an eyesore. At least from the inside of the car. Maybe that's my fault, I don't know.I wish they could make these like real static cling that you can dip into water then squeegee them onto the window.Also, be careful when you look behind you, when you change lanes. These darken the windows a lot and it is sometimes difficult to see through.",2008,1207699200B00081L2Q2A1E29194QNFHFG,B00081L2Q2,A1E29194QNFHFG
517,positive,Great for the Nursery,"We have a the NoJo Jungle Babies 6-piece crib set as well as the wall stickers and these hangings.  The hangings are great for the nursery with interesting characters, great colors, and a mixture of fabrics for depth and texture.  They are made from the same materials as the comforter so match perfectly.  They can be thrown in the washing machine when they get too dusty and hold up well.",2009,1257897600B00005CBBFAS8V12QAP5YYL,B00005CBBF,AS8V12QAP5YYL
518,negative,Not Even Worth The Sale Price,"These pads are terrible. I used the Avent disposables which are the absolute best,  so I thought their washables would be good as well. Well that was a big mistake. They curve outward instead of following the natural curve of the breast, making them visible under any type of shirt or sweater. I figured I could use them when I was home. Then I got tired of changing clothes from all the leaks I experienced. These pads don't absorb much at all. What I was saving on disposables, I was wasting on detergent and time.",2003,1044921600B000063XV4A307YFSORUAXSQ,B000063XV4,A307YFSORUAXSQ
519,positive,Love it!,This is a great swing and my daughter loves it.  She likes to look at the moving birds and leaves at the top.  I love that you can change swinging directions.  Worth every penny!,2006,1145318400B0001IU5HYA2TI3FHD95F7LA,B0001IU5HY,A2TI3FHD95F7LA
520,positive,Basic and good value,"This mattress pad fits my Graco pack n play perfectly.  I especially like how it makes the pack n play seem a little more comfortable without compromising safety.  It has 2 layers, the cotton quilted layer and a separate VINYL waterproof layer.  I would have preferred a polyurethane waterproofing, but this mattress pad does a good job and appears to be of good quality so far.",2009,1234224000B000BPMJR6A26LN298TLQ7QC,B000BPMJR6,A26LN298TLQ7QC
521,positive,Very helpful,"I purchased this item before a family vacation and it is a very helpful tool.  You simply press the timer for a diaper change, feeding, and for sleep.  There's also a fourth timer of your choice.  It has a clock, a light, a backlight to see the numbers in the dark, and even a little reminder at the bottom for which side you last breastfed from.  While we still like to write down times to keep track, I really like having the Itzbeen.  It's nice to look at it and quickly see how long they have been sleeping, etc.  The only thing is that sometimes it's just easier to note the time if you don't have the Itzbeen with you.  You can't input a time, they are just timers.  In any case, it certainly doesn't hurt to have an extra tool around.  I think it would have really been helpful those first few weeks!",2007,1184803200B000MEB3GEA2VFN3QE5DD3DT,B000MEB3GE,A2VFN3QE5DD3DT
